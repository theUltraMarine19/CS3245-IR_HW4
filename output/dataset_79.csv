      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 McCLELLAN J: The appellant was convicted by a jury of the murder of her husband, Robert Keith Grosse at Rocky Point between 30 June 1995 and 31 July 1995. She appeals her conviction and seeks leave to appeal her sentence. 
      
       
     2 The Crown case was that the appellant and the deceased were married and had lived together in a house at Rocky Point. The deceased was a bricklayer and the house was constructed on land owned by the appellant. The relationship between them had been turbulent and at various times the deceased had left the home to live in a caravan park. The deceased had a criminal record, including convictions for assaulting the appellant. During one of their physical exchanges the appellant had bitten the deceased's ear. The Crown also alleged the appellant had, by means of false documents, secured a divorce from the deceased, of which he was unaware. 
      
       
     3 At some time before 1 July 1995, being the date upon which the Crown says the deceased was killed, the Crown alleged that the appellant decided that she would prefer a new partner and determined that it was necessary for her to kill the deceased. 
      
       
     4 On 30 June 1995 the deceased worked as usual for his employer. He was a reliable worker and the evidence disclosed that he drank little. On the following day, 1 July, the appellant drove the deceased to work where he appeared to be obviously unwell and unable to walk unaided. He was not drunk. After discussion about taking him to Wyong Hospital, the appellant took the deceased away. The Crown alleges that the appellant took the deceased home where she took advantage of his weakened stage, strangled him with a piece of cord or twine and buried him under a concrete slab under the house. 
      
       
     5 The appellant gave different accounts of the events of that day to different people. She did not acknowledge killing the deceased until much later. 
      
       
     6 On 3 July the appellant went to Goulburn where she met the man she proposed to live with, Mr Weaver, who was with his daughter, Carla. They stayed in a motel that night and on 4 July 1995 Mr Weaver and his daughter moved into the appellant's house. Mr Weaver remained for only a short period and on 19 July he left with his daughter and moved to a caravan park and then interstate. 
      
       
     7 The appellant gave a version of the events to the deceased's employer, Charles Frost. Frost reported the disappearance of the deceased and police inquiries were commenced. Of significance was the evidence of Margaret Blinman, who was a friend of the appellant.  
      
       
     8 In June 1995 the appellant told Miss Blinman that Mr Weaver was moving in on 4 July and that the deceased would have to go. On 2 July 1995 the appellant told Miss Blinman that she had driven the deceased to a medical centre and that he had then gone. The appellant gave a different version of the events to police. She told them that she had taken the deceased to Gosford railway station to enable him to go to a doctor in Sydney and that the deceased had telephoned her on 2 and 4 July 1995. Telephone records did not indicate that these calls had taken place and there is no evidence that medical assistance was sought. 
      
       
     9 On 24 July 1997 warrants were obtained pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Listening Devices Act 1984 for the use of listening devices in the appellant's residence. On the same day a warrant was obtained to search the premises. The search was carried out and revealed the decomposed body of the deceased beneath a concrete slab under the house. 
      
       
     10 Thereafter in conversations which were recorded pursuant to the listening device warrants, the appellant admitted that the body the police had found was that of the deceased and that she had used some twine to strangle him. The appellant declined to be interviewed but made a handwritten statement to the police. I have related the relevant details from that statement later in these reasons.  
      
       
     11 On 15 December 1997 in a telephone call the appellant told Mr Weaver that she had poisoned the deceased and strangled him at the kitchen table on a date that was identified by him as 18 July 1995.  
      
       
     12 Post mortem evidence from a forensic pathologist indicated that the circumstances of the death were consistent with strangulation by ligature. Because of the state of the deceased's body it was not possible to determine whether or not, as had been suggested, any poison or other substances had been ingested by him.  
      
       
     13 On 15 December 1999 the jury found the appellant guilty of murder. On 22 February 2000 his Honour sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment for seventeen years, comprising a minimum term of thirteen years commencing on 6 December 1999 and ending on 5 December 2012, and an additional term of four years, commencing on 6 December 2012 and ending on 5 December 2016.  
      
       
     14 As I have indicated, the appellant appeals against her conviction and seeks leave to appeal against her sentence.  
      
       
     15 The appellant has provided a detailed written submission. The matters which the appellant advances, as I understand them, are, firstly, the jury was not adequately instructed in relation to provocation; secondly, manslaughter was not left to the jury; thirdly, the trial judge did not adequately summarise the defence case; fourthly, the jury was not given the opportunity to determine whether the appellant was suffering from such an abnormality of mind that she was not responsible for her acts; fifthly, the jury was not properly informed of the deceased's criminal record; sixthly, the jury was not adequately informed of the position of the deceased's tongue and accordingly the evidence of the forensic pathologist as to the manner and cause of death should not be accepted; seventh, the appellant submits there is fresh evidence and, finally, the appellant catalogues thirty separate matters in which she complains of the findings of the jury, the conduct of her defence counsel and draws attention to the conduct of the deceased, including his sexual conduct and other matters.  
      
       
     16 In order to dispose of this appeal, it is necessary for me only to consider the first of the appellant's complaints. 
      
       
     17 Section 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW deals with provocation. Section 23(1) is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         ""23(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time."" 
         
        
       
     18 Section 23(4) makes plain that the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the relevant act was not done under provocation. The subsection provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “4. Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation."" 
         
        
       
     19 The issue of provocation was properly left to the jury. The evidence which related to it comes from the statement the appellant made to the police and the account of the events which she gave to her mother and others which were recorded on the listening device.  
      
       
     20 The evidence in the statement was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I wish to make a statement regarding events on the Friday 11 July, I was making a sandwich and about to watch the midday show, when Bob Grosse walked in the TV room door. He had a few whiskies and extremely shabby, he said he'd been riding the train and meals you could pick up, somewhere near Oxford Street and Newcastle, he asked how the new boyfriend was. I said there was nothing great and it was going no where. He proceeded to undress and offered himself to me. I said you're dirty and unshaven and I don't know where you've been and I'm no longer your whore of the day. An argument started and I moved into the kitchen and proceeded to cut some yellow cord and knot it to tie up my peach tree. He was drinking from a small bottle from his pocket and proceeded to tell me I wasn't worth having a good fuck (his words) with because Ian (my first husband) had spoilt and over-protected me. He said I needed a few kinky ideas, as normal his ideas and mine didn't mix. He reminded me I had nothing any more and no fellow would want me with half a tit - This hurt and was hard enough to accept, I was just beginning to move about and feel a little normal again. I was tired of his choice of words to me when drinking, such as I'm only a fuckin bitch. No one had ever spoken like this ever to me and I loathed this frequent phrase - especially when he had a drink or two. He began to rubbish my son Brett. He was a 'little smartarse', because he built his own steel shed and home. He thinks he's got it all with his fat black widow, meaning his wife Sue. I wasn't at all impressed. Brett never did nothing to him nor Sue. Even on our last holiday with them, when an argument erupted Bob began throwing punches Brett said I won’t hit an old man like you. Bob said are you gutless too - Brett said get out and off the property and ordered me to take him and don't come back. Perhaps the words were slightly different, but meant the same. We packed and moved. I had a great closeness with Brett, he was always there. Checked my car, the battery, tyres, the motor every time I visited. I didn't like abuse about him - Bob was still half dressed and offering himself among his foul outbursts and I couldn't cope with sarcasm of Ian - as he was remarried and even at family funerals, we have no communication to-gether and so slinging off about our marriage back in 50-70 was a cutting point, I have five children to this marriage and there were certain precious moments that didn't need destroying and I chose to keep these memories to myself. This was quite different to the filthy whore type sex he was talking about. He suggested I watch good videos and do things which I dislike and then said he should tie me up, fuck me up the arse and then P all over me. Because I screamed get out, he picked up the cord and was going to choke me, like he should of done to Margaret (his former wife). We struggled, when free I went outside, I was hurt, angry, fed up and sick of life, hated my breast operation and myself, I felt incomplete as a woman unloved and alone, none of my children were close to me and I couldn't unwind to Craig at the caravan park. About half an hour later I came inside, he was at the table, the bottle almost empty and he had a cup of tea. He sarcastically said Is the garden the same? My house and me were alike and he hoped I'd lose it and that's why he never intended helping to pay it off and finish it. I was again like my smartarse son Brett who knew it all. 
         
        
        
         
         I walked to the table, picked up the cord, threaded the cord and put it over his head and said how do you like it? The bottle fell as he grabbed at me and I pulled the cord. We scuffled he fell and I ran outside. I was gone about 2 hrs I think. I didn’t know what he was doing or what I should do perhaps he’d left or would be waiting. I went to the car and used my spare key and I drove to Fairhaven Shopping Centre. Perhaps he had left or would he be waiting. 
         
        
        
         
         When I returned Bob was still on the floor. He had the knee tucked under his knee and his head was pulled back, the cord was twisted on his arm and around the shoulder. 
         
        
        
         
         I rolled him on the floor and I knew he was dead."" 
         
        
       
     21 In the conversations which were recorded on the listening device, the appellant gives an account of the events similar to that contained in her statement. 
      
       
     22 In one conversation she says: 
      
       
        
         
         ""He called me (inaudible) I was half a woman because I had one and a half tit off and I was his. But, beggar's had to be choosers and things like that, you know. And when he talked about the way I looked shit. He came around and had a go at me and I was getting on (inaudible) why I was (inaudible) mixing it up with the one you tie up the custard apple. 
          
         … 
          
         ""(inaudible) and put it round the tree and pull it like I usually do and he come around (inaudible) there at me. And I just went off the deep end and (inaudible) called me a bitch (sounds like) strangled me (inaudible)."" 
         
        
       
     23 The appellant later said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""You know. (inaudible) the way I talk to men, so I just sat there and the rope was still out the back on the (inaudible) chair and I was (inaudible) picked it up, wrapped it round his neck (inaudible). And I just said how do you like it? That's what you've done to me a few times. Didn't like it back. And of course (inaudible). He fell on the floor and I went and got (inaudible) and picked up out the front of (inaudible) underneath that hole, put him in there and (inaudible)."" 
         
        
       
     24 There was another conversation which was recorded when the appellant's mother was present, as were a number of other persons. One person is recorded as asking the appellant: ""Did you do it?"" Another person says: ""No, you're not"". The first person says, ""Why not? You shouldn't have told me. I never wanted to know.""  
      
       
     25 The appellant says, ""You have to know. Wayne knows."" Another speaker: ""You shouldn't have told me. You can't lie now."" The appellant says: ""I'm not going to lie, I'm admitting it."" Another voice says: ""Why didn't you tell me ages ago?"" The appellant says, ""How could I?""  
      
       
     26 The appellant then says, ""I did it, mum."" The mother asks whether there was a reason and says, ""I know you probably had a reason for it."" The appellant said, ""I did have a reason: he was so abusive that day. I've written a thing out and Clerk told me last night.""  
      
       
     27 Another speaker said, ""Did you tell Clerk?"" The appellant said:  
      
       
        
         
         ""Wouldn't let me home - no. I didn't want to talk to anyone till I told youse myself. He gave me till Monday and the weekend to work it out. I rang a priest last night: he was so fucking rude. He says, 'What are you doing ringing me at this hour?' and this morning I told him he was rude and I asked him who he was and he said, 'You're so evasive I don't know.'"" 
         
        
       
     28 There was then a discussion about the circumstances followed by this statement by the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “He come in here and he threatened me. And he was going to strangle me and do things. He was forever telling me about Ian, how Ian protected my sex life, he didn't have kinky ideas and things; he rubbished Brett and he went on and on. He picked up a piece of cord that I was going to tie a peach tree up with; he was going to strangle me. I got away from him and went outside, and when I came back he was drinking at the table and the cord was there and I went over and I thought, 'I'm sick of this, I'm sick of everything.' I put the cord, looped the cord and I shoved it round his neck and I said, 'How do you like this?' and he was drinking and in between drinking and everything - and I pulled it hard, and he fell on the floor, and I ran out the door and went to Lakehaven. When I came back he was on the floor.""  
         
        
       
     29 In his directions to the jury the trial judge utilised the familiar technique of providing the jury with written directions. He correctly identified the need for the Crown to establish the elements of the crime, including that the appellant did not act under provocation. His directions included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “Provocation. The fourth issue upon which the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused did not act under provocation. The reasonable possibility that the accused acted under provocation is sufficient to reduce her crime from murder to manslaughter. 
         
        
        
         
         Provocation consists of conduct on the part of the deceased towards the accused which induces (or causes) a loss of self-control on the part of the accused.  
         If: 
           
         
        
        
         
         (a) the act of the accused in strangling the deceased with the intention of killing him, or of inflicting grievous bodily injury (meaning really serious bodily harm) upon him, resulted from a loss of self-control on her part caused by such conduct of the deceased, and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) that conduct of the deceased was such that it could have induced (or caused) an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost that person's self-control as to have formed an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased, then the accused has acted under provocation. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown must eliminate any reasonable possibility that the accused did act under provocation. It may do so by establishing beyond reasonable doubt  
         either: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) that the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased (including the intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm) did  
         not 
          result from a loss of self-control on the part of the accused;  
         or  
         
        
        
         
         (ii) that any such loss of self-control on the part of the accused had  
         not  
         been induced (or caused) by conduct on the part of the deceased towards the accused;  
         or 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) that the conduct of the deceased was  
         not 
          such as could have induced (or caused) an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown need establish  
         only one 
          of these three. It does not have to establish all of them."" 
         
        
       
     30 His Honour proceeded to explain the expressions ""loss of self-control"", ""conduct on the part of the deceased"" and ""the ordinary person"". There is no problem with these directions.  
      
       
     31 However, the jury, after retiring, sought clarification of certain matters. They asked the following question: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Can you give us clear meaning and examples of provocation and revenge?"" 
         
        
       
     32 In response to this question his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""As to your question 1, 'Can you give us clear meaning and examples of provocation and revenge?' the answer is, the meaning of provocation is as I have set out for you in your written directions. It may be defined in this way, that provocation is some act or series of acts done by the dead man to the accused which would cause, in any reasonable person, and actually did cause in the accused, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make her, for the moment, not master of her mind."" 
         
        
       
     33 There are, in my opinion, two significant problems with this direction. Firstly, s 23(2)(b) provides that provocation may be present where the conduct was such as could have relevantly induced an ordinary person to act in the relevant manner. His Honour, by introducing the word ""would"" has imposed a far more stringent test by which the jury was to assess the conduct of the deceased.  
      
       
     34 Although this would be sufficient to found error, the problems with the direction are emphasised by the words which immediately follow. By introducing to the jury a question of whether the relevant conduct ""actually did cause in the accused"" the relevant loss of control, his Honour has inadvertently suggested to the jury that the appellant was required to prove that she was actually provoked. 
      
       
     35 The problems are both confined and exaggerated by the further directions of his Honour. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is important that you consider the question of provocation in the light of the evidence in this case when deciding if the Crown has negatived provocation. I do not think it would be helpful for me to give examples, say, from other cases where provocation has been found to be negatived or where provocation has been found."" 
         
        
       
     36 These remarks of his Honour place the concept of provocation into its proper context and emphasise the obligation which the Crown bears. However, his Honour goes on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         ""It is a jury question for you to determine on the evidence in this case; in particular, whether there is evidence in this case which you accept that the accused lost her self control."" 
         
        
       
     37 From these remarks the jury would be likely to understand that before provocation was available to the appellant the jury must be satisfied that she had in fact lost her self-control. 
      
       
     38 This is further emphasised in the immediately following remarks, where his Honour says: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your question 2, 'Can provocation be considered over a length of time or only at the time of the event?' The answer is, provocation can be considered in the light of events occurring over a lengthy period of time but the loss of self-control must be present at the time of the killing. There is no need for a triggering incident. However, the conduct of the deceased must be such as would cause an ordinary person to lose self-control. Conduct giving rise to a sense of grievance or revenge such that, when the opportunity arises that opportunity is taken, will not be sufficient to amount to provocation."" 
         
        
       
     39 This paragraph suffers from the same two difficulties as his Honour's original remarks. Firstly, he introduces the word ""would"" when the statute provides ""could"". Secondly, he instructs the jury that the loss of self-control ""must be present at the time of the killing"".  
      
       
     40 In a passage which shortly follows in his Honour's directions, he returns to a correct statement of the law. He says this:  
      
       
        
         
         ""Your question 3, 'Can provocation become revenge if there is a time period between the threat and the event - how long or short can this time period be?' The answer is, provocation has a special meaning in law. It has the meaning set out in your written directions and in the definition that I have just given you in answer to your question 1."" 
         
        
       
     41 Although these remarks, which reminded the jury of the written directions, gave a correct guidance as to the law, his Honour’s remarks, when dealing with question 1, departed from the terms of the statute. The impact of the written directions would have been diminished.  
      
       
     42 The problems with the direction are reinforced in two further passages. His Honour says, firstly: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether the accused suffered loss of self-control in the present case has to be considered by you in the light of the facts which you find and whether, on those facts, the loss of self-control, if you find it to have occurred, was the response of an ordinary person in the position of the accused. I refer you to paragraph 9 of your written directions."" 
         
        
       
     43 Notwithstanding the reference to the written directions this passage, in my opinion, would have been understood by the jury to have imposed an obligation on them to determine whether in fact the appellant lost her self-control. Rather than framing the relevant question as being whether or not the Crown has discharged its onus of proving that the appellant had not lost her self-control, the jury would have understood the direction to have imposed a burden of proof upon the appellant.  
      
       
     44 Later in the further directions, his Honour returned to the relevant test and again used the word ""would"". He said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""As I have said, the loss of self-control must be present at the time of the killing, and the conduct of the deceased must be such as would cause an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have lost self-control."" 
         
        
       
     45 Having regard to these passages in his Honour's directions, I am satisfied that the jury was not properly instructed as to the approach it should take to the issue of provocation. I appreciate the difficulties which were raised once the jury had asked questions seeking clarification of the law in relation to the issue. I have no doubt his Honour was attempting to express the law in language which the jury could adequately understand. However, in his attempt his Honour has failed, in my opinion, to adequately instruct the jury that unless the jury is satisfied that the Crown has proved that the elements of provocation were not present, the appellant was entitled to be acquitted of murder.  
      
       
     46 As this inadequacy goes to one of the fundamental elements of the charge of murder, in my opinion there is no alternative but to allow the appeal.  
      
       
     47 In coming to this conclusion I appreciate that no objection was taken to his Honour’s directions by the appellant's counsel at the trial. It would appear that the appellant's counsel accepted his Honour's formulation of the law. Notwithstanding that fact, in my opinion the misdirection is such that the conviction cannot stand.  
      
       
     48 I am also mindful of the submissions of the Crown that it presented a strong case that the killing occurred on 1 July when no suggestion of provocation would arise. However, the issue of provocation was left to the jury and it is plain from their questions that in the course of their deliberations they were concerned to be properly informed in relation to that issue. Accordingly, it is not possible to conclude that the jury reasoned that the events occurred in the manner primarily contended for by the Crown. 
      
       
     49 I should also indicate that I have reviewed all of the evidence in this matter and I am satisfied that there is evidence which could have sustained a conviction on the charge of murder. For those reasons, I am of the opinion that the orders of the Court should be: 
      
       
        
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       2. Conviction recorded and sentence passed in the Court below quashed. 
        
       3. Order a new trial. 
        
       
     50 MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
      
       
     51 BELL J: I also agree.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Jason Edward Gordon Farrell, has been found guilty by a jury of the murder on 15 or 16 November 2000 at Coniston of Liam Salter-Tully. 
     
      
    2 The offender and others, including Daniel James Ezold and a young person I shall refer to as P, were living in a flat in Wollongong. The offender ordinarily lived in Melbourne and had no fixed place of residence in Wollongong. He was using the premises according to some casual arrangement he had made with the occupants. The deceased, Liam Salter-Tully, used to come occasionally to the same premises and sleep there. Presumably he, too, lacked a permanent place to live. Sometimes he broke into the flat in order to sleep there and thereby made himself unwelcome. 
     
      
    3 Ezold and P decided to put a stop to the deceased’s visits. The offender, who had by then been living at the flat for about a week, and was spending time in the company of Ezold and P, knew about the problem they were trying to solve. A couple of days before the events giving rise to the charge they spoke about the matter and decided to take action to ensure that the deceased would not return. The offender told the police that he, Ezold and P agreed to smack the deceased over the head or give him a bloody nose and tell him not to come back. He said that they put their hands out, as in a pact, like the Three Musketeers. 
     
      
    4 The offender joined in the agreement even though he scarcely knew the deceased. There was no evidence to suggest that he himself was irritated or discomfited by or had any reason to resent the deceased’s conduct.  
     
      
    5 The offender was born on 16 January 1981 and brought up in suburban Melbourne. He was the second oldest of four children. He and the eldest child, a brother, suffered violence at the hands of their mother and father. By the time the offender was thirteen years old the parents had separated, and he and his elder brother were staying with their father. Officers of the Department of Health became very concerned about their welfare. Although the family arrangements changed from time to time the offender’s overall position did not improve. He was the subject of repeated action by officers of the Department.  
     
      
    6 He began to use marijuana when he was thirteen and alcohol when he was fourteen. There was heavy use of marijuana up to the age of seventeen but from the time he began to drink he abused alcohol heavily. There was some use of amphetamines beginning at age fourteen or fifteen. He began using LSD at age sixteen. 
     
      
    7 From the age of thirteen to the age of fifteen years he lived in supported accommodation arranged by the Department. However, he did not adjust well and attempted unsuccessfully to return to his mother. After the age of fifteen he left the care of the Department and supported himself living in refuges, with peers and on the streets. He spent about eight months after leaving school working as a roof plumber. He travelled around Australia, supporting himself in itinerant work. He found himself unable to achieve stability and formed no long-term relationships. His interest was in singing rock music.  
     
      
    8 By the time he began living with Ezold and P he was addicted to the use of alcohol and well accustomed to using LSD. 
     
      
    9 On 15 November 2000 the offender, Ezold, P, a young person I shall call T and several other young people were at a flat occupied by some friends of theirs in Wollongong. They were drinking alcohol and the offender was handing out LSD. He took some of the drug himself. He gave a dose to T and she took half of it at the flat. Later on most or all of the group went to the Oxford Hotel, Crown Street, Wollongong. The offender, Ezold, P, the deceased and T were present. Young people joined or left the group from time to time during the evening. A good deal of alcohol was drunk. At the hotel T took the second half of the dose of LSD the offender had given her. 
     
      
    10 During the evening various members of the group bought alcohol from the hotel bottle shop. Two bottles of Passion Pop were purchased. The manager of the bottle shop noticed the offender during the course of the evening and decided that if he asked for more alcohol he would not serve him because he was well under its influence. 
     
      
    11 Several members of the group walked towards the beach and spent some time there. Then they turned southwards as though to walk to Port Kembla. Two of them left the group and went home by themselves, taking with them one bottle of Passion Pop. The remainder of the group continued to walk along the beach. Then present were the offender, the deceased, Ezold, P and T. The party left the beach and walked inland, eventually arriving close to the place where the deceased was killed. I am satisfied that Ezold directed the party to that place. He knew it because he had worked there not long before. It was secluded and nobody was likely to be there at that time. It was then the early hours of the morning. I think it no accident that the group went with the deceased to that remote place because I think that at least the offender and Ezold intended to kill him and hide his body.  
     
      
    12 As they walked along T heard them talking about the pact that they had made. I think that if the intention had been merely to smack the deceased on the head or give him a bloody nose they would not have found it necessary to take him to such a remote place. Such things could easily have been done on the beach.  
     
      
    13 Either the offender or Ezold started the attack by hitting the deceased on the head with the empty Passion Pop bottle. T thought that it might have been the offender, though she later doubted whether it was. The offender told the police that it was Ezold. I am satisfied that whoever landed the first blow they both hit him savagely and that things moved very fast once the attack was under way. The deceased fell where he was, which was on the level concrete forming the end of a culvert by which a tidal creek ran under a railway embankment. The offender, perhaps assisted by Ezold, pushed the deceased off the culvert and he fell about two metres onto the creek bed below. The offender made his way down to the creek bed and continued the attack without the assistance of Ezold or P. The attack was savage. He kicked the deceased and during the attack broke his jaw. The deceased was lying still with his face in the water. T thought that he might have been unconscious. The offender continued to bash and hold him, telling him that that was how Melbourne boys did it. He demanded to know the deceased’s mother’s maiden name, though the evidence does not suggest why he did so. He called for help and Ezold and P descended to the creek bed. The evidence does not suggest whether either of them assisted the offender. He caused the deceased to drown there and then. The others helped him drag the body into the culvert. 
     
      
    14 Even though he hardly knew the deceased and had no reason to wish him harm, the offender led the attack. After the execution of the pact he continued to lead. He immediately exhibited concern that others might discover what had happened. Something he did or said made Ezold think that T was a concern to the offender, but he assured the offender that T would not tell anyone. Before the group left the place the offender warned the others not to tell anyone, threatening to “top them off” if they did. He made them pick up all the cigarette ends they had dropped. He searched for the Passion Pop bottle. He was unsuccessful and police found it later on.  
     
      
    15 The creek bed was muddy and they all had mud on their footwear and clothing. When they arrived back in Wollongong the offender took them to the beach and made them wash their footwear and clothes in the sea to remove the mud. 
     
      
    16 After the killing the offender skipped and sang and expressed the intention of celebrating.  
     
      
    17 When the trial commenced the accused pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He made it plain by his counsel that he admitted having done the act causing the death of the deceased. As a result the only live issue at the trial was whether when he killed the deceased the offender intended to kill him or do him really serious injury. The circumstance put forward as raising a reasonable doubt about that intent was the effect upon the offender of the alcohol and the LSD he had taken. The jury rejected the defence contention, of course. I mention this matter because there was tendered on sentence a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Carne, dated 8 April 2002, more than a month after the jury found the offender guilty. I find myself unable to place any weight on the opinions expressed in that report because it relies to a substantial degree on an account given by the offender and accepted at face value by Dr Carne. 
     
      
    18 Dr Carne said something about the effects upon persons generally of alcohol and LSD, and it may be accepted that those effects have been observed from time to time by professionals. It does not follow, however, that the accused suffered from any of them on the night he killed the deceased. Dr Carne concluded that when he killed the deceased the offender was intoxicated with alcohol and LSD with the effect that his behaviour was not fully within his control. He says that the offender’s ability to control anger and behaviour would have been profoundly diminished.  
     
      
    19 I do not accept that opinion. It seems quite clear to me from the evidence of T that, notwithstanding the effects of alcohol upon him and notwithstanding the condition in which the manager of the bottle shop found him during the course of the previous evening, the offender was well in control of his faculties immediately before, at the time of and immediately after he killed the deceased. Persons like the offender who are used to consuming large amounts of alcohol develop ways of dealing with the effects of the drug. That is what I think happened over the hours separating the two events. The offender knew that there was a pact and he spoke about it as they walked along. He went in a businesslike way about the attack, calling for help when necessary, particularly when the time came to conceal the body. He directed a careful search designed to remove incriminating evidence from the scene and from the garments of the participants. He threatened anyone who would inform the authorities. He exhibited signs of having being pleased with what he had done.  
     
      
    20 I accept the evidence of T that during the course of the evening the offender complained that the LSD he had taken was of poor quality and had not had the desired effect. I am prepared to accept that the effect of alcohol and LSD, to the extent that they still bore upon him at the time of the killing, was to disinhibit his behaviour but I do not consider that a mitigating feature. 
     
      
    21 I am satisfied, contrary to the submissions of his Counsel on sentence, that the murder was premeditated. 
     
      
    22 It was submitted by Counsel for the offender that he was genuinely remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. The claim for remorse was based principally on a letter written by the offender on 12 April 2002 and tendered on sentence. It says this in part - 
     
      
       
        
        I cannot change what took place, all I can do is take responsibility for the actions I took so I have to stay in the bed I made. I think about what happened every day and I will for the rest of my life and I will never be able to deal with the things that occurred. And this is the regret and guilty shown that I will have to deal with. I wish that this hadn’t happened. 
        
       
       
      … 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        But I deserve this punishment for my actions taken and a hefty punishment is needed to even start to rectify my actions taken. And I have to live with my convictions but it was never my intention for this action to be taken. But in my actions taken a young man has died which is the most horrible thing that I have done. I have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for my actions and hope that my punishment will give others peace of mind. 
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
        
        The torment will live inside me because life is a very special thing and because of my actions taken Liam’s life has been taken away so I hang my head in shame. All I can do is try and better myself and pay the price. 
        
       
      
    23 I have difficulty in accepting these statements at face value, first because the manner in which the letter was put before the Court made them untestable. The offender did not give evidence on sentence. Secondly, the offender has continually given accounts to others which have been at once untruthful and designed to put him and his actions in the best light. For example, he gave the police a graduated series of accounts, beginning by expressing doubt whether he knew anyone called Liam and claiming to remember nothing about the evening, so badly was he affected by alcohol. Then, presumably because he realised that the police had been given a detailed account of his movements, he said that three of them just smacked the deceased and that it was nothing serious. He then said that the violence occurred all of a sudden and that he only punched the deceased. He said that when he left the deceased he was not dead and was moving a little bit.  
     
      
    24 Thirdly, the facts as I have found them show that it was false for the offender to say in his letter that it was never his intention for his action to be taken.  
     
      
    25 Accordingly, I think that he exaggerates. 
     
      
    26 Even though he is not yet prepared to come to a full and open acknowledgement of what he has done, I think that the offender is sorry that things happened as they did. He is young and has no relevant criminal record. Notwithstanding his unfortunate family circumstances he has the firm support of an uncle who has been visiting him regularly in custody.  
     
      
    27 I accept that the offender’s resort to alcohol and other drugs has been at least in part in response to the difficult circumstances of his upbringing and I accept the evidence of Dr Lennings, psychologist, that he has a major alcohol problem and may have become dependent on the drug. It is to the offender’s credit that he has attended regularly on a drug and alcohol counsellor and on a psychologist during his time in custody. 
     
      
    28 I think that the offender has some prospects of rehabilitation and that he may make good progress during the long time he must spend in custody and the substantial period he will have on parole afterwards. I agree with Counsel that a lot has to be done to achieve the offender’s rehabilitation, but not that an extended period of parole is thereby indicated.  
     
      
    29 The plea of guilty to manslaughter at the commencement of the trial effected no significant shortening of the trial and was not, I think, intended to have any such effect. Consequently it does not sound in mitigation of sentence. No submission was made to that effect. 
     
      
    30 Counsel submitted that the offender’s sentence should be no greater than that passed on Ezold. In deciding upon the sentence that I should impose I have taken into account all the circumstances I have discussed. I think that the offender’s sentence should exceed that imposed on Ezold and the significant features that make this necessary are that the offender did the act causing death and that then and at other significant times he directed the activities of those concerned. There are also my reservations about the offender’s claim to be fully contrite.  
     
      
    31 Jason Edward Gordon Farrell, you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of eighteen years commencing on 19 November 2000 and expiring on 18 November 2018. I fix a non-parole period of thirteen years six months which will expire on 18 May 2014. You will be eligible for release on parole on that day.

      CORAM: PETERSON J DATE: 16 NOVEMBER 2001Matter No IRC5579 of 1999 WORKCOVER AUTHORITY OF NSW (INSPECTOR MALTBY) v KEVIN R SHEATHER ELECTRICAL SERVICES PTY LIMITEDProsecution under s16(1) of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 1983. 
      
      JUDGMENT RE PENALTY 
     1 On 10 April 2001 I gave judgment on the issue of liability in respect of two charges brought by the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales through Inspector Maltby against Kevin R Sheather Electrical Services Pty. Limited. One charge, in respect of which the defendant was acquitted, involved an allegation that the defendant had failed to provide a safe system of work for two employees of Bankstown Personnel, a labour hire firm, who were working upon electrical installation work at the Woolworths Town Hall site. The charge in respect of which a conviction was recorded on that occasion involved an allegation of a failure to properly and adequately supervise the two workers. This judgment concerns the issue of penalty, in respect of which the parties have subsequently addressed.2 On 15 October 1997 an electrical explosion occurred within an essential services switchboard when the two workers concerned were installing pyrotenax cables by one person pushing and one person pulling the stiff copper cable through holes they had drilled in the metal wall of the switchboard. The cable appears to have contacted live copper bus bars in the switchboard causing the explosion and the resultant injuries to the employees. The facts of the matter are set out in detail in my judgment of 10 April 2001, which followed the defendant having pleaded not guilty to both charges. I do not intend to repeat the facts here although it is necessary that I make some brief reference to pertinent aspects of them.3 The nature of the breach found against the defendant relates to what was its failure to adequately supervise the persons concerned, one of whom was a very experienced electrical tradesman with more than 20 years experience, including heavy industry experience, and another who held himself out as a tradesman but in reality was a trades assistant. It was the latter who was pushing the cabling through the switchboard wall, the tradesman being on the live side of the wall pulling the cable into the vicinity of the live bus bars. These persons knew the bus bars to be live. 4 By my earlier judgment I did not find it established that the defendant had required workers to carry out this work, despite the assertion of the trades assistant that they had been so instructed. The relevant failure lay in not providing supervision of the persons who were known to be enthusiastic to do the work, able to do it by virtue of a temporal opportunity and enabled to do it by the provision of spare parts supplied by the defendant without any understanding or check of the purpose for which they were being supplied.5 The defendant adduced oral evidence in relation to penalty from Phillip Douglas Paull, one of the three directors of the defendant company. Mr Paull had undertaken an apprenticeship as an electrical fitter between 1956 and 1960 and in 1961 was employed by the defendant company. He progressed to the position of General Manager and in 1996, together with the two other persons who are now directors, acquired the shares in the defendant company.6 The defendant employs 60 full-time employees. It has work in hand of approximately $4 million value, although margins are now slighter as a result of the post-Olympic slump. 7 The defendant has for 12 years produced and updated regularly a substantial document entitled Employees Guide to Safety. It constitutes a safety programme which is implemented through the defendant's foreman. A copy of the Guide is handed to employees upon their commencement. The Guide deals with many aspects of safe working relevant to the industry in which the defendant operates and appears to be a useful general guide for its purpose. 8 In addition, for the past four years (apparently as a development from the accident the subject of these proceedings) the defendant has published in relation to each particular construction job upon which it works, a particularised document dealing with the site. That document is entitled ""Employees Guide to Safety at Places of Work in the Electrical Contracting Industry"". The example in evidence carried the additional description of ""Woolworths Westfields Hornsby"" indicating its obvious application to a particular job upon which the employees were to work. Also tendered in evidence was a list of projects upon which the defendant had performed work over recent years. Many projects involved Woolworths' retail stores in most states of Australia. Other projects included retirement villages, bank buildings, the Moore Park Supa Centre and other shopping centres.9 Oral evidence was also adduced from Kevin John Hickson, who is a project manager employed by the defendant. Mr Hickson's evidence dealt with the development of the site specific safety instruction documents and the role he played in that regard. He detailed the various registers now kept by the defendant, such as that of hazardous substances; another of safety equipment; another concerning safety induction and a skills competency register which informs the defendant of the sort of training its employees and others have had before they commence work on site. 10 Ms McDonald for the prosecutor referred to the purposes of punishment as being the application of both a specific deterrence to the offender and a general deterrence to the community (per the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476). It was necessary that the Court assess the objective seriousness of the offence charged and that will be indicated by the nature and quality of the offence (Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Limited v WorkCover (1999) 90 IR 464 at 474).11 It was submitted that the imposition of a substantial penalty is called for in this case having regard to the nature and quality of the offence which involved obvious and foreseeable risks, the need for deterrence and the maximum penalty applicable of $550,000. She referred to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Howland (Unreported [1999] NSWCCA 10): 
      
       
        
        ""41. . . . the community has indicated that it wishes to denounce this conduct in the strongest terms . . . by increases in the maximum sentences, the community, acting through the Parliament, has indicated that this is a crime which it wishes to denounce and deter. It is the duty of the Judges to reflect this community concern."" 
        
       
     12 As to the nature and quality of the offence, Ms McDonald submitted that the degree of seriousness of the breach was great having regard to the gravity of the injury suffered which is reflective of that seriousness (Tyler v Sydney Electricity per Hill J (1993) 47 IR 1 and Ferguson v Nelmac (1992) 90 IR 188 at 204 per Wright J).13 It was also submitted that the seriousness of the offence is demonstrated by the simple and straightforward steps the defendant would have been able to implement to meet its obligations under the Act. I note that this submission was directly contested by Mr Conomos. As to costs, it was submitted that the prosecutor, whilst having been unsuccessful in one prosecution concerning a safe system of work, achieved success on the matter the subject of this judgment. Costs should in these circumstances follow the event (see Inn Leisure Industries Pty Ltd v D F McCloy Pty Ltd and Anor (No 2) (1991) 28 FCR 172 at 174.14 Mr Conomos for the defendant contested certain of the submissions made on behalf of the prosecutor. For example, he submitted that the judgment of the High Court in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] (ibid) was of no utility in the present circumstances given the unique sentencing problems presenting in that case which concerned concepts of penalty and preventative detention. It was submitted that in assessing penalty the maximum penalty available under the Act would obviously call forHigh Co a very reckless disregard for human safety. The need for deterrence is understandable but it was submitted that the court is not dealing with a crime in the normal sense of the word but with an activity. It was submitted that the degree of seriousness of the breach here is at the lower end of the scale, based on the findings earlier made in the matter, and the fact the lack of supervision, which existed for only about one hour or so, involved a licensed electrician of some twenty years experience and another worker who gave the appearance and indicia of experience and indeed held himself out as a licensed of electrician. The defendant has no prior criminal record and at the date of the incident in October 1997 had operated for some 37 years without any criminal conviction. It was submitted for the defendant that each party should be ordered to pay its costs: “The case was fought long and hard, on all issues, nothing was given away. At the end of the day it turned out one-all”. 15 What the defendant has been subjected to in these proceedings is the exposure to two charges of a breach of the Act in respect of statutory offences created by the Act and in respect of which money (and other) penalties may be imposed. The offences are criminal in nature. They often involve serious failures of employers and others to observe a statutory duty designed to protect workers, the breach of which can have devastating effects by way of injury or death upon workers or others. They do not necessarily involve criminal intent as will normally be the case in crimes against the person or property. They are, nevertheless, criminal offences and must be tested according to the criminal standard of proof, namely beyond reasonable doubt. So it is, that principles applicable to the determination of criminal proceedings in the ordinary courts will be relevantly applicable in proceedings under this Act. This court has consistently applied general principles applicable in the criminal law to its reasoning and determination of proceedings under this Act. One example is the conformity adopted with the recent decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thompson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 concerning the guideline judgment on discounts applicable in a criminal proceeding where a plea of guilty is entered. (See State Rail Authority of New South Wales v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Insp. Dubois), (2000) 102 IR 218 at 236).16 In this way the judgment of the High Court (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey J in Veen v The Queen [No. 2] is instructive despite that matter involving the incarceration for life of a person twice convicted for manslaughter but remaining a continuing danger to society by reason of his mental condition. In that judgment their Honours said: 
      
       
        
        However, sentencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. 
        
       
     17 These indicators are just as applicable, where they arise, in proceedings under this Act. It, of course, remains the fundamental task of the court to assess penalty having regard to the objective and subjective features of the matter and to conform with the usual requirements as to sentencing. In respect of offences under this Act it is now very clear that the objective seriousness of the matter must be determined having regard to the nature and quality of the act. 18 In this matter the essential qualities of the matter are that the defendant failed to supervise the two workers concerned, thereby enabling them to take the steps to obtain equipment necessary to achieve the state of risk which caused the electrical explosion within the switchboard. That absence of supervision was not confined to the period during which the men were actually working on the switchboard but also extended to the opportunity afforded to them to obtain that equipment. On the other hand, regard must be had for the fact that one of the employees was a very experienced tradesman who, while now without any real memory of the incident, must have known that what he was undertaking involved dangerous activity. I have already found it not established beyond reasonable doubt that he was instructed to do this work but, in effect, took it upon himself in concert with the other employee involved, for reasons which remain unexplained. In fixing penalty, I consider I should give weight to the view that it was not readily foreseeable by Mr. Thwaites that these workers would undertake work contrary to the instruction given not to go as far as they did. It was the intervention of the supply of parts, of which he knew nothing, which exposed the defendant in this proceeding. Whereas these factors contributed to finding the offence proved, I consider the failure of the company to be only in the low to mid-range of seriousness.19 Taking into account that view, and giving due allowance for the defendants absence of prior convictions, I consider an appropriate penalty in this matter would be $110,000. The defendant is convicted and a fine in that sum is imposed with a moiety of penalty to WorkCover. 20 As to costs, I consider the defendant should meet the prosecutor's costs. While it is true that the defendant was not convicted in respect of both charges, the laying of those charges seems to me to have been a course appropriate for WorkCover to adopt. I do not consider that the acquittal in those circumstances would justify the avoidance by the defendant of a costs burden. I order that the defendant pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or, in the absence of agreement, as fixed by the Court.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: On 18 December 2001 the court pronounced orders in relation to this appeal against the conviction of the appellant on 11 August 2000 after a trial by jury presided over by Twigg DCJ, QC. These are my reasons for concurring in those orders, pursuant to which the appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered in relation to the alternative charge on which the appellant was convicted.  
      
       
     2 The appellant was charged with having sexual intercourse with Emma Kate Barrett without consent in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the offence he did by means of offensive weapon (a knife) threaten to inflict actual bodily harm to the complainant and her children. That charged a contravention of s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900.  
      
       
        
       Reasons for allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial 
        
       
     3 The reasons for allowing the appeal arise out of the following events. 
      
       
     4 On 11 August 2000 the jury retired to consider its verdict at about 11am. At 11.50am the trial judge received a written question from the jury. The question sought confirmation about whether the jury could find a verdict of sexual intercourse without consent, but also find a verdict of not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. After some debate with counsel in which s 61Q of the Crimes Act was identified as the source of the possible alternative verdict, the transcript records the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “SEGAL: The indictment only contained one count. There was no addresses taking into account the possibility of an alternative verdict, although it might have been taking the addresses as a whole, it might have been something that the jury has started to think about, but it wasn’t something that I specifically addressed, because there was only one count on the indictment and I’d prefer your Honour take the position that because of the case as run, that your Honour says to the jury, in the circumstances because the trial has run on the basis of an indictment without an alternative, although there is a legal alternative, but because of the way the trial has run up until this point of time, that your Honour say to the jury, ‘It’s not a question you can answer.’ That’s the defence response. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Segal, I propose to answer the question in the affirmative and give them the legal position. 
         
        
        
         
         JURY RETURNED TO COURT AT 12.05PM 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen I have your question, which I received at 11.50am today, 11 August, I have marked it for identification 12. I will read it onto the record. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Confirm whether the jury can find a verdict of guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, but not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The answer shortly is ‘Yes’, if you have a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the aggravating factor, but are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a sexual assault, then you would say when asked for your verdict, ‘Not guilty of the offence charged, but guilty of sexual assault.’ Such a verdict would mean that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have intercourse with her, that she did not consent and that he knew that she was not consenting, but that you were not satisfied that aggravation has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Does that make it clear Mr Foreman? 
         
        
        
         
         FOREMAN: That’s clear your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         JURY RETIRED TO FURTHER CONSIDER ITS VERDICT AT 12.08PM.” 
         
        
       
     5 The jury returned at 3.55pm. They acquitted on the count charged but convicted on the alternative count.  
      
       
     6 Ground 2 of the Notice of Appeal was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant did not receive a fair trial and was denied procedural fairness when the statutory alternative count was left to the jury.” 
         
        
       
     7 The appellant accepted that if this ground succeeded the appropriate order was an order for a new trial, not an acquittal.  
      
       
     8 The appellant submitted, first, that had the defence known that the alternative verdict was a possibility it would have cross-examined witnesses “with a view to developing submissions that the complainant put up resistance and had means of raising the alarm by means of her screaming or otherwise fighting off or discouraging an intruder”. That argument fails. That type of cross-examination was just as open on the charge actually preferred from the outset.  
      
       
     9 The appellant submitted, secondly, that his counsel had been denied any opportunity to submit “that even without the presence of a knife or threats to her children, the jury might yet not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the will of the complainant was overborne”. That argument fails. Counsel for the appellant did not ask the trial judge for that opportunity when putting submissions about the possibility of an alternative verdict.  
      
       
     10 At a very late stage counsel for the appellant supplied the court with references to R v Pureau (1990) 47 A Crim R 230 and R v Heaton (CCA, unreported, Gleeson CJ, Priestley JA and Sharpe J, 1 June 1990). They were discussed in R v Quinn (CCA, unreported, Priestley JA, Wood and McInerney JJ, 31 July 1991). At pages 17-20 of that case, Priestley JA said, discussing R v Pureau: 
      
       
        
         
         “The principle in R v Pureau (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 March 1990, Hunt, Enderby and Sharpe JJ) was relied on for this proposition. In Pureau, the appellant was charged with robbery in company with wounding. The jury found him not guilty of that, but guilty of attempting to commit that offence. No mention of an alternative verdict was made by the Crown Prosecutor in either opening or closing address, nor had counsel for the appellant addressed upon it; the issue was raised for the first time by the judge in his summing up. Hunt J delivered the principal reasons. He referred to R v Cameron [1983] 2 NSWLR 66, in which the availability of the alternative verdict had been raised by the trial judge for the first time during the course of an application for a directed verdict at the end of the Crown case. The court said: ‘In a normal case where the Crown seeks an alternative verdict, this is a matter which is open to the jury and litigated by the parties from the commencement of the Crown case. To raise the question for the first time at the conclusion of the Crown case may in many cases produce an injustice to the accused unless the situation is as clear as it was, for example, in Coughlan’s case [Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 August 1977]. It is, we believe, unwise for a trial judge to introduce these matters on his own initiative …’ (at 71). Hunt J noted that he had been a member of the court in Cameron and stood by what was said in that case. He continued: ‘The issue of alternative verdicts should be opened to the jury by the Crown. If the alternative verdict is not referred to then, it must be raised before closing addresses when the judge can rule whether the delay in raising it so late in the piece would be likely to cause injustice to the accused.  
         
        
        
         
         It must be conceded that the factual situation which gives rise to the prospect of an alternative verdict of attempt is often not apparent until the trial is under way. [He noted that that may have been so in the instant case, and continued.] The trial judge would therefore be more likely to conclude that the late raising of this particular alternative verdict had not prejudiced the accused. But it is difficult to imagine circumstances which would justify it being raised for the first time during the summing-up, when neither counsel had had at least the opportunity of addressing upon it if they had wished to.” (at 8-9) 
         
        
        
         
         However, Hunt J did not base his eventual conclusion in Pureau on the late raising of the alternative charge. Indeed, he noted that the Crown had a good argument that, in the circumstances of the case, no actual miscarriage of justice was caused to the appellant by the alternative charge not having been raised before the closing addresses. Hunt J rested his opinion on the appellant’s second point in the case, which was that the trial judge’s directions to the jury gave them no assistance as to how they should consider the Crown case on the alternative charge. His Honour’s view was that the conviction must be quashed. 
         
        
        
         
         Enderby J agreed with Hunt J, but added that he thought the most unfortunate aspect of the trial was the way in which the subject of attempt arose. He regarded what happened as being in the nature of an ambush. He said: ‘Defence counsel had no opportunity to put submissions to the jury concerning this alternative serious charge that was being levied against his client. It had not been dealt with in the addresses; it had been sprung on both counsel for the Crown and counsel for the defence by his Honour. Because of that, this trial was not a fair trial.’ Sharpe J agreed with Hunt J’s reasons. 
         
        
        
         
         The appellant in the present case also relied in this court on R v Heaton (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, Gleeson CJ, Priestley JA and Sharpe J, 1 June 1990). In that case the appellant had been charged with stealing from the person. He was found guilty of the lesser offence of simple larceny. The possibility of a conviction for stealing never arose until after final addresses. The trial judge then indicated he proposed to direct the jury that there was available an alternate verdict of simple larceny. He proceeded to sum up on that basis. In the circumstances of the particular case, Sharpe J, who gave the leading reasons, was of the view that there was a gross procedural irregularity in the course followed by the trial judge. Gleeson CJ agreed saying that a combination of two circumstances caused the serious irregularity. The first was the possible alternative verdict having been first raised by the trial judge of his own motion after final addresses; the second was that in his summing up the trial judge gave inadequate instruction as to the varying possible views of the facts that might result in one verdict rather than the other. I simply said that I agreed. It seems to me that the effect of Pureau and Heaton read in the light of earlier cases on the same topic is this: when the possibility of the jury finding a verdict against an accused on a lesser charge than that in the indictment is raised for the first time by the trial judge in the course of summing-up, then the circumstances will be rare in which taking that course will not prejudice the accused. Nevertheless, it is possible that even in such circumstances, an accused will not be prejudiced. Whether or not a subsequent verdict against the accused on the lesser charge will be quashed will depend upon the appeal court’s view whether prejudice was caused to the accused.” 
         
        
       
     11 In R v Heaton, pages 8-9, Gleeson CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There are in this case two circumstances which in combination, gave rise to a serious procedural irregularity. First, there is the circumstance that the subject matter of the possible alternative verdict was first raised by the learned trial judge of his own motion after the conclusion of final addresses.  
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, there is the circumstance that in his summing up his Honour informed the jury that it was open to them to find the appellant guilty of the lesser charge but gave them practically nothing by way of instruction as to the varying possible views of the facts of the case that might result in one verdict other than another. That was an important deficiency in the summing up and, I would add, it produced the clear risk that the jury might find the alternative verdict as a compromise without really understanding what was involved in their decision. That, in itself was something against which the jury should have been specifically warned.” 
         
        
       
     12 The appellant advanced oral argument to the effect that the trial judge did not give the jury: 
      
       
        
         
         “any guidance as to how they might assess the evidence of the plaintiff should they be considering the statutory alternative.  
         
        
        
         
         We say his Honour did not relate the particular elements of the statutory alternative to the evidence, ie there was no direction [along] the lines that should you not find the accused guilty of aggravated sexual assault you would have to find beyond reasonable doubt that being woken up, dragged down the hallway, mouth covered, biting and screaming, were enough to satisfy.  
         
        
        
         
         He further could have given a direction; you may consider whether the production of the knife was what overbore her will, the complainant, or whether the actions up to that point did in fact beyond reasonable doubt overbear her will. 
         
        
        
         
         It was left to the jury to speculate as to how they might go about properly finding a verdict of sexual assault.” 
         
        
       
     13 There is force in this argument. One matter in the present case which unquestionably could have caused prejudice was the failure of the trial judge to give directions as to the varying possible views of the facts that might result in one verdict rather than another. There was no specific warning against a compromise verdict on an ill-understood basis. Counsel for the appellant did not ask the trial judge for a warning of the kind Gleeson CJ described. However, since Gleeson CJ regarded what happened as “a serious procedural irregularity” and “an important deficiency” in R v Heaton, prima facie the appeal should be allowed. The Crown argued against this on the basis that the issue was whether failure to give a direction was unfair. It contended that the failure to give the directions in R v Pureau and R v Heaton was unfair because these cases were complicated, but the failure to give it here was not since the facts were simple. The Crown relied on Priestley JA’s references to prejudice at the end of the passage quoted above from R v Quinn. However, R v Heaton was not particularly complex, turning on the difference between stealing and simple larceny. Gleeson CJ did not regard the case as one making the warnings unnecessary, and he used the strong language already quoted. Similarly, the present case was not so simple that the risk of prejudice which the warnings are designed to obviate did not exist. Indeed, in another part of the Crown argument, it was submitted that here there was “rather a complex circumstance of aggravation”. Hence the failure to give the warning justifies allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial. The Crown did not submit that the proviso should be applied. 
      
       
     14 The only complaint in writing about the trial judge’s directions made by the appellant was that there was no direction “as to how they might assess the credibility of the complainant should they entertain a doubt about her reliability in respect of one count. They might take that into account in assessing the reliability of the complainant in relation to another count.” Since the appeal has been allowed in relation to the failure to give a R v Heaton warning, it is not necessary to consider this argument, which also underlay Ground 3. The argument could not justify any more favourable order than an order for a new trial. 
      
       
        
       Reasons for not ordering an acquittal 
        
       
     15 The complainant advanced various other arguments and contended that this Court should enter an acquittal. One discrete argument related to Ground 4. Ground 4 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant did not receive a fair trial because of the acceptance into evidence of Exhibit D, the alibi notice.” 
         
        
        
       The appellant conceded that Ground 4 on its own, even if it succeeded, could not justify a new trial. It certainly could not justify an acquittal. Accordingly it is unnecessary to consider it further. 
        
       
     16 Ground 5 was: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned trial judge did not direct the jury that versions of the complainant given to Fallon Loadsman and Melinda Miller, differing from those given to Teena Barrett and the jury on oath, were to be taken into account in assessing her credibility.” 
         
        
        
       While if that ground were made out it might justify a new trial, it would not justify an acquittal. Hence it need not be considered further.  
        
       
     17 The principal ground of appeal was Ground 1: “The verdict of guilty is inconsistent and unreasonable.”  
      
       
     18 In order to understand the arguments advanced, it is necessary to set out the appellant’s summary of the evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Narrative of complainant 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant’s evidence was that she was living at 100 Skinner St Grafton in about August 1999 with her three daughters then aged 6, 3 and 2. About two months later at the beginning of November 1999 she moved back to Sydney. The accused visited around the 1st November 1999 on the occasion of a removalist being at her premises. He left after some talk and drink. She said the accused rang her the next morning and that later that night he came asking if he could come in. A friend ‘Freddo’ was invited in to ‘say goodbye’. They both left. She said the accused returned later that night, alone. The accused said to the complainant he ‘wanted to sleep with’ her. He left the house without anything of a sexual nature occurring. The complainant left Grafton, returning a few days before Christmas.  
         
        
        
         
         The complainant went to her home in Skinner St. She had an early night, sleeping in her loungeroom. She says she was woken up as she was dragged from the loungeroom into the hallway, with the person’s hands over her eyes and mouth dragging her backwards. She bit his hand. (t/c 7.8.00 p.6 11.35-43) 
         
        
        
         
         She said he dragged her into the bedroom and dropped her on the floor. She started screaming for help and then ‘he’s pulled a knife and told me to ‘shut up’ and that he won’t hurt me or the girls, which I did.’ (p.6 11.45-50). In the bedroom at the front of the house it gets most of the light off the street. She described the knife as 30cm long with a brown handle and serrated edge. He had pointed the knife at the complainant as he said the words of threat (p.7 11.33041). The person she said was Des Currie. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant said she was told to undress which she did and penile sexual intercourse took place without her consent whilst she was scared. When he finished he ‘collapsed’ on her. She got up and walked past the girls in the loungeroom. The accused got up. There was talk and he left. 
         
        
        
         
         Thereafter the complainant packed up and went to Sydney taking the knife with her which she later used as a kitchen knife. (t/c p.9 1.49) 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant attended a doctor for a ‘morning after pill’ on 22nd December 1999, that is the day following the alleged sexual intercourse. Later that day she spoke to her niece Fallon Loadsman. She said to Fallon Loadsman ‘someone raped me last night’. Later that same day she went to a barbecue and said to her friend Melinda Miller ‘ … that fella came over and raped me at knifepoint.’ (t/c 7/8/00 pp. 13-14) 
         
        
        
         
         Reports to others and referral to police 
         
        
        
         
         Evidence was called from Fallon Loadsman, Melinda Miller and Teena Barrett. Each gave a version of what the complainant had said to them in relation to the incident. 
         
        
        
         
         To Fallon Loadsman on 22nd December 1999 the complainant said, in part that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… some queer cunt broke in and raped me last night … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … She said they (‘the kids’) were in bed beside her and they weren’t hurt …’ (t/c 8/8/00 p.20) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … The girls were in bed with me. I woke up with a knife to my throat and a hand over my mouth …’ (t/c 8/8/00 p.23 11.45-7) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           To Melinda Miller on 22nd December 1999 the complainant said, that: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… She woke up with a hand over her face and a knife at her throat and a man telling her to be quiet and he wouldn’t hurt the kids, the girls, and he then dragged her through the house and raped her …’ (t/c 8/8/00 p.25 11.31-35) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           To Teena Barrett on 9th January 2000 the complainant in part said that: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ … she’d been raped … she was asleep she woke up being dragged out of bed and pulled down the hallway and she said she bit the person on the hand and when they let go she screamed a little bit but then he pulled out a knife and told her to be quiet or he’d hurt her or the kids …’ (t/c 10/8/00 p.136 11.46-54) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           David Walker gave evidence that he had spoken to his own wife, Teena Barrett, about Emma Barrett on 9th January 2000 and the next day went to the police (t/c 9/8/00 p.75) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           William Drew went to the police on 10th January 2000 with David Walker and others. (t/c 9/78/00 p.75)

         The date of the alleged offence is accurately established as the night of 21st December 1999, the one night that the wife of the accused was in hospital. It is the Crown case that that is the night of the offence and is established by Grafton Hospital admission record Exhibit E. 
         
        
        
         
         Dr Kennedy (Ex C) established the date as 22nd December 1999 upon which the complainant was prescribed a ‘morning after pill’. …

         Evidence from Robert Goetz was to the effect that semen of the appellant was detected on the bed of the complainant. Det. Griffith cut out a portion of bed which had tested presumptively for semen. (t/c 9/8/00 p.109) 
         
        
        
         
         Movements of appellant 
         
        
        
         
         Albert Robinson referred to as Freddo gave evidence that he had visited the home of the complainant with the appellant. That there had been a visit by Freddo in the company of the appellant was not in dispute. It was crucial for the prosecution case. It was this encounter upon which the prosecution relied to establish in the mind of the complainant the name and appearance of the person ‘Des’ whom the complainant said had been the person later in her house on [the] night of 21st December 1999.  
         
        
        
         
         This visit to the home of the complainant was placed in ‘ … late October early November …’ of 1999. (t/c 8/8/00 p.31 11.23-30) 
         
        
        
         
         Patricia Cole gave evidence to the effect that the evening that Deidre, the wife of the appellant had been in hospital, that he had visited her between 5 and 7 in the evening and again between 9 and 11pm. (t/c 9/8/00 p.116) 
         
        
        
         
         Kenneth Currie, the father of the appellant, was staying at the home of the appellant and his wife. He gave evidence to the effect that he had gone to bed at 9 or 10 on the evening that Deidre was in hospital. The appellant said he was going to the hospital. He next saw the appellant in the early morning, at ‘ … 3 o’clock or something – not sure …’ (t/c 9/8/00 p.121 1.45 – p.122 1.5) 
         
        
        
         
         Detective King gave evidence as to the alibi notice which was tendered Ex D following objection. (t/c 9/8/00 p.58) The notice referred to the two witnesses mentioned above, Patricia Cole and Kenneth Currie. 
         
        
        
         
         Defence evidence 
         
        
        
         
         The accused gave evidence. He denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant around 21st December 1999. (t/c 10/8/00 extract p.4) On 21st December 1999 he had visited his wife in hospital and taken her a meal. He had gone back to Trish (Patricia) Cole’s and returned a dinner plate. He had the intention of visiting the hospital again but had run out of petrol and left his car near the hospital. He had made his way home by way of a lift with Bunon Walker. His father was sleeping in the loungeroom but awoke. The accused went to sleep and did not leave the house until next morning. 
         
        
        
         
         On the next morning he put petrol in his car and picked up his wife from hospital. (t/c 10/8/00 p.6) He had no bite marks on his hand when he picked his wife up.  
         
        
        
         
         He said he had visited the home of the complainant with Albert Robinson (Freddo) previously They had smoked marijuana. There was a truck driver there. (t/c 10/8/00 extract p.8) He took Freddo home and returned to the complainant’s place. The truck driver was there. Alcohol was drunk. The truck driver left. The appellant and the complainant had sexual intercourse on the bed. He ejaculated outside of the person of the complainant. He did not see the complainant again after that. (t/c 10/8/00 extract p.9) 
         
        
        
         
         Deidre Currie the wife of the appellant gave evidence. She said the appellant had told her after he was charged that he had sex with the complainant but prior to the night she had been in hospital. (t/c 10/8/00 p.145 1.55) She said that she had seen no bite marks after being released from hospital, which was the continuation of the day after the night of the alleged sexual assault. (t/c 10/8/00 p.149)” 
         
        
       
     19 The arguments of the appellant in support of Ground 1 were lengthy and to some degree inconsequential. The background to the key arguments pointed to differences in the terms of the three complaints made; lateness of complaint to the police (which prevented them ascertaining whether there was a bite mark on the appellant); and unsatisfactory circumstances of identification. Yet no submissions were put that the appeal should succeed because of failure to give a direction pursuant to Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79; or because the identification evidence was inadmissible; or because no satisfactory warning about the identification evidence was given; or because the complaint evidence was wrongly admitted; or because the complaint evidence should have been admitted only on a limited basis. The arguments in relation to these matters do not justify either lengthy examination or a conclusion that the appeal should be upheld. Rather it is necessary to concentrate on the three key arguments advanced, which were these. First, acquittal on the count charged and conviction on the alternative count represented a compromise between a verdict of sexual intercourse without consent and with the use of a knife, on the one hand, and a finding that there had been consensual intercourse, leading to acquittal, on the other. Secondly, the different versions given by the complainant to the court and to the hearers of her complaints revealed unreasonableness. Thirdly, the acquittal on the count charged meant that the jury had disbelieved the complainant on her evidence as to the use of a knife and it followed that she ought also to have been disbelieved on whether she consented or not.  
      
       
        
       Appellant’s compromise verdict arguments 
        
       
     20 The specific arguments advanced on this issue were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The jury asked a question before evidence was concluded as to whether the complainant had mentioned a knife in the statement to Det King (which she had). This indicates the concern of the jury or one of their number about the ‘knife’ issue. The question was at lunchtime on 10th August 2000 before evidence was completed as to whether the complainant had mentioned a knife in the first instance to Det King. (t/c p.30 10/8/00) 
         
        
        
         
         The Learned Trial Judge at the outset indicated sitting times, and that they went to 4 pm under normal circumstances unless there was a request for variation. Whilst not a criticism of his Honour, it is noted that no request was made of the jury on the Friday on their retirement as to whether they would like to sit on or come back on another day (be it Saturday or Monday).  
         
        
        
         
         The jury retired shortly after 11.00am on the 11th August 2000, his Honour having commenced summing up shortly after 10am that day. (Transcript reference to 10/08 s/u p.22 11/8/00 is inaccurate). The jury question came at 11.50am, within an hour of retiring. The verdict came at 3.55 on the Friday afternoon, five minutes before the scheduled end of the day’s sitting. His Honour had said on day one that the court would sit until 4pm with special arrangements possible on request (t/c p.10 7/8/00), but the coincidence of verdict as 5 minutes to 4 is noted. 
         
        
        
         
         That is, the jury deliberated for nearly 4 hours after redirection as to an alternate verdict. They returned a verdict 5 minutes before scheduled end of the day’s sitting on a Friday afternoon, the judge having given no specific direction that the jury could deliberate beyond 4pm.” 
         
        
       
     21 The appellant also submitted that the jurors would have known that the alternative verdict carried a lower sentence.  
      
       
     Appellant’s arguments on the different versions 
      
       
     22 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “That the verdict is unreasonable may be tested against different versions given by the complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         The versions to others are admissible as first hand hearsay. They are evidence as to the truth of that which is asserted. (Evidence Act s60) 
         
        
        
         
         On the 22nd December 1999 the complainant told both Fallon Loadsman and Melinda Miller that she had been woken in the loungeroom next to her children with a knife at her throat and a hand over her mouth or face. 
         
        
        
         
         By 9th January 2000 the version was different as delivered to Teena Barrett to the effect that a knife had been produced at least in the hallway and after she had screamed. 
         
        
        
         
         The version directly to the jury accorded with that of 9th January 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         The result is that the complainant has provided directly or indirectly, evidence of the fact as to what really happened which is contradictory and impossible to reconcile. That is, the knife and threat to children occurred from the start, and, the knife was produced after dragging, biting and screaming.” 
         
        
        
       Appellant’s arguments on inconsistency between disbelieving the complainant about the knife and believing her about non-consent 
        
       
     23 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is nothing in the surrounding circumstances of the facts associated with the two verdicts in this appeal which distinguishes the reasoning of the jury as between one count and the other. The bald conclusion is that version of the complainant was not accepted. The quality of the complainant’s evidence as to her assertion as to the use of a knife was just as strong in relation to every other aspect of her version. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         It is here submitted that inconsistency between the verdict of not guilty to the count of aggravated sexual intercourse on the indictment and the verdict of guilty to the statutory alternative of sexual assault simpliciter is not logical and reasonable. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The verdict it is submitted remains logically insupportable. On the one hand the jury appears to have accepted the complainant as to identification but does not accept the version of the complainant as to a crucial element. The presence of semen was supportive of either the version of the complainant or the appellant and so had no real bearing on the verdict.” 
         
        
       
     24 The appellant also submitted that the jury rejected the appellant’s evidence that a knife had been used, and that left the appellant’s evidence of non-consent without support: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is respectfully submitted that it would be a too superficial analysis to say that the will of the complainant was overcome by being woken, dragged down the hall and dropped in the bedroom. On the version of her oral evidence she had prior to the production of a knife been able to bite the intruder with a ‘full bite’ enough for the man to take his hand off her mouth. (t/c 8/8/00 p.24 11.10-20). Further, she had the presence of mind to scream. These are indicia of capable resistance. It was only after the production of the knife and the threat to her children that her resistance subsided. 
         
        
        
         
         The significance of the production of the knife is greater based on the version given to Teena Barrett. The complainant said prior to the knife she had ‘ … screamed a little bit but then he pulled out a knife …’ (t/c 10/8/00 p.136 1.50). This ceased with the production of the knife indicating that in the mind of the complainant she had not given up on screaming as a mode of coping with the situation. She had not fully completed the screaming self protection mechanism before it was cut short by the production of a knife.  
         
        
        
         
         The house being in a residential area, if sparsely housed. There was a street which ran outside and at least one of the house windows was open. The street outside was serviced with street lights. The complainant screamed loudly twice. She said ‘help, help’ at the top of her voice. When she saw the knife she did not scream thereafter. (t/c 8/8/00 p.31) 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant lived with her daughters as a family unit. One of them at least, aged 6, was of an age where she could raise an alarm if awoken by her mother’s screams. Unsavoury as the prospect is of being saved from rape by one’s child, it cannot be taken for granted that without proof of the use of the knife there was discrete proof beyond reasonable doubt of the absence of consent to sexual assault.” 
         
        
        
       Crown arguments 
        
       
     25 The Crown submitted that for the appellant to succeed he had to show that the verdict of guilty is “unreasonable and cannot be supported”: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6. That depends on whether “upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494-5. That test applies as much to cases involving an alleged inconsistency between an acquittal and a conviction as to other cases: R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [3]-[10]. The Crown referred to MacKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367:  
      
       
        
         
         “Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”  
         
        
       
     26 The Crown also referred to M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to these considerations.” 
         
        
       
     27 The Crown then pointed to the detail of the complainant’s account in evidence in chief, her adherence to that version in cross-examination, the substantial confirmation of it by three early complaints and by her attendance the next day for emergency contraception, the fact that the occurrence of sexual intercourse was confirmed by DNA evidence pointing strongly towards the appellant, and the fact that the appellant’s alibi was far from complete, leaving him ample time to have sexual intercourse on the night of 21-22 December (which he denied, though he admitted consensual sexual intercourse on an earlier occasion). The Crown submitted that there was evidence to support every element of the charge on which the appellant was convicted.  
      
       
     28 The Crown then submitted that the crime was not non-consensual intercourse while having a knife, but non-consensual intercourse coupled with a threat to inflict actually bodily harm with a knife. The Crown submitted that the jury may have accepted that the appellant had a knife, but not that its use accompanied by a statement that the complainant should shut up and that she and the girls would not be hurt amounted to a threat to cause actual bodily harm by use of a knife. That is, it was submitted that the jury construed what happened as a statement that the appellant would not harm the complainant or her children, not as a threat that he would. Or, it was submitted, the jury may have accepted the complainant’s evidence of what was said and treated it as a threat, but only “a pretty wishy-washy threat, … not a threat to inflict actual bodily harm on her or the children by means of that knife. Hence the acquittal did not have any adverse impact on the complainant’s credibility.” 
      
       
     29 The Crown also submitted that even if the correct view is that the jury was not satisfied that a knife was used at all, there was no inconsistency: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is necessary to distinguish between a case where a jury may not accept the complainant’s version in a particular respect and cases where a jury rejects the substance of the evidence (this distinction was referred to by Spigelman CJ in  
         R v Markuleski 
          … at [79]. The jury may have accepted the basic story of the complainant at less than the full alleged detail for a variety of reasons. One such reason may have concerned the particular circumstances in which the observations of the knife was made, the complainant had just been woken and dragged from her bed, she was screaming, the room was very dark, she did not see where the knife came from, and she did not know what he did with it after he pointed it (TR 7/8/00 6-7) (T 8/8/00 3). 
         
        
        
         
         It must be remembered that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing both the appellant and the complainant and clearly believed the substance of the complainant’s evidence, which was sufficient to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence of sexual assault.” 
         
        
        
       Though the darkness may also have prevented reliable identification being made initially, the complainant had good opportunities for observation before the appellant left. She did not have such good opportunities in relation to the use of the knife. In short, the jury was entitled to accept parts of the complainant’s evidence even if it did not accept other parts: it did not follow from non-acceptance of the part about the knife that the jury rejected or should have rejected the substance of the complainant’s evidence.  
        
       
     30 The Crown responded to the submission of the appellant that if there was no proof that the knife was used, there was insufficient evidence to infer a lack of consent by submitting: 
      
       
        
         
         “There was other cogent evidence of lack of consent and knowledge of lack of consent such as: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the uninvited entry of the appellant to the complainant’s home at night; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the forceful dragging of the complainant from her bed, in the loungeroom, along the length of the hallway to the bedroom; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the biting of the hand of the appellant; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the complainant’s screaming for help; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the appellant’s orders to the complainant to get undressed and to lay on the bed; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the complainant’s protests, ‘No’ and ‘Just don’t’; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the appellant’s oral threats during the assault, ‘Do you want to see me get wild, do you want to see me get wild with you, just be quiet’; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           the complainant’s evidence that she felt sick and scared and did not consent.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     31 In relation to the different versions given by the complainant, the Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “An analysis of the evidence of ‘different versions’, shows that the only difference between the complainant’s account and that given by Ms Loadsman and Ms Miller was that they both reported that the complainant had said that she had woken up with a knife at her throat, whereas the account given by the complainant, and as reported by Ms Barrett, was that the knife was produced later. Whilst that difference could possibly have contributed to the jury not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the aggravating factor, the difference was not such that the jury were required thereby to reject the substance of the complainant’s evidence.” 
         
        
       
     32 In relation to the compromise question, the Crown submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is no evidence that the verdict of guilty on the alternative charge was a compromise verdict. Whilst Barr J found that in the circumstances of the particular case in  
         R v Robinson 
          [2000] NSWCCA 59, that it was highly probable that members of the jury had made a compromise in order to bring matters to an end, that was in the context of a finding that the verdict in the case were inconsistent and called for an explanation which could not otherwise be found. 
         
        
        
         
         As submitted above, in this case there was no inconsistency justifying an analysis of the timing of the verdict. In the absence of any inconsistency, there is no basis for interfering with a verdict on the basis that it was delivered at 3.55pm on a Friday.” 
         
        
        
       Conclusions on “compromise” arguments 
        
       
     33 In my opinion the circumstances pointed to by the appellant do not demonstrate that a compromise occurred. To conclude that there was a compromise would be speculative. It is true that Gleeson CJ said in R v Heaton that a failure to give directions about an alternative verdict could lead to the risk of a compromise, but a compromise of that kind would not justify a new trial, since on the evidence a properly directed jury would abstain from any compromise. The Crown arguments contend that because there was no inconsistency, there was no compromise; in my opinion there was no evidence of any compromise quite independently of any question of inconsistency. In any event, as will be seen, there was no inconsistency here.  
      
       
        
       Conclusions as to different versions 
        
       
     34 The differences in the versions were not great, and related only to precisely when the knife was produced. It is as possible that Miss Loadsman and Miss Miller misunderstood the complainant as it is that the complainant in fact said different things. Even if she did say different things, that might be less damaging to her general credibility than if she had given an absolutely identical story, to the last detail, on all occasions. By themselves the inconsistencies in the versions do not justify a conclusion that the verdict was unreasonable.  
      
       
        
       Conclusions on inconsistency 
        
       
     35 Whether verdicts are inconsistent or not depends on whether there is some reasonable explanation for them.  
      
       
     36 The acquittal on the count charged did not necessarily flow from a positive belief on the part of the jury that there were no circumstances of aggravation through the use of a knife. That acquittal could have rested equally on the inability of the jury to be satisfied about that beyond a reasonable doubt. 
      
       
     37 So far as the Crown submitted that one possible explanation is that the jury may have concluded that a knife was displayed at some stage, but were not prepared to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was used as part of a threat to inflict actual bodily harm, the submission is not strong. That construction of the complainant’s evidence is possible, but unlikely. 
      
       
     38 The other possible explanation advanced by the Crown is that the jury were prepared to conclude beyond doubt that there was intercourse with the complainant and that it was non-consensual, but not prepared to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a knife, or were unable to agree on when it was displayed. That latter outcome may have been because of the particular circumstances in which the observations of the person attacking the complainant were made – she had just awoken, was dragged from her bed, and the room was dark. It may have been because of the differences between the complainant’s version to Miss Loadsman and Miss Miller (the complainant woke up with a knife at her throat) and the complainant’s version in evidence and to Miss Barrett (the knife was produced later).  
      
       
     39 In R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [79], Spigelman CJ pointed out that while material suggesting a jury finding of dishonesty, or a rejection of the substance of the complainant’s evidence, rather than unpersuasiveness on some point might create a conflict, a jury could accept a complainant as truthful, even if her recollection was faulty in some respects, but not key ones, or even if they were cautious about some of the details but not the substance of the story, or even if they thought part of the complainant’s evidence was exaggerated but she was generally truthful, or even if they found a lack of sufficient particularity as to time, place or circumstance to justify conviction, but believed her generally.  
      
       
     40 In my opinion the appellant has not demonstrated that inherent in the acquittal on the count charged is a finding of dishonesty, or a rejection of the substance of her evidence, or anything more than a doubt about her observation of a knife or recollections about it. The second category of explanation advanced by the Crown is reasonably available. Accordingly there is no inconsistency between the acquittal on the offence charged and the conviction on the alternative charge. The jury’s views of the evidence and of the complainant’s reliability are not internally conflicting. It is undesirable to comment in too much detail on the complainant’s evidence in view of the fact that there is to be a new trial. But there was ample evidence to support a conclusion of non-consent even if the knife evidence was left out of account: the appellant, on the complainant’s evidence, behaved with a considerable degree of physical and verbal violence and encountered the complainant in circumstances calculated to terrify her and overbear her will. While it was open to the jury to accept the appellant’s denials, a choice between the versions was a matter for the jury. The choice actually made has not been demonstrated in this appeal to be unreasonable.  
      
       
     41 For those reasons Ground 1 fails. 
      
       
     42 DOWD J: The appellant, Desmond Jeffrey Currie, appealed against his conviction following a jury trial, on an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (‘the Act’). He was sentenced on 27 April 2001, to imprisonment for five years, commencing on 24 July 2001 and to expire 23 July 2006, with a non-parole period of two year expiring 23 July 2003. The offence carries a penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. 
      
       
     43 The Crown also appealed on the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The decision was reserved. On 13 December 2001, the Court announced its decision, that the conviction be quashed and the Court ordered a new trial on the offence on which he was convicted. The appeal in respect of the sentence was dismissed. The appellant remained in custody as he was serving a balance of parole of two years and one month, expiring on 13 February 2002. Subsequent to that date, appellant applied for and was granted bail by me. 
      
       
     44 I now set out below my reason for Judgment on the appeal. 
      
       
     45 The appellant was indicted before Twigg QC DCJ, at Coffs Harbour District Court, on a count alleging that he, between 20 December 1999 and 22 December 1999, at Grafton, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with Emma Kate Barrett without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time of the offence he did by means of an offensive weapon, threaten to inflict actual bodily harm on Emma Kate Barrett and her children, who were nearby. The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for twenty years. 
      
       
     46 The appellant pleaded not guilty. On 11 August 2000, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, but guilty of the offence referred to in paragraph 1.  
      
       
       Crown Case 
       
     47 The complainant, Barrett, met the appellant in November 1999 when he visited her home in South Grafton on two consecutive nights. In the first of these visits, he knocked on the door and said his name was “Des”, she having seen him previously in the local area. 
      
       
     48 The appellant told the complainant that her friend Daphne had asked him to call around on the complainant, who invited the appellant to join her for a drink, which, together with the removalist, who was assisting her in a move to Sydney, occurred. 
      
       
     49 The complainant subsequently gave the appellant clothes to give to her friend Daphne, and the complainant gave him the complainant’s telephone number so that her friend Daphne could contact her. 
      
       
     50 On the following night, the appellant visited the complainant’s home in the company of a friend, Alan Robinson. He and Robinson left together. The appellant returned alone, and told the complainant that he had left something on the table, and walked into the house. He then made sexual advances towards the complainant, which she rejected, and nothing of a sexual nature occurred. The appellant left. The following day the complainant left South Grafton for Sydney. 
      
       
     51 The complainant returned to the home at South Grafton on 21 December 1999 and went to sleep in the lounge room with her three children. Some time later in the evening, she was awakened, dragged into the bedroom and was dropped on the floor. She screamed for help. She gave evidence at the trial that her attacker produced a knife and told her to “shut up” and if she did, that he would not hurt her or her daughters.  
      
       
     52 The complainant said that in her bedroom there was enough light to see her attacker whom she recognised as the appellant, and that he was mostly wearing black and had a T-shirt tied over the bottom half of his face, and was wearing a black beanie, and that she could see 
      
       
        
         
         “… a bit of scruffy hair out of the sides”. 
         
        
       
     53 The appellant told the complainant to undress and lie on the bed. He had penile vaginal intercourse with her. He told her to turn over to her hands and knees, and had intercourse with her from behind. The complainant said that she told the appellant “No” or “Just don’t”, and that the appellant kept saying to her: 
      
       
        
         
         “Do you want to see me get wild, do you want me to get wild with you, just be quiet”. 
         
        
       
     54 After intercourse, the appellant asked the complainant if she wanted a smoke, and she told him to leave the premises, which he did.  
      
       
     55 After the appellant had left, the complainant found her own black beanie in the bedroom as well as a knife, which was from her kitchen. The complainant moved back to Sydney in January 2000 and threw the beanie into a clothing bin, where other items of unwanted clothing were put. She took the knife and continued to use it as a kitchen knife, later handing it to the police.  
      
       
     56 The complainant’s evidence was that she subsequently found that the locked back door was not working properly, and the door was not locking. She subsequently had the door fixed. 
      
       
     57 The day after the attack, the complainant attended a medical centre in Grafton requesting a “morning after” pill, but did not tell the doctor of the attack. The complainant said she did not tell the doctor because she did not want him to call the police, and she did not want to involve the police because of embarrassment. The doctor’s corroborative statement was admitted in evidence. 
      
       
     58 The complainant told her niece of the rape after the niece noticed the complainant taking the “morning after” pill. The niece’s evidence was that the complainant said that when the complainant awoke, there was a knife at her throat. She also told a friend, Melinda Miller, that she had been raped, and she identified a person, whose name was Des, who had been to her house with the mutual friend Alan Robinson. Miller’s evidence also was that the complainant told her she woke to find the knife at her throat.59 On 9 January 2000, the complainant told her former sister-in-law that someone had broken into her house and raped her, and said that the person’s name was Des. Her sister-in-law told her husband, David Walker, what the complainant had told her, and following a conversation with his cousin, they spoke with a Billy Drew, who, with another man, attended the police station where they spoke to the police about the matter.  
      
       
     60 The sister-in-law’s evidence (Transcript 10/8/2000 at p136, ll 46-54) was that the complainant told her she had been pulled down the hallway, screamed, and that the appellant then had pulled out a knife. 
      
       
     61 An area of staining of the mattress showed a positive presumptive test for semen. The appellant had samples of blood and hair taken from him. His DNA profile was found to be the same as the semen occurring in fewer than one in ten billion persons in the population. 
      
       
     62 The appellant’s wife had been admitted to hospital on the evening of 21 December 2000. The appellant, who had accompanied his wife, returned to his home, but later that evening left the house and was not seen by the appellant’s father until 3:00am the next morning, when the appellant arrived home with a friend. Another witness, Patricia Cole, said that the appellant left her home to go to his home at about 11:00pm.  
      
       
        
       Appellant’s Case at Trial 
        
       
     63 The appellant, in his evidence, denied having sexual intercourse without the complainant’s consent. He said that he left the home of Patricia Cole at about 10:15pm, with the intention of going back to the hospital to see his wife. He said that his car ran out of petrol, and that he pushed the car to a nearby hotel, and that his friend, Mr Bunon, to whose home he then went, gave him a lift home, where Mr Bunon met his father. 
      
       
     64 The appellant said that he met the complainant when he visited with his friend, Freddo, and that they had smoked marijuana, and during that time the complainant had asked him to come back. There was also a truck driver there at the time, and after the truck driver left, he and the complainant ended up in bed, and that he and the complainant had had consensual intercourse, and that he had ejaculated, but not inside the complainant.  
      
       
     65 The appellant alleged that Bill Drew has persuaded the complainant to go to the police because Drew was interested in the appellant’s wife, and Drew saw this as a means of getting rid of the appellant.  
      
       
     66 The appellant’s wife gave evidence that she did not see any bite marks on the appellant; that she would have noticed such marks as she was close to her husband, always touching him and holding his hands. She said that she knew Bill Drew, and that Drew had expressed a romantic interest in her. 
      
       
        
       The Trial 
       
     67 At trial, the jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00am on Friday 11 June 2000, and came back with a question at 11:50am, in which the jury asked whether they could find a verdict of guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, but not guilty of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. After legal argument, the trial judge directed the jury, without any explanation, that the short answer was “yes”. The charge had been brought under s61J of the Act and thus, pursuant to s61Q of the Act, there was available the alternative statutory verdict of sexual assault without consent.  
      
       
     68 The jury’s verdict to guilty of the statutory alternative was at 3:55pm that same day. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
      
       
       (1) The Verdict of Guilty is Inconsistent and Unreasonable 
       
     69 The appellant relies on Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, as considered in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82, as to the duty of an appellate Court to properly seek to reconcile verdicts in cases of multiple counts, where there is an apparent inconsistency. 
      
       
     70 In Markuleski, Wood CJ at CL referred to McKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348, citing the judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at p366: 
      
       
        
         
         “…. where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the original process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and reasonableness ….”.  
         
        
       
     71 The appellant submitted that the verdict of guilty to the statutory alternative of sexual assault without circumstances of aggravation, is not logical and reasonable.  
      
       
     72 The appellant relied on the competing versions of when the knife was produced, in the version she gave to her niece and her friend, to that which she had given to her sister-in-law, that latter being the version, which she gave to the jury on 9 January 2000. This version alleged that the knife was produced in the hallway, after she had screamed. It is put, therefore, for the appellant that the evidence of the fact of what really happened is contradictory and impossible to reconcile, that it, had the knife and threat to the children occurred at the very beginning, in the hallway, or was the knife produced after the dragging, biting and screaming. 
      
       
     73 The appellant puts it that it would be too superficial analysis to say that the will of the complainant was overborn by being woken, dragged down the hall, and dropped in the bedroom. In her oral evidence, the complainant had bitten the assailant with a “full bite”, prior to the production of the knife, enough for him to take his hand off her mouth, and that she had the presence of mind to scream. It is put that this is an indication of capable resistance, and that it was only after the production of the knife and the threat to her children that the resistance subsided. 
      
       
     74 The evidence that the complainant gave to Teena Barrett was that the complainant had screamed a bit, but that he had pulled out the knife, indicating that she had not given up screaming as a mode of coping with the situation. 
      
       
     75 It is put on behalf of the appellant that in McKenzie (supra), the alternative count was in the trial from the commencement, and the parties had had full scope to explore the issues raised on the different counts. 
      
       
     76 The appellant further submitted that although it was a sparsely housed residential area, that there was at least one of the house windows open, and that the complainant was able to scream “help, help” at the top of her voice when she saw the knife, but did not scream thereafter. 
      
       
     77 It is further put, in support of the contention that it is a compromised verdict, that the timing of the verdict at 3:55pm is an indication of possible compromise: R v Robinson (2000) 111 A Crim R 388 at paragraphs 67-68 per Barr J, and that the jury had asked a question before the evidence was concluded, as to whether the complainant had mentioned a knife to Det. King, which she had. In relation to this, I do not think that any inference can be drawn from the timing of the verdict. The jury had most of the afternoon to consider the matter, and the fact that the verdict occurs at a particular time does not of itself give rise to an inference of compromise. 
      
       
     78 In support of the contention that the verdict is unsupportable, the jury appeared to have accepted evidence as to identification, where the evidence of identification was in unsatisfactory circumstances, but did not accept the version of the complainant on another crucial element. It is further put, that in the circumstances of the dim lighting, that identification was not ideal and that there was no line-up in terms of the Evidence Act 1995, although no point is taken as such, to this fact on appeal.  
      
       
     79 It was also submitted by the appellant, that evidence given by the appellant’s wife that she had not seen any bite marks on the appellant, could not be substantiated by the appellant, as the appellant had been deprived of the opportunity to produce prompt medical evidence because of the delay in complaint (Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79). Finally it was put that the contradictory versions do not go to her version of complaint, but represents contradictory evidence of the fact asserted, and if that evidence of the knife is not accepted by the jury, it is unclear as to when the complainant’s will had been overborn. 
      
       
     80 In McKenzie, it was held per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at p367: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not the role of the appellate court to substitute its opinion of the facts upon which one is open to the jury”. 
         
        
       
     81 In M v The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487 at page 493, it was held that: 
      
       
        
         
         “…. the Court must not disregard a discount, either the consideration that they jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the jury must therefore have regard to these considerations”. 
         
        
       
     82 The complainant’s version in evidence-in-chief was maintained by her in cross-examination, and was supported by the witnesses called by her. The DNA evidence supported her case, in that, the semen had the same DNA profile as the appellant. The jury was entitled to reject the appellant’s evidence, particularly in the light of the evidence of the appellant’s father, that the appellant did not get home until about 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning. 
      
       
     83 Identification is an issue for the jury to decide on the evidence before it. This of itself does not make the verdict unreasonable. Similarly any discrepancy in her evidence does not of itself make the verdict unreasonable or unsupportable. This is clearly a jury matter.  
      
       
     84 As a matter of law, there is no inconsistency in the verdict of guilty found by the jury and the verdict of not guilty in the charge under s61J of the Act. The only difference in the jury’s verdict was that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the circumstances of aggravation. 
      
       
     85 It was submitted by he Crown that it is too simplistic to characterise the circumstances of aggravation as merely the possession of a knife or use of a knife, or even threats with regard to a knife. 
      
       
     86 For the Crown to prove the more serious offence, it was necessary to prove the threat to inflict actual bodily harm upon the complainant or her children by means of a knife. 
      
       
     87 The jury may have been satisfied that the appellant held a knife, and that he threatened her or her children, but may have not been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s words amounted to a threat to cause actual bodily harm by means of the knife. 
      
       
     88 It must be remembered that the variation in the corroborative witnesses that I have referred to above, may have caused some doubt as to the circumstances surrounding the knife, without the jury necessarily disbelieving the actual circumstances that gave rise to the finding of guilty on the lesser charge. 
      
       
     89 It can simply be said that the proper interpretation of the jury’s verdict was, that they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had in his possession, a knife, but nevertheless the verdict of guilty was not inconsistent with the finding of not guilty on the aggravated charge. 
      
       
     90 In my view, cumulatively, of all the matters raised collectively as well as individually, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. For the reasons expressed above I do not have a doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
      
       
        
        
        
       (2) The appellant did not receive a fair trial and was denied procedural fairness when the statutory alternative count was left to the jury.  
        
       
     91 The appellant submitted that he was denied any opportunity through his Counsel to make submissions concerning the jury’s question about the lesser offence, as to issues about the presence of the knife, or threats to the children and the overbearing of the will of the complainant. 
      
       
     92 It was put, and in my view, correctly, that the manner in which the alternative count arose, deprived the jury of directions as to how they might access the credibility of the complainant had they entertained a doubt about her reliability, in respect of the one count, and the fact that they may take that doubt into account in assessing the reliability of the complainant in relation to another count.  
      
       
     93 Such a direction was referred to by Spigelman CJ in Markuleski at para 191, when he referred to the proposition that a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant’s evidence on any count ought to be taken into account on the complainant’s credibility generally. 
      
       
     94 It is appreciated that a count which has statutory alternatives create difficulties for Counsel and the Judge to address, as against where there are two counts she specifically pleaded against an accused. It seems to me, that in the circumstances of this case, where the issue was in fact raised as to the ability of the jury to make a finding on the alternative count, there is a need in that point in time for guidance to be given as to how to consider the count separately. This did not occur. 95 In R v Pureau, (1990) 47 A Crim R 230, Hunt J, (as he then was, and with whom Endeby and Sharpe JJ agreed), held to the effect that in reviewing the Learned Trial Judge’s directions, the Trial Judge had given no assistance to the jury as to how the jury were to consider the Crown’s case on the alternative charge, and therefore the conviction must be quashed: (see R v Quinn (Unreported, NSWCCA, 31 July 1991), 
      
       
     96 In R v Heaton, (Unreported, NSWCCA, 1 June 1990), Gleeson CJ also said that there was practically nothing given, by way of instruction to the jury, as to the possible views of the facts of the case that might result in one verdict other than another, and that there was a risk that a jury might find an alternative verdict as a compromise, without really understanding what was involved in the decision. Applying Heaton and Pureau, there being no warning given, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. 
      
       
       (3) The jury did not receive a direction to the effect that, should they have a doubt as to the credit of the complainant on one count they may take that into account in assessing her reliability on the other.  
        
       
     97 It is my view, as indicated in my remarks on ground two, that although the alternative count was not contemplated in the Summing–Up, the question from the jury gave rise to circumstances that then obliged the Court to take into account the doubt as to the complainant’s credit on one count, to be taken into account in assessing her reliability on the other elements of the offence. I consider that this ground is made out and is in part covered by the reasoning in respect of ground two above. This would also justify an order for a new trial. 
      
       
        
        
       (4) The appellant did not receive a fair trial, because of the acceptance into evidence of Exhibit D, the alibi notice, 
        
       
     98 It was considered by the appellant in the hearing that ground four, even if it succeeded, would not justify a new trial, and it is not necessary in light of the findings that I have made on grounds two and three to further discuss this ground. 
      
       
        
       (5) The Learned Trial Judge did not direct the jury that versions of the complainant, given to Fallon Loadsman and Melinda Miller, differing from those given to Teena Barrett and the jury on oath, were to be taken into account in assessing her credibility. 
        
       
     99 In relation to this ground, the findings that I have made and the view that I have taken in ground two and ground three, it is not necessary to elaborate this ground as it is subsumed within the reasons that I have given as to grounds two and three. 
      
       
     100 In the light of the findings that I have made I considered that the appellant was entitled to a new trial, but a new trial limited to the counts on which he had been found guilty as he had already been acquitted on the charge with which he was indicted. 
      
       
     101 WHEALY J:  I agree with the reasons of Heydon JA.

      REGINA v TS 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: TS and Mahmoud Chami together with three others are due to stand trial commencing on Monday 15 April 2002 in respect of an indictment containing 19 counts. TS and Chami each applied to the trial judge, Finnane DCJ, for an order that each be tried separately in respect of the charges brought against them and their applications were refused. Each now seeks leave to appeal against the interlocutory orders made by his Honour refusing those applications. 
      
       
     2 The counts in the indictment relate to several consecutive but separate incidents involving sexual misconduct.  
      
       
     3 The first incident is alleged to have occurred on 30 August 2000 in a car park toilet in Bankstown. The first count in the indictment arises out of the first incident. By the first count, the Crown alleges that, at the car park toilet, TS together with one Mohammed Skaff detained the complainant with intent to hold her for sexual advantage. Two brothers named Sanoussi, who have already pleaded guilty to a similar charge, were also involved in this incident. 
      
       
     4 TS faces a second count arising out of the first incident. The Crown alleges that, on the same date and place, he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, in circumstances of aggravation, being at the time in the company of other male persons. 
      
       
     5 Chami is not said to have been involved in any offence in the course of the first incident. 
      
       
     6 The second incident is alleged to have occurred some hours later in a car in the grounds of a trotting club car park near Bankstown Airport. The Crown alleges that other accused persons, not including TS or Chami, there sexually assaulted the complainant. 
      
       
     7 A third incident involved occurrences on the same day some time later in the same car while it was travelling to an industrial area in Chullora. 
      
       
     8 A fourth incident is alleged to have occurred at the industrial area in Chullora. The Crown alleges that Chami, together with two other accused persons (not including TS), there detained the complainant with intent to hold her for sexual advantage. In addition, the Crown alleges that, at that place, Chami as well as other accused persons (not including TS) had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent in circumstances of aggravation, being at the time in the company of three other male persons. 
      
       
     9 Other accused persons, not including TS or Chami, face similar charges in connection with the third and fourth incidents. 
      
       
     10 A fifth incident took place at the industrial site at Chullora after the applicant Chami is said to have departed from the scene. 
      
       
     11 Finally, two other accused persons, not including TS or Chami, are charged with perverting the course of justice by making false statements to police officers relating to false alibis concerning the earlier incidents. 
      
       
     12 The legal principles to be applied in considering whether a separate trial of co-accused should be ordered are not controversial. In R v Baartman (unreported, NSWCCA 6 October 1994) this court approved the statement by Hunt J in R v Middis (unreported, NSWSC, 27 March 1991) as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Briefly the relevant principles are that (1) where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and (2) where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and (3) where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial."" 
         
        
        
       As Kirby J observed in  
       R v Patsalis  
       (1999) NSWSC 649:  
        
        
         
         ""The touchstone must, of necessity, remain general. Is there a risk of positive injustice to the accused were he or she to stand trial jointly with a co-accused."" 
         
        
       
     13 It also has to be noted that this is an application for leave to appeal against a decision that has already been made to refuse a joint trial. Appellate courts will not readily interfere with what a judge does at an interlocutory stage. Leave to appeal will not readily be granted although, of course, if an appropriate case is made out, showing an error or principle apt to cause irregularity or injustice, then this court will grant leave: R v Van Phu Ho (NSWCA, unreported, 18 July 1994). 
      
       
     14 I turn first to the application by TS.  
      
       
     15 Finnane DCJ dealt with the application for a separate trial on the basis that the charges against TS and Mohammed Skaff should be separated from the remaining charges on the indictment and that a joint trial should proceed separately against those two persons. His Honour did not consider the merits of separating only the charge against TS. This, I think, may well have occurred as a result of the way in which the case was argued before his Honour. The judge noted that counsel for TS accepted that a joint trial between TS and Skaff ""would be a course which he could not really oppose"". I do not agree with that approach and, today, Mr Wasilenia on behalf of TS did not present the case to this court in that way. There is no reason why, if there is to be a separation, the separation should not involve a separate trial against TS alone. 
      
       
     16 In the circumstances, I consider with respect that his Honour fell into error in this regard. This court is therefore required to exercise its own discretion afresh. 
      
       
     17 The central point made by Mr Wasilenia is that while TS was involved in the first incident he was not involved in the others. TS has been joined in an indictment which contains 19 counts, only two of which are in respect of him. None of the evidence that relates to the other 17 counts bears on TS's guilt or otherwise in respect of the two charges he faces. The trial is likely to last some 12 weeks and involve some 70 witnesses. The charges against TS should not take more than two weeks (and could take less) and will involve far fewer witnesses. 
      
       
     18 Essentially, the prejudice that is likely to be suffered by TS were the trial not to be separated falls into two categories. The first, and most serious, is that evidence relating to sexual assaults and other sexual misconduct, inadmissible against him, would be led at the trial.  
      
       
     19 The conduct giving rise to the 19 counts on the indictment can only be described as brutal, cruel, callous and horrifying. The alleged offenders are all, or all but one, from the same ethnic group. The details of the offences are likely to arouse extremely hostile feelings against these persons. The common ethnicity of the offenders could well give rise to generalised feelings of disgust and anger. It is possible that the jury may be influenced by such feelings, brought about by the conduct of all the offenders, when considering their verdict in respect of the counts alleged against TS.  
      
       
     20 It is true that the trial judge would no doubt give very careful and explicit directions warning the jury against allowing any such feelings to affect their judgment. But in the highly charged atmosphere of such a trial where there will be a mass of evidence of these appalling crimes, it may be difficult for a jury, with the best will in the world, to remain entirely objective. In summary, I think that there is a risk of guilt by association. 
      
       
     21 There is no other category of prejudice that concerns the nature and effect of the evidence likely to be led at the trial. Mr Wasilenia did not disclose to us the nature of TS's defence but whatever it may be, the evidence to be led in regards to the seventeen charges unrelated to TS is not likely to concern TS at all, and, hence, is unlikely to impinge directly on whatever defence he might raise. 
      
       
     22 I turn to another category of prejudice that, while relevant, is less important. The trial will be a very long one. As I have said, several weeks of the trial will involve evidence unrelated to TS. It is arguably unfair to require him to bear the vast and unnecessary cost of legal representation that would be required in such a lengthy case when only such a small proportion of it involves the charges faced by him. 
      
       
     23 The Crown contends that TS was factually linked to the other incidents or at least one of them, but none of his conduct of that kind is said to have been criminal in nature and I do not think that the links, such as they are, are of particular importance. 
      
       
     24 To be weighed against this prejudice likely to be suffered by TS is the prejudice to the Crown witnesses who, if the trial is separated, will have to testify on two occasions in relation to the first incident. In particular, this is a matter of serious concern regarding the complainant. She will no doubt find testifying and reliving the incidents giving rise to the alleged offences, a most painful experience. To have to undergo that on two occasions, albeit that the second occasion will be far more limited, will be harrowing indeed. In addition, there will be many other witnesses who will have to testify twice and this will give rise to considerable expense and inconvenience. Furthermore, due regard must be given to the important general principle that persons involved in related or connected crimes should be tried together: R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543.  
      
       
     25 The exercise of weighing up such interests was carried out in R v Oliver (see at 547), R v Dellapatrona & Duffield (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 (see at 133-134); see also R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at para 212 and R v Middis (where Hunt J said that he had “balanced the prejudice to the accused against [the] public interest”). The result of such an exercise must, of course, depend on the particular circumstances of each case. 
      
       
     26 I am fully cognisant of the trauma the complainant is likely to have to endure should she be required to testify twice. I also bear in mind the cost and expense of two trials.  
      
       
     27 Nevertheless, it seems to me, the issue regarding TS, when stripped of irrelevancies and fallacious tactical arguments, comes down simply to a balancing exercise between, on the one hand, the potential prejudice to TS in being associated with persons who perpetrated these monstrous crimes (and having to bear several weeks of unnecessary legal costs) and, on the other, the public interest in having all the accused persons face trial together, taking into account the suffering and inconvenience and costs that will result from witnesses having to testify twice. 
      
       
     28 In my view, in the particular circumstances relating to TS, when the test is put so starkly, the liberty of the subject must prevail.  
      
       
     29 I would therefore grant the application for leave to appeal, uphold the appeal and order that the trial of TS in respect of the two counts he presently faces be severed from the indictment and there be a separate trial as regards the offences with which he is charged. 
      
       
     30 I turn now to the application by Chami. 
      
       
     31 Chami stands in a different position to TS. Unlike the case against TS, the offences against Chami arose out of the fourth incident. Moreover, Chami's defence to the counts faced by him is that the complainant consented to sexual intercourse. This means, inevitably, that the Crown will be entitled to lead evidence of the earlier incidents. It would be entirely inappropriate for the complainant to commence her story with what occurred at Chullora as this would give a false picture of her state of mind and the position she was in. Moreover, the history of the assaults committed on her during the course of the earlier incidents and the vulnerable position she came to be in would be relevant to the question of her alleged consent to intercourse with Chami. The Crown would be entitled to lead evidence of what occurred in the earlier incidents in order to rebut Chami's defence of consent. 
      
       
     32 Finnane DCJ said in regard to these matters: 
      
       
        
         
         “If I were to separate the trials, the Crown would seek to call evidence, possibly from all those involved in the other incidents. And in my opinion, and the facts as I presently know them, the Crown, if it called these people, even against objection, would be likely to be permitted by me to call them, and certainly to call the applicant to rebut any suggestion that she was a willing party in this third incident.” 
         
        
        
       I consider these remarks to be entirely correct. 
        
       
     33 As the evidence of the earlier incidents will, in any event, be admissible against Chami, the powerful considerations involving avoidable inferences of guilt by association and additional cost and inconvenience that I regarded as being of paramount importance in the case of TS do not apply to Chami. 
      
       
     34 In the circumstances, I am not persuaded, in relation to Chami, that the decision by Finnane DCJ is wrong. I would dismiss the application for leave to appeal by Chami. 
      
       
     35 SULLY J: So far as the application by Chami for leave to appeal is concerned, I respectfully agree with the learned presiding Judge. I do not need to add anything to what has fallen from his Honour in connection with either the relevant law or the relevant facts. 
      
       
     36 So far as concerns the application for leave by TS, I regret to say that I have come to a conclusion contrary to that reached by his Honour the presiding Judge. 
      
       
     37 I accept of course that the decisions in Middis and Baartman to which his Honour has referred may be taken as stating in the aggregate the basic principles now relevant. I draw attention, in connection with the decision in Middis, to the proposition advanced by Mr Justice Hunt that ""the applicant must show a positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial"". There are several things to be said about that statement. The first is that it conveys the proposition that there is imposed upon the applicant for a severed trial a burden of proof of real substance. That is a burden which is directed, not at what might be known in other jurisdictions as the balance of convenience, but at the very different proposition that a severed trial if it is to be justified at all, must be justified by ""positive injustice"". 
      
       
     38 To my mind, what is conveyed by Mr Justice Hunt's proposition is that the applicant to sever a trial undertakes no light burden. It is the fixed position of the common law, at least as I apprehend it, that people who are charged as co-offenders in connection with what might be understood reasonably as a fairly unbroken continuum of serious crime, are ordinarily and properly to be tried together. There are fundamental propositions of public policy, as I respectfully apprehend the relevant stance of the law, that underpin and explain that approach. 
      
       
     39 It is convenient to refer to some observations of McHugh J in a comparatively recent judgment of the High Court: Gilbert v The Queen 170 ALR 88 at pp 96 and 97. 
      
       
     40 The passages are short passages, and I trust that it will not be thought untoward of me if I take a moment to read them in order that those who are listening to what is being said will get at least the general sense of what it is that I take from the decision. 
      
       
     41 Gilbert was convicted by a jury of murder. It was contended for him on his appeal to the High Court of Australia that the trial Judge had erred in not leaving to the jury the possible alternate verdict of manslaughter. One of the arguments put for the appellant appears to have been that if manslaughter had been left as an issue, the jury might well have convicted him of manslaughter, notwithstanding that their verdict necessarily showed that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ""facts"" upon which the ""defence"" of manslaughter depended were not true. Mr Justice McHugh expresses the view, as his Honour puts it, ""that this argument should be rejected as a matter of legal policy as well as legal principle and established authority"". There then follows the statements which seem to me to be of particular relevance for the purposes of the present application. Those statements are as follows. 
      
       
        
         
         ""The argument for the appellant is a claim that this court should proceed on one of two bases, each of which necessarily involves an assumption that, if manslaughter had been left as an issue, the jury might have disregarded their sworn duty to give a verdict in accordance with the evidence. The first assumption is that, if manslaughter had been left, the jury might have convicted of manslaughter even though they knew, because of the trial judge's directions, that the appellant was guilty of murder. The second assumption is that the jurors were not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that his brother intended to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm on (the victim), that they knew therefore that he was not guilty of murder, but that they nevertheless convicted him of murder rather than acquit him and see him go free. In my respectful opinion, as a matter of legal policy, no court of justice can entertain either assumption. 
         
        
        
         
         The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was now rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials."" 
         
        
       
     42 I am in respectful and complete agreement with those propositions put by his Honour. I have quoted them at such length because fundamental to the present application is, precisely, the proposition that the jury at the proposed joint trial, if properly directed by the presiding Judge as to the relevant principles of law, cannot be trusted, to put the matter plainly, to then act reasonably, and in accordance with the directions of law that they will have thus been given. 
      
       
     43 For myself, I would never lightly accept that such an inference was to be drawn about the likely course of any trial by jury. As I understand the comments stated with such authority by McHugh J, in my respectful opinion they are entirely correct in principle and are relevant in connection with the present application. 
      
       
     44 The next thing that I would observe about the present application is based upon the celebrated statement of Mr Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, as he subsequently was, that the life of the law has not been logic, but experience. It would be entirely naïve, in my respectful view, not to understand that there lies behind most, if not perhaps literally all, applications for separate trials, not only a concern with high matters of legal philosophy and principle, but hard, cold, strategic calculations and tactical calculations in connection with the presentation, with the maximum tactical and strategic advantage, of the trial which it is proposed should be severed. 
      
       
     45 The present case furnishes, I think, a very good example of the possibilities that are open in that regard. I imagine that if the Court were to sever the trial of TS, it could be expected reasonably that the trial of the remaining co-accused would thereupon proceed, TS's trial being set aside until it was known what had happened in the cases of the other offenders. That, of course, puts TS, not in the position where he is able to avoid positive injustice, so much as in a position where, depending of course upon how the putative joint trial had turned out, he might be able to procure in substance no less positive an injustice by avoiding a verdict which was in a true sense not representative of where he really stood in the scheme of things, once that entire scheme had been looked at as a whole. [I would presume from what the learned presiding Judge said as a ""valuations tactical argument"". I regard it as a proposition of established practice in the criminal courts of this State.] [JUDGE'S NOTE: The material in brackets makes, obviously, no sense. The judgment was delivered ex tempore and not from prepared notes. It is impossible to reproduce from unaided recollection what was actually said] I would for myself never lightly encourage that view or that approach to matters of the seriousness of the present matters. 
      
       
     46 It seems to me that before one could say with proper confidence that the applicant had shown that ""positive injustice"" could result we should look at of the need to know with precision, which I at least do not perceive in the material before the Court, first, what exactly in the end the complainant will say about the applicant; secondly, what in particular the applicant will say about the complainant; thirdly, what in particular other people concerned, in particular other co-accused, will say either about the applicant or about the complainant. These are not artificial considerations. They are the bones and sinew of the practical conduct of the trial of the kind that is proposed to commence next Monday. 
      
       
     47 It seems to me that the party bearing the onus of proof, that is to say the applicant in the present case, needs to demonstrate in a real, practical, positive way some such conjunction of facts and circumstances as to those three matters of which I have spoken, as to justify a reasonable mind in drawing the inference that there is indeed demonstrated ""positive injustice"" in the sense which I apprehend to have been intended by Mr Justice Hunt in his Honour's judgment from which I have been quoting. 
      
       
     48 I agree, and for the reasons given by the learned presiding Judge, that it is possible to make a case, and a not unpersuasive case, based upon mere convenience; but that does not seem to me to be relevant in a case such as the present kind. It has been stated repeatedly by Courts is that an accused is not entitled to a fair trial in some vague and abstract sense. He is entitled to a fair trial according to law, that being said in the sense that in the world of human affairs the law, like everything else, cannot be expected to be absolutely ideal and absolutely perfect in all circumstances and at all times. 
      
       
     49 I am not at all persuaded that, if the present applicant is presented in a joint trial such as is proposed, he cannot receive a fair trial according to law. 
      
       
     50 For those reasons and with all proper deference to his Honour, I cannot join his Honour in the order that he proposes in relation to the application of TS. That application, too, I would refuse. 
      
       
     51 BELL J: In respect of the applications I agree with the reasons of the presiding judge and with the orders of the presiding judge. 
      
       
     52 IPP AJA: The order of the court will be as I have indicated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Nathan Anthony Dixon Kerr has pleaded not guilty to the charge that on 5 February 2001 at Kogarah he murdered Michelle Miller. He has elected for trial by judge alone and the Crown has consented to that form of trial. I shall explain when I review the psychiatric evidence why I think it appropriate that the accused be tried without a jury.2 The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts which constitute the offence but he admits all the facts relied on, so there is no doubt about those matters. The accused contends that he is not guilty of the offence because at the time of the events giving rise to the charge he was mentally ill and therefore not legally responsible for his actions. He must prove that it is more likely than not that that was so.3 The statement of the test for a defence of mental illness was propounded as long ago as 1843 in R v McNaghten. The question to be answered was whether the accused at the time the offence was committed was suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, so as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The law has been amplified in Australia in the present century and the test may be said to be whether the accused was able to appreciate the wrongness of the act that he was doing. If through disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. It may also be said that if a disease of the mind so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of an act, the actor is prevented from knowing that what he does is wrong. 
     
      
    4 The accused was born on 23 February 1980. Although he was not formally adopted until he was fifteen years old, he lived with his adoptive parents on and off from birth until he was two and a half years old and permanently after that. His natural mother had a history of schizophrenia and both natural parents were apparently addicted to the use of illegal drugs. 
     
      
    5 At the age of fifteen or sixteen the accused returned to live for some months with his natural parents. At about sixteen or seventeen he began smoking cannabis and reported that it made him “paranoid” and feel “weird”. He cut down his use of the drug. However, he used other illegal drugs. He experimented with LSD and for a period of three months at age seventeen used heroin. He has used it occasionally since then. During the years immediately before the events giving rise to the charge his main drug of abuse was amphetamine. He had binges of three to five days of continuous use with little sleep. He was already experiencing the hallucinations of voices speaking to him, and became aware that the drug was exacerbating them. The voices urged him to attempt suicide and he experienced what he described as “ dark thoughts”. 
     
      
    6 He had no friends at school and got on with only a few teachers. He left before the end of year eleven. His longest employment has been for eight months at McDonalds. His other jobs have been unskilled or semi-skilled.  
     
      
    7 The accused appears to have tried a number of times to come to grips with his drug problem. He told Dr. Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist who has advised the prosecution in this matter, that he had attended several drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres, including eighteen months at the William Booth Institute, a program conducted by the Salvation Army. 
     
      
    8 During 2000 he was at Foster House, a refuge conducted by the Salvation Army, and saw Dr. Babidge at the psychiatric clinic there. Dr. Babidge told him that he was mentally ill and recommended that he take anti-psychotic drugs. The accused declined to be treated.  
     
      
    9 In 2000 he participated in a youth development program at an institution called Triple Care Farm. During the period of his participation, between October and December 2000 he was seen by Dr. Collingridge. She observed that he had periods of erratic thought processes and that he could become agitated and verbally aggressive. She thought he exhibited obvious thought disorder and delusions of control. He was discharged from the program on 13 December 2000, still exhibiting thought disorder and intrusive behaviour. However, he told Dr. Collingridge that he accepted her advice and agreed to take an anti-psychotic drug, Risperidone.  
     
      
    10 Those conducting the program helped the accused to find a flat to occupy at Kogarah. He moved into the flat in December 2000. Another participant in the program, a young woman who was also suffering from a psychiatric illness, moved into the flat with him. 
     
      
    11 On 29 January 2001 the accused got in touch with the Mental Health Service at St. George hospital, Kogarah. He said that he had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and would like a further assessment. He reported problems with clarity of thinking, problems in interpersonal relationships and social contacts and long-standing feelings of depression. He described long-standing thoughts of suicide but denied any contemporary intention of committing suicide. He also described homicidal thoughts though he denied that he had any particular intention to kill anyone. It was apparent that he had not been taking the Risperidone that had been prescribed for him. He made an appointment to attend for an assessment on 2 February 2001. 
     
      
    12 Sadly, he did not keep the appointment.  
     
      
    13 At about 3:00am on Monday 5 February 2001 the accused engaged the services of the deceased, Ms Michelle Miller, a sex worker in Kings Cross. They took a taxi to the accused’s flat. According to what the accused told Dr. Nielssen the accused had inhaled amphetamine during the evening before these events. He and Ms Miller entered the flat and both inhaled amphetamine. There is no suggestion that the accused had previously met Ms Miller or that he had any reason to do her harm. 
     
      
    14 He felt, according to what he told Dr. Nielssen, “really paranoid”. He thought that Ms Miller was sent by Satan to get him killed. That, apparently, was a special message from God. He took a heavy torch and hit Ms Miller repeatedly about the head. The attack resulted in numerous lacerations to the scalp and accompanying comminuted skull fractures. There was a depressed fracture in the left temporal region. Subarachnoid and subdural haemorrhages resulted and they were the principal injuries which caused Ms Miller’s death. The accused also took a large carving knife and stabbed Ms Miller twice. The first wound was in the central abdomen and was at least 160 millimetres deep. The second wound was to the left back and was about 60 millimetres long. It penetrated the ribs and entered the lower part of the left lung. The stab wounds, however, were probably inflicted as Ms Miller was dying or after she was dead.  
     
      
    15 The accused ran away and stayed away from the flat because he found it “too scary” to return. He thought that there were ghosts there. 
     
      
    16 The accused was arrested on 15 February 2001 and kept in custody. He was referred for admission to the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital and assessed there. He was administered the drugs he had been in need of. For a year now he has been the subject of a supervised, controlled regime of treatment. 
     
      
    17 For the purposes of the trial the accused was interviewed by Dr. Nielssen and by a psychiatrist qualified on behalf of the defence, Dr. Westmore. Both agree that although the accused was severely mentally ill when he killed Ms Miller and at the time of his arrest, he has benefited from the treatment administered to him so that he now understands the nature of the trial process and has the capacity to make important decisions about the conduct of his trial. I am accordingly satisfied that when the accused elected for trial by judge alone he had the mental capacity to do so.  
     
      
    18 The accused gave Dr. Westmore an account of the killing in much the same terms as those I have used in this judgment. He said that he believed at the time that Ms Miller intended to kill him because he had something special to offer the world. Dr. Westmore noted the history of drug use and that from his teenage years the accused had been receiving messages from the television and the radio. He noted the schizophrenia of the accused’s natural mother. He noted the accused’s difficult school and work history. He is of the view that the accused was probably suffering from acute schizophrenia when he killed Ms Miller. He thinks that the accused developed delusional beliefs towards her and acted aggressively towards her as a result of those delusional beliefs.  
     
      
    19 Dr Westmore is of the opinion that the most likely diagnosis is one of primary process schizophrenic illness aggravated by illicit drug use. The accused was suffering from that disease of the mind when he killed Ms Miller. It totally deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act and that the act was wrong. His illness resulted in defective reasoning. 
     
      
    20 Dr. Nielssen noted the teenage history of school and work difficulties and developing symptoms as well as of drug abuse. He noted the very high dose of an atypical anti-psychotic drug which had been administered to the accused upon his reception into the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital. He concluded that when he killed the deceased the accused was acutely mentally ill, having developed an underlying schizophrenic illness characterised by abnormal moods, disorganised thinking, thought interference, hallucinations and delusional beliefs. He observed that the accused had a predisposition to become mentally ill and that amphetamines are known to induce acute exacerbations of mental illness in people having such a predisposition. He thought that amphetamine intoxication was likely to have increased the accused’s predisposition to act in an aggressive way.  
     
      
    21 However, Dr. Nielssen’s opinion is that the main reason for the accused’s abnormality of mind at the time of the offence was an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. He thinks that the accused is likely to have experienced the abnormal arousal and disorganised thinking that are associated with acute episodes of mental illness, which affected his ability to reason with any composure or to realise at the time of the events that his behaviour was morally wrong.  
     
      
    22 In my opinion the accused has proved on this material that at the time of the events giving rise to the charge of murder he was mentally ill and has the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness available to him. He must therefore be found not guilty. 
     
      
    23 It is necessary to say a number of other things, however. The events giving rise to the charge have been distressing and perplexing for all those who have been touched by them, including the family of the accused himself. The sympathy of the Court goes out to all those so affected.24 The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990. A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 
     
      
    25 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body of professional experts. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the case of the accused. When it has done its review the Tribunal will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation may be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it may make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation that will be considered by the Department of Health which in turn will advise the Governor-in-Council. The Governor-in-Council will then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council may only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself has recommended release. Assuming that no recommendation for release is made after the first hearing the Mental Health Review Tribunal can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused. 
     
      
    26 After hearing the evidence at any later review, it must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal is not free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. Again following such a review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department of Health and the Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be carried into effect only by order of the Governor-in-Council. 
     
      
    27 If the accused were at any time released back into the community on conditions and there were a breach of any of those conditions, the Governor-in-Council might order that the accused be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if a person were released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case with the assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available. In other words, if a person is released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a watch over him and a breach of any condition will lead to his being apprehended and detained once again. 
     
      
    28 The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients. 
     
      
    29 The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally released by the Governor-in-Council, or is released upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that his release should become unconditional. If that time expires, then his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient. However, as I have previously explained, the accused will never be released unless the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.30 I find that the accused is not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness. I order that he be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

       FACTS 
        
       V, the appellant, had been found guilty of two counts of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He sought leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence by challenging the 2-step reasoning process adopted by the trial judge.  
        
        
       HELD 
        
       Per Meagher JA (Wood CJ at CL & Bell J agreeing) 
        
       (i) The weight of authority required the trial judge to apply the 2-step test in the manner undertaken:  
       Bell v R 
        (1985) 2 NSWLR 466;  
       Garforth  
       (Unreported CCA NSW 23 May 1994);

       Harris 
        (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. 
        
       (ii) The argument advanced against the sentences imposed, and in particular, the claim to make an “instinctive synthesis” ( 
       Bell v R  
       (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 Per Street CJ) is largely semantic and should therefore be rejected. 
        
        
       ORDERS 
        
       (i) Grant leave to appeal.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: This is an application for leave to appeal by Mr Valera who stood trial in Wollongong charged with two counts of murder to which, upon the presentation by the indictment on 12 July 2000, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. Those pleas were not accepted by the Crown and the trial on the murder counts proceeded. On 8 August 2000 the jury found him guilty as charged on both counts, so that he was convicted of the murder of a Mr D J O’Hearn on 12 June 1998 and of the murder of a Mr F N Arkell on 26 June 1998, a fortnight later. His Honour sentenced him to prison for life, as he was entitled – and, in my opinion, obliged, - to do. 
      
       
     2 Using language as restrained as possible, I find the circumstances of each murder disgusting. His Honour’s description of the murder of Mr O’Hearn is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The body of the deceased was found to be decapitated and the head had been deposited in the kitchen sink. The body was otherwise mutilated: the left hand was severed and it was found resting on a sofa in the lounge room; there were deep incisions to the abdomen, and wounding extended from just above the sternum down to the mid point of the abdomen. Dr Cala, who conducted the post mortem examination, observed five intersecting and parallel incised wounds on the lower chest affecting both right and left sides and the wounding of the abdomen exposed the shaft of a hammer which had been inserted through the anus. The head of this hammer was visible between the buttocks of the deceased and the deceased was lying with his jeans and underpants lowered to a point about the knees. The deceased’s penis had been mutilated and intestinal material had been disturbed. Indeed, near the foot of the deceased was found a silver coloured tray on which a section of bowel was resting. On the breakfast bar in the kitchen a number of sections of intestine were found lying.” 
         
        
        
       His description of Mr Arkell’s murder is as follows: 
        
        
         
         “The body of the deceased was found lying on the floor beside the bed in the granny flat. The crime scene evidenced that this victim had been the subject of a savage attack. The deceased was found lying on his back with his legs outstretched, wearing tracksuit pants and a white singlet. The face of the deceased was heavily bloodstained and his head had been very extensively traumatised and was resting in a large pool of blood. Three tie pins had been placed in his person, one in the left cheek, one in the corner of the left eye and one in the right eyelid and there was a splinter of timber found on post mortem examination to have been embedded in the neck of the deceased. This plainly enough had broken off a timber peg, most of which was found on the bed. There was a leather belt lying partially around the neck of the deceased as well as the electrical cord of a lamp. Beside the bed was a broken timber lamp stand, which the evidence revealed had been used to attack the head of the deceased. Also used in the attack was a glass ashtray.” 
         
        
       
     3 Mr Valera does not appeal against conviction. He has restricted his case to an application to appeal against severity of sentence. 
      
       
     4 His Honour concluded his remarks on sentencing with the following words: 
      
       
        
         
         “The level of heinousness involved in these two killings does not allow for the imposition of anything less than imprisonment for life.” 
         
        
       
     5 It is a sufficiently fair analysis of his Honour’s reasoning to say that he reached his conclusion by way of a 2-step process. First, he considered the objective features of each crime, and came to the conclusion that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence. It is hardly necessary to elaborate on the process of reasoning which led him to that conclusion. 
      
       
     6 He then turned his attention to the subjective features of the case, to ascertain whether any discount should be allowed to modify his conclusion. They were these: that Mr Valera was very young, less than 20 years in fact; that he had had a miserable early life, his father bashing him regularly and with great brutality; that, instead of waiting to be arrested, he gave himself up, and thereafter co-operated with the police; and that he had no prior convictions. Contrition, however, was expressly negatived by His Honour. There was no provocation: nor was there any element of mental impairment. On balance, his Honour came to the conclusion that none of these factors required the sentence to be less than life imprisonment. 
      
       
     7 The submission put by Mr Haesler, with his usual ability, in that it is incorrect to approach the sentencing task by first assessing the objective gravity of the offence without regard to subjective features and then – but only then – considering the subjective features in mitigation. This 2-step approach has its genesis in the judgments of Samuels JA and Lee J in Bell v R (1985) 2 NSWLR 466. It has constantly been followed: see, for example, Garforth (unreported CCA NSW 23 May 1994), Twala (unreported CCA NSW 4 November 1994), Fernando [1999] NSW CCA 66 and Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409. An application for leave to appeal in Harris has now been refused by the High Court. Authority to the contrary is confined to the dissenting judgment of Street CJ in Bell. 
      
       
     8 In my view, his Honour was correct in applying a 2-step test. And this for two reasons. First, because the weight of authority (which I have recited) required him to do just that. The second is that the only possible alternative – that advocated by Street CJ in Bell – is to make an “instinctive synthesis”, which will lead to exactly the same result. Provided you take into account all relevant factors, it does not matter in which order you take them. 
      
       
     9 Thus, the argument advanced against the sentences, imposed by Studdert J, seem to me largely semantic and should therefore be rejected. Indeed, one might be tempted to suggest that the circumstances of the present case call for a punishment a good deal more severe than mere life imprisonment. 
      
       
     10 The application should be dismissed. 
      
       
     11 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read in draft the judgment of Meagher JA, and agree with it, save that I would resist the temptation to consider whether the case might have called for any more severe punishment than that imposed. 
      
       
     12 The circumstances in which the offences were committed, their objective seriousness, and the absence of any subjective or other circumstances which might have operated in mitigation of sentence were spelled out by Studdert J with clarity, and without any hint of error. I cannot usefully add to those reasons. 
      
       
     13 The single point which might have attracted our attention depended upon whether the High Court decided in Harris v The Queen that some approach different from that taken by his Honour was required. Special leave has been refused, and I am unpersuaded that the approach first enunciated in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466, and consistently applied thereafter, is erroneous. 
      
       
     14 Irrespective of that consideration, I am similarly unpersuaded that an instinctive synthesis would have led to sentences for lesser terms. 
      
       
     15 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     16 BELL J: I agree with Meagher JA’s reasons for rejecting the challenge to the two-step approach adopted by the sentencing judge. I also agree with the remarks of Wood CJ at CL in his concurring judgment. I, too, would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
      
       
     2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Louise Jane Chapman, was tried by judge alone in the Armidale District Court upon an indictment containing two counts: firstly, deemed supply of methylamphetamine (s 25(1) and s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) and, secondly, supplying amphetamine on an ongoing basis during the first fortnight of October 1999 (s 25A(1) of the Act). The learned trial judge acquitted her of the first count but found her guilty of the second. He sentenced her to imprisonment for eighteen months, to date from 23 March 2001, with a non parole period of eight months. That non parole period had expired at the time this appeal came on for hearing. She appeals against conviction only. Before us, both parties were represented by counsel other than those who had appeared at the trial. 
      
       
        
       The trial 
        
       
     3 There was direct evidence of the second count in the testimony of Dean McDonald. He said that the appellant supplied him with amphetamine at her home on nine or ten occasions in the first half of October 1999. For the most part he paid cash but towards the end of that period he bought the drug on credit, owing the appellant about $200. 
      
       
     4 Mr McDonald was living at the time with Monique Martijn. She gave evidence that on 15 October 1999 the appellant came to their home, looking for Mr McDonald and saying that he owed her money. Mr McDonald was not there at the time. According to Ms Martijn, the appellant went to his room, took some items belonging to him, and left the house. Ms Martijn later observed that Mr McDonald’s filofax was missing, although she did not see the appellant take it. In the small hours of the following morning, she said, two men carrying baseball bats came to the house, also looking for Mr McDonald. 
      
       
     5 According to Mr McDonald, these events persuaded him to go to the police, to whom he revealed his amphetamine use and claimed that the appellant had been his supplier. On 17 October 1999 police executed a search warrant at the appellant’s home, where they found Mr McDonald’s filofax. It was the Crown case that the appellant told police that the filofax was hers. Also found in the appellant’s bedroom was a wooden box which contained a number of items, including a quantity of white powder in a plastic resealable bag. Mr McDonald gave evidence that, when the appellant supplied him with amphetamine, she obtained it from an old tobacco tin kept in a wooden box in her bedroom. 
      
       
     6 The white powder was found upon analysis to contain methylamphetamine, and it was the subject of the first charge (deemed supply). Also found were syringes, swabs, plastic resealable bags, a calculator and two sets of scales. 
      
       
     7 Mr McDonald also gave evidence that he had been introduced to the appellant as a supplier by a mutual friend of theirs, Kelly Brown. Ms Brown was called in the defence case to deny this, and it was something that occurred in the course of her evidence which gives rise to the first ground of appeal. To this I shall return. 
      
       
     8 The appellant gave evidence, denying that she sold amphetamine to Mr McDonald or, indeed, to anyone. She said that she had met Mr McDonald through Ms Brown, but the introduction had not been for the purpose of her supplying him with drugs. She agreed that she had gone to his home on 15 October 1999, but she said that it was for the purpose of recovering money which Mr McDonald owed to her boyfriend, Douglas Knight, for computer games. She denied taking anything from the house, and could not explain how Mr McDonald’s filofax came to be in her bedroom. 
      
       
     9 She had driven to Mr McDonald’s home on that occasion in the company of Douglas Knight and another young man, Samuel Zeller. Both of them gave evidence which supported her account of the reason for the visit. 
      
       
     10 The appellant admitted having been a heavy user of amphetamine at the relevant time. She was a university student, working part time and doing her best to raise two children. She said that she was trying “to be superwoman”, and started using the drug in 1999 to help her stay awake and cope with her various commitments. By August of that year, she said, her drug use was out of control. To reduce the expense of it, she would buy it in bulk and divide it into daily doses. This was her explanation for her possession of articles such as scales and plastic bags, commonly associated with the supply of drugs. 
      
       
     11 As I have said, his Honour acquitted the appellant of the first count. His reasons for doing so are not relevant for present purposes. It is sufficient to say that he was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she was in possession of the drug found by the police for her own use, rather than for supply.  
      
       
     12 His Honour recognised that Dean McDonald was the principal witness in the Crown case. He recognised the need for careful scrutiny of the evidence of Mr McDonald, which he found unsatisfactory in some respects. Equally, he questioned the reliability of Ms Martijn’s recollection of the events of 15 October 1999. However, he considered the finding of the filofax to be “compelling evidence” in support of the account of both of them, and he found further support for the evidence of Mr McDonald in the finding of the wooden box. It was in the light of this corroborative material that his Honour found the second charge made out.  
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
     13 As I have said, Kelly Brown was called in the defence case to deny that she had introduced Mr McDonald to the appellant for the purpose of his being supplied with drugs. At the end of her examination in chief, defence counsel asked her what was her opinion of the appellant. That question was objected to. Asked how it was relevant, counsel said that it went to the appellant’s character. The Crown prosecutor pressed his objection upon the basis that it went to credibility only and was prohibited by s 102 of the Evidence Act. His Honour rejected the evidence. 
      
       
     14 In an affidavit filed in this Court, trial counsel explained that he wished to lead from Ms Brown that, in the light of her association with the appellant, she did not believe that she was a person who would be involved in the supply of drugs. Whether or not it would have been admissible in precisely that form, it is clear that counsel sought to lead favourable evidence about the appellant’s character in accordance with s 110 of the Evidence Act. The Crown prosecutor in this Court acknowledged as much and conceded that the question should have been allowed. (In fairness to his Honour and the Crown prosecutor at trial, it may be that they misunderstood what defence counsel was putting in argument because of something which occurred in the course of the evidence of an earlier witness. However, it is unnecessary to elaborate upon this.) 
      
       
     15 It is the rejection of this evidence which gives rise to the first ground of appeal. A second ground, added by leave at the hearing, asserts a miscarriage of justice resulting from the failure of trial counsel to adduce evidence that the appellant had no prior convictions. In his affidavit, counsel frankly acknowledged that his failure to do so was an oversight.  
      
       
     16 The Crown prosecutor in this Court, whilst acknowledging that the first ground of appeal was made out, made no concession about the second. His only submission was that, in the circumstances of the case, the absence of evidence of the appellant’s good character occasioned no miscarriage of justice, so that the second ground was not made out and the proviso should be applied to the first. He argued that there was a strong Crown case, particularly in the light of the corroborative evidence to which I have referred, and that the effect of any character evidence would have been negated by the appellant’s own admission of her drug abuse: an admission that, even though she had no criminal record, she had in fact been a persistent offender to that extent.  
      
       
     17 I can see the force of both those submissions, and it must be said that trial counsel’s affidavit does not elaborate upon the nature of the character evidence which Ms Brown might have given. On the other hand, while it is true that the finding of the filofax and the wooden box added considerably to the strength of the Crown case, the evidence of Mr McDonald and Ms Martijn suffered from the deficiencies identified by his Honour and, in important respects, the appellant’s account had the support of the evidence of Ms Brown and the two men who accompanied her to Mr McDonald’s home on 15 October. In these circumstances, evidence of the appellant’s good character may well have been of significance.  
      
       
     18 In argument upon the second ground of appeal, neither counsel dealt with the circumstances in which an omission by counsel at trial might amount to a miscarriage of justice and it is unnecessary to revisit that issue. Submissions centred in a practical way upon the question whether, as the result of the absence of evidence of good character generally, the appellant had lost a fair chance of acquittal: cf Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493, per Fullagar J at 514. In my view, this appellant did. As senior counsel appearing for her pointed out, there is a marked distinction between a user of drugs and a supplier of them (whilst acknowledging that many users are, by force of circumstances, also suppliers.) The appellant was almost forty one years old at the time of these events. In the light of the circumstances giving rise to her use of illicit drugs, evidence that she was otherwise of good character might have been sufficient to create a reasonable doubt about her guilt. 
      
       
     19 I would allow the appeal. The question of the consequential order which should be made has troubled me. Ordinarily, the appropriate course would be to order a new trial, given that there is a substantial case against the appellant. However, she has now served the whole of her non parole period and a little over two thirds of her head sentence. In those circumstances, I would propose that verdict and judgment of acquittal on the second count be entered.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MASON P: The appellant was tried in the District Court before Judge Twigg QC and a jury. The indictment contained several charges. The first was a charge that on 22 June 2000, she supplied a prohibited drug, cannabis leaf. The second was that between 21 June 2000 and 12 July 2000 there was an ongoing supply of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine. (There were alternative counts to the second.) The third was that on 11 July 2000 she supplied a prohibited drug, being a charge of deemed supply in relation to methylamphetamine. She was found not guilty on the first charge, and found guilty on the second and third. In consequence, the alternative counts did not proceed to a verdict. 
      
       
     2 The second count being the one on which she was first found guilty, arises under s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which makes it an offence for a person on three or more separate occasions, during any period of 30 consecutive days, to supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, for financial or material reward. 
      
       
     3 The Crown case was a very strong one. There was evidence of controlled undercover drug operations, in which two undercover police officers, using assumed names, participated in controlled purchases from the appellant. 
      
       
     4 The first series of events took place on 22 June 2000 and they involved a controlled purchase of a quantity of cannabis and of amphetamines. It would appear however, that that was a transaction which the jury were not satisfied was proven, because the cannabis part of it was the subject of the first count on which the appellant was acquitted, and because there seems to be no reason to distinguish between the alleged supply of the cannabis, and that of methylamphetamine said to have occurred on that occasion. 
      
       
     5 There were however, three other transactions which were the subject of the s 25A(1) offence, and the evidence of the police witnesses was supported by listening device material in relation to two of them. I do not think it necessary to go into the detail, beyond reiterating that in my view this was a strong Crown case. 
      
       
     6 The appellant, in her sworn evidence, denied the transactions and sought to place exculpatory explanations upon the intercepted conversations as recorded pursuant to the listening device warrants. The jury obviously did not accept that explanation. 
      
       
     7 The count of deemed supply of methylamphetamine on 11 July 2000, on which the appellant was also convicted, related to the events that occurred in effect on the occasion when the appellant was arrested. There was a search warrant that was executed. The police officers burst into the appellant's home, the home she shared with her de facto husband, a Mr Harris, and her children. There was evidence from one of the officers that she appeared to be trying to hide something. Her hand was forced open and the officer found a small ball of plastic gladwrap in her hand, the contents of which were analysed and later found to contain some cannabis leaf. 
      
       
     8 The search of the appellant's premises was video taped by the police and played to the court. It showed that in the kitchen there was a plastic snaplock bag, containing white powder, and there was equipment indicative of an ongoing situation, whereby the larger quantity of the white methylamphetamine was broken down into smaller quantities for street sale. There was also found in the kitchen, a number of $50 notes, bundles of notes, and a number of white paper envelopes containing substantial sums of money. Also found there was a bank withdrawal slip, or some such document, which showed ""available balance $3,303"". 
      
       
     9 The following exchange took place between the police officer Taylor, Mr Harris and the appellant. 
      
       
        
         
         TAYLOR: Do you agree that for there it says ""available balance $3,303""? 
          
         HARRIS: Um. 
          
         TAYLOR: That was on the 17th of the 6th. HARRIS: What about it? 
          
         TAYLOR: I was just saying, do you agree to that. That's all? 
          
         HARRIS: Yeah. 
          
         TAYLOR: How do you come to have $3000 in the bank? 
          
         HARRIS: Fuck, I was working. What do you think I am, a lazy black cunt. I was working at the abattoir and that. I have been working at a few places. 
          
         BEVAN: Plus all the money we have won on the poker machines. 
          
         TAYLOR: So we are going to count all the money now... 
         
        
        
       And then there was further discussion. 
        
       
     10 The appellant gave sworn evidence in which she denied participating in the transactions of actual supply. She raised a defence of alibi in relation to one of the occasions. She put an explanation upon an apparently incriminating part of the intercepted conversation. And as regards the material found in the kitchen on the date of the police raid she said in effect that she knew nothing about it; the equipment was not in her possession; and that it was all to do with her husband and his own drug problems. 
      
       
     11 She was cross-examined and this was latish on a Friday afternoon of the trial, being a trial that took place in the country. The Crown Prosecutor asked a number of questions relating to the family wealth. Individual assets were asked about, income and expenditure were explored. The appellant was saying, in effect, that she and her husband were living off social security payments, and that their house and other assets were acquired on borrowed money, that in effect they did not have great sums of money at their disposal. 
      
       
     12 The thrust of the cross-examination, so far as one can perceive really what it was about, was to suggest that there was a stream of income into the family, not explicable by the social security payments, particularly having regard to outgoings, including the cost of ordinary family living for this family. 
      
       
     13 In the context of that broader cross-examination, the appellant was asked about the conversation, as recorded on the video that I have already recounted. She said in effect that the question about the $3000 in the bank was addressed to her husband Mick, as it clearly was. She was then asked about her own interjection about, ""plus all the money we have won on the poker machines"". 
      
       
     14 The cross-examiner put to her: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. So you are saying that moneys that you have got in the house were won on poker machines? 
          
         A. No, not all of it, some of it would have been, yes. 
          
         Q. Well, how much would have? 
          
         A. I couldn't honestly tell you, probably a couple of grand out of it.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     15 The Crown Prosecutor asked her when that money was won, and she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can't recall. It's probably anywhere within that time. Like, we went to clubs, pubs whatever.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     16 It is not at all clear what she was referring to when she said ""within that time"". 
      
       
     17 The cross-examiner then asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. How much did you put through the machines to win the couple of grand? 
          
         A. It depends on the machines. Sometimes we put $20 in, sometimes we might put $50 in. If we win we might put another $20 in.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     18 This cross-examination is understandable, at least to a degree, as being referable to the conversation at the time of the police raid, and in particular, the conversation in which the police officers were exploring the source of the $3000 then currently in what appears to have been the family bank account. The date of that raid was 11 July 2000, and as is already apparent the balance date of the bank account was 17 June 2000. 
      
       
     19 The Crown Prosecutor then moved into what was clearly much more dangerous waters, because he put it to the accused: 
      
       
        
         
         “It's fair to say isn't it, that you have put a lot of money through the RSL Club? 
          
         A. No, I wouldn't say a lot of money, no.” 
          
         
        
       
     20 He then cross-examined her, obviously using a document, in which he put to her the suggestion that between particular dates, namely 1 January 1998 and 11 March 1999 at the Bathurst RSL Club, she put $43,087.52 through the poker machines, and her husband Michael Harris, put $52,671.10 through the poker machines. 
      
       
     21 The witness said that she did not think that that was the amount that was put through. She said at one stage: 
      
       
        
         
         “... if we won anything we'd pull it out. We don't go and put it all back in the machines, no way.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     22 It is very clear that the cross-examiner was using a document, because he read out a reference to ""turnover"" and put other material to her, in circumstances that involved a clear breach of s 44 of the Evidence Act. All this took place without any objection from counsel. 
      
       
     23 At one stage the cross-examiner said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You see that totals almost $100,000 doesn't it, what you have put through the machines during those dates?” 
          
          
         A. I have never put that much money through the machines"". 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     24 It would appear that the $100,000 was the rough total of the two sums involving the appellant and her husband shown in the RSL document. 
      
       
     25 The cross-examiner endeavoured to get her to agree to some lesser, but nevertheless substantial sum of money having been put through the poker machines during that period. But in substance she would not commit herself, or be drawn on any such figure. 
      
       
     26 Following this cross-examination there were some further questions asked about assets and income. There was however, no attempt to link temporally the RSL information which ended on 11 March 1999 and the evidence concerning the family assets at the time of the police raid some 18 months later.  
      
       
     27 The cross-examination concluded, as I say, on the Friday afternoon and presumably everybody returned to Sydney. 
      
       
     28 Counsel for the appellant, no doubt pondered what had really happened, or not happened on the Friday afternoon, and first thing on the Monday morning, back at Bathurst, he raised the fact that the accused had been cross-examined in relation to her assets and in relation to the poker machine money. He said that he had never been put on notice of that intention by the prosecutor, to which his Honour quite properly asked, well, whether there was any need for him to be put on notice. 
      
       
     29 The point however, seems to have been that Mr Walsh, the barrister, was saying that he was caught on the hop, as it were. I think it can also be said in partial defence of his non-objecton, that it was far from clear what period the cross-examiner was intending to get up to, or where the cross-examination was going to end up. Counsel, as he explained at one stage to his Honour, was reticent to interrupt cross-examination of his client by the Crown Prosecutor, and it is perhaps the case that he thought that there was going to be some closer linkage between the material that was endeavoured to be adduced and the matter the issue in the trial. 
      
       
     30 After having explained again his difficulty in not knowing really what was going to happen, counsel applied for a discharge of the jury. He put it to his Honour that the cross-examination had created an unfairness and prejudice to the accused. He submitted (and I do not think this was disputed) that it had never been part of the prosecution case that the accumulation of assets came from the playing of poker machines, or that the inherent suggestion of laundering money through poker machines was part of that Crown case. He also complained about a breach of the rule in the Queen's Case as embodied in s 44 of the Evidence Act. 
      
       
     31 The learned judge refused the application to discharge the jury, and he gave a five page extempore judgment. His Honour, in effect, acquitted the Crown Prosecutor of any impropriety or unfairness. He did observe that everybody was under some time pressure, because it had not been possible to sit beyond 3 o'clock on the Friday afternoon, and he had put it to the prosecutor that he ought to complete the cross-examination on the Friday afternoon, rather than have it spread over a weekend. This may provide a further clue as to why objections were not taken at the time. 
      
       
     32 His Honour appears to have accepted that there had been a breach of s 44, but he did say this: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view although there may have been breaches of proper approach, which I have highlighted, one must not forget whether or not there is a proper cross-examination and its matters are properly brought before the jury (sic). 
         
        
        
         
         In my view the prosecutor did have the right to raise these matters. There was a clear indication that the excuse, or one of the excuses given for having such sums of money on 11 July 2000 was that they had been playing poker machines. The prosecutor is, in my view, entitled to cross-examine upon those matters, whether or not he should have, in the ancient tradition of the prosecutor's role, given some sort of notice is another matter. The real question for me is whether this trial can proceed, and in my view, there is no unfairness. There is no prejudice. It is perfectly proper material to raise, and I reject the application. 
         
        
        
         
         In accordance though, with the request from Mr Walsh, I note that the prosecutor has undertaken to the court that he will not refer to those matters again, particularly in his final address and that he has no other material on which he seeks to reopen his case. I, for my part, will not say anything to the jury about any of that part of the evidence.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     33 Immediately after the judgment was given, counsel for the appellant, when asked was there anything else, said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “WALSH: No your Honour. I note your Honour says that your Honour will not say anything to the jury. I would be asking your Honour to ask the jury to disregard that evidence. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: What, and say something highlighting it? 
          
         WALSH: Well, just to tell them to disregard it. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: Why should I do that? 
          
         WALSH: Well, in my respectful -- 
          
         HIS HONOUR: It's evidence that I have found is properly admitted. Why should I tell them to disregard it? Mr Walsh, she did say, as the prosecutor rightly pointed out, ""plus all the money we've won on the poker machines"". I mean, if one can't probe and test that I'm blowed if I know what you can test and probe. 
          
         WALSH: Well, your Honour, the situation is that the period was 1 January 1998 to 11 March 1999. 
          
         HIS HONOUR: So? That might be the start of it. The fact that they can lead to the very period doesn't stop cross-examination. 
          
         WALSH: I just asked your Honour to -- 
          
         HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right. Thank you. I have noted that. Anything else?” 
         
        
       
     34 Counsel for the appellant then called a witness, Mr Flannery, who was involved with the RSL, and he endeavoured to elicit evidence explaining how a relatively minor initial investment could produce a relatively high turnover figure in poker machines. It is probably the case that Mr Flannery did get that much evidence before the jury, although the explanation was a somewhat confusing one, and the jury must have been left wondering what exactly it had established, and in any event, what all the talk about poker machine turnover had to do with the matter before them. 
      
       
     35 At the very end of the examination there was an answer, or partial answer given by the witness: 
      
       
        
         
         “A. Well, at $200 a week you'd, probably would turnover on average, again multiply that by 10, each $2000 in turnover, so -- “ 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     36 It is clear that he was endeavouring to explain that an investment of a particular sum of money could, in the ordinary course, produce a turnover ten times that figure. That answer was objected to, and the evidence was rejected. The matter was not pressed any further, and there was no cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. 
      
       
     37 His Honour did deliver the following Parthian shot: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I suppose a punter would know, most punters would know what they are winning or losing at the end of each session, wouldn't they? 
          
         A. Yes, I would think so.” 
         
        
        
       
     38 It is not clear what that question was directed to, but the answer was at least capable of casting some uncertainty on the credit of the appellant's evidence. 
      
       
     39 The summing up then proceeded, and consistent with his Honour's indication, nothing was said in relation to the poker machine evidence. 
      
       
     40 This was a case in which the jury were reminded that the Crown put the case upon a basis of involvement in a joint enterprise between the appellant and her husband, and that that was an explanation of the drugs in the premises, consistent with the appellant's guilt. 
      
       
     41 Toward the end of the summing up, counsel for the appellant sought a direction to the effect that the jury be directed to dismiss from their minds evidence about the house, caravan and poker machines that was put to the accused in cross-examination by the prosecutor. Counsel asked his Honour to tell the jury that such matters have absolutely no relevance to this case, and such matters, or suggestions do not form part of the prosecution case, and the prosecution cannot rely on such matters. His Honour declined to give such direction. 
      
       
     42 His Honour also never directed the jury that questions put to a witness that were not assented to by the witness could not be treated as evidence. 
      
       
     43 The appeal is put on a number of bases. The grounds of appeal asserted miscarriage of justice resulting from improper cross-examination, breach of s 44, wrongful refusal to discharge the jury, and error in failing to direct the jury to disregard the relevant part of the cross-examination of the appellant. In essence, all of the matters coalesce. 
      
       
     44 In my view, this trial did miscarry, having regard to the matters to which I have adverted. It is most unfortunate, because as I have already said it was a strong Crown case, and it was quite unnecessary for the Crown Prosecutor to have embarked upon this discursion. It is true that there was no objection taken, but as I have indicated one can perhaps at least reach an understanding why that occurred. 
      
       
     45 But the real problem, it seems to me, occurs in what was not done on the Monday and following after the cross-examination. The Crown had put before the jury, in breach of s 44 of the Evidence Act, material clearly suggestive of the fact that the appellant, and her husband, had been in possession of very substantial sums of money, not explicable by their social security legitimate source of family income. It is true that nothing was said about the matter in addresses, so it appears, and nothing was said in the summing up. But in one sense that is the problem. The material was just left there hanging. 
      
       
     46 The Crown before us accepts that at the end of the day, the end of Friday, the material was inadmissible, except so it was submitted on the basis that it was a legitimate response to the statement made by the appellant seeking to explain the $3000 in the family bank account. In my view that linkage was never established, particularly because of the substantial time lapse between the evidence in the RSL document that was used in the cross-examination and the time of the police raid. 
      
       
     47 The cross-examination left an uncertain pall hanging over the appellant and her credibility. There was, at the very least, a suggestion that she and her husband had accumulated property in time past from illicit dealings, and had, what's more, endeavoured to cover their tracks by churning the money through the poker machines. 
      
       
     48 The large sums of money that were put to the witness were capable of being neutralized to a significant degree, had the jury been given a direction about the evidence that Mr Flannery was at least endeavouring to get before them. But at the critical part of his evidence, there was a successful Crown objection and in any event, the trial judge did not give the jury any assistance about that matter. 
      
       
     49 The Crown invokes the proviso, relying upon the strength of the Crown case, and the submission that ultimately the evidence was not prejudicial. 
      
       
     50 It is true that one benign version of the evidence is that it corroborated the appellant's assertion that she and her husband gambled a lot on the poker machines. But there were also the overtones, or undertones, of worse. And there was a distinct possibility that the jury would have picked up on them and used them as part of their negative assessment of the appellant's credibility. 
      
       
     51 The s25A charge, as indicated, depended upon three proven actual supplies, within a constrained timeframe. Two of those actual supplies were ones in which the police evidence was corroborated by the listening device material, but a third was not. It was therefore a situation in which it was the evidence of the police officers against the evidence of the appellant. 
      
       
     52 The jury were well entitled to have accepted the evidence of the police officers, but that is not the issue. I do not consider this was a situation in which it is appropriate to apply the proviso. In my view the unfortunate miscarriage of the trial means that the conviction must be set aside. I would order a new trial. 
      
       
     53 BARR J: I agree. 
      
       
     54 McCLELLAN J: I also agree. 
      
       
     55 MASON P: The order of the Court therefore is, that the appeal is upheld. The convictions are set aside, and a new trial is ordered.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: The appellant, Pulusila Hokafonu, was convicted on 28 June 2000, following a trial before Davidson DCJ and a jury, on a charge pursuant to s 233B(1)(cb) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He was found guilty of having conspired with Kevin Michael Geraghty, Peter Hardwicke and others, between 11 September 1996 and 25 November 1996 in Sydney, to import prohibited imports to Australia, namely not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine. His Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 8 ½ years from 28 June 2000 with a non-parole period of 5 years. The appellant appeals his conviction. He raises three grounds of appeal as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The directions given by the learned trial judge pursuant to s.165 Evidence Act 1995 on the unreliability of the witness Hardwicke were inadequate. 
        
        
       2. The directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to the use the jury could and could not, make of the lack of explanation of documentary evidence by the appellant were inadequate. 
        
        
       3. The directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to the appellant’s entry into a pre-existing conspiracy were inadequate. 
        
       
     2 At the outset it should be observed that no complaint was made to his Honour at the conclusion of the Summing-Up, nor at any other time, with respect to any of the directions set out in the grounds of appeal. Accordingly, the appellant needs leave to argue the grounds and Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules will need to be considered. 
      
       
     3 The facts are briefly, that the appellant allegedly entered into a conspiracy with Geraghty and Hardwicke at North Sydney to import cocaine from Los Angeles to Sydney. The agreement was that the appellant would tape packages of cocaine to his body with Hardwicke’s assistance; board a flight bound for Sydney; and, while on the plane and in the air, remove the packages and place them in a rubbish receptacle. The packages were to be later retrieved from the rubbish receptacle in Sydney by one of Geraghty’s associates, and ‘cut and delivered’. 
      
       
     4 At trial the Crown case relied on the evidence of Hardwicke. He had served a sentence on an unrelated matter in the U.S. and received a discount on that sentence and an indemnity from prosecution in this matter. The defence at the trial was that it was Hardwicke who had placed the packages into the receptacle and had then fabricated a story that it was the appellant who had done so. It was suggested to Hardwicke in cross-examination that he had ‘set-up’ the appellant (after being thrown out of a nightclub by him) by placing articles in the appellant’s luggage and noting various details upon them. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 – Directions under s 165  
       Evidence Act  
       inadequate 
        
       
     5 While his Honour gave extensive unreliability directions pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995, to which no complaint was made by the appellant’s trial counsel, it is the submission of Ms Bashir of counsel on the appeal that there were four deficiencies or errors in the direction. 
      
       
     6 First, that Hardwicke’s fear of being dealt with, or further dealt with, had not necessarily been removed.7 Secondly, that his Honour was wrong to say that Hardwicke had not received any undertaking that he would not be prosecuted because Mr Hardwicke’s belief, given in his evidence, was to the contrary. 
      
       
     8 Thirdly, that his Honour failed to mention to the jury the significance of the benefit that Hardwicke received in the US by reason of his assistance to the US and Australian authorities, including with respect to this case. In addition, Hardwicke had a substantial and continuing incentive to assist the Australian authorities and to give evidence against the appellant, and that this was not made the subject of a warning to the jury. 
      
       
     9 Lastly, his Honour failed to explain the ‘plea agreement’ document which Hardwicke had entered into. Accordingly, his Honour’s directions were inadequate. 
      
       
     10 From very early in the Summing-Up his Honour made it abundantly plain to the jury that the Crown case against the accused depended upon the credibility of Hardwicke. He emphasised that without Hardwicke’s evidence, the Crown did not have a case against the accused.  
      
       
     11 A little later, when dealing with the issue of onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt residing in the Crown, his Honour explained: 
      
       
        
         
         … in light of what I have said as to the significance of Mr Hardwick’s evidence in relation to the Crown’s case, you will appreciate that for the purposes of this particular trial these principles, namely that the Crown bears the onus of proof and it must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt in respect of all of the necessary matters which it must prove to establish this charge, extends to the honesty and reliability and credibility of Mr Hardwick because he is vital to the Crown’s case. Unless you accept him and his evidence in relation to the essential matters which the Crown must prove to establish this charge beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Crown has failed and it would be your duty to acquit the accused. It would only be if you accepted his evidence, not in respect of every detail of what he said but in relation to the essential elements of the charge, that you would be justified in bringing in a verdict of guilty … 
         
        
       
     12 Further, his Honour’s directions were frequently premised on the basis of ‘if you accept the evidence of Hardwicke’. His Honour informed the jury that the Crown case, both of the alleged agreement between Geraghty and Hardwicke, and the accused’s subsequent participation in it, as well as his intention to play a part in carrying the drugs, were matters which depended upon the evidence of Hardwicke. In addition, Hardwicke’s evidence was strongly contested by the accused. His Honour noted that defence counsel did not go so far as to suggest that Hardwicke should not be accepted as to the existence of a conspiracy between Hardwicke and Geraghty, rather that his evidence should be rejected on the issue of the appellant ever having been a party to any such conspiracy. His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         Nevertheless it is for you to determine whether the Crown has succeeded in proving both those issues beyond reasonable doubt and it would fail if in your view it has not established either one of them. On both these issues Hardwicke is a vital witness for the Crown so that if you reject his evidence on either issue the Crown’s case fails. Such is the vital importance of his evidence that it will require as I said separate directions of law from me to you in due course as to the great care and caution which you must exercise before acting on his evidence to establish firstly, that there ever was such a pre existing conspiracy to which he and Geraghty were parties and secondly and more importantly in light of the way in which it appears that this case had been presented, whether you can accept his evidence on the issue of any subsequent participation by the accused in that pre existing conspiracy. 
         
        
       
     13 His Honour added that it was very important for the jury to remember ‘that perhaps the most vital issue in this case is whether you do accept Hardwicke’s evidence …’.  
      
       
     14 Later in the Summing-Up, his Honour gave directions in law as to Hardwicke’s evidence. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         What you must be satisfied about, however, is that he is a witness whose evidence you accept beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the essential matters which the Crown must prove, more particularly you may think as to the accused’s acts on which the Crown relies for the conclusion that the accused became a party to this alleged conspiracy. 
         
        
        
         
         You will appreciate that whilst the accused bears no onus of proving anything in this case and the onus remains at all times on the Crown to establish its case, it is put to you on his behalf that after reviewing all the evidence and taking into consideration principles of law, which I am about to explain to you, on this issue you will not regard him as a witness of sufficient or indeed any reliability or credibility on the issue particularly of the accused being a party to any such conspiracy. 
         
        
        
         
         What has been put to you, as I understand it, is that you will regard it as at least a reasonable possibility that Hardwicke was not only the negotiator and facilitator in relation to this November 1996 alleged drug deal, it was he himself who took the cocaine onto the plane and put it into the garbage chute and then sought to blame two innocent fellow passengers so as to minimise his own involvement and perhaps also to be able to do a more favourable deal for himself with prosecuting authorities both here and in the United States. 
         
        
        
         
         If at the end of your deliberations you are of the view that that is a reasonable possibility on the evidence in the case, you will be obliged as a matter of law to acquit the accused. If on the other hand you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Hardwicke is telling the truth as to his own and the accused’s participation, it would be open to you to find that the Crown has proved its case and to return a verdict of guilty. 
         
        
       
     15 His Honour then said that Hardwicke’s importance to the Crown case was such that without his evidence, the Crown would have no case. There would be no evidence of any pre-existing conspiracy and no evidence linking anything to the appellant. His Honour then directed the jury that Hardwicke’s evidence may be unreliable and, for that reason alone, they should exercise great care and caution before acting on it.  
      
       
     16 His Honour turned to ‘other matters relating to Hardwicke’s honesty and reliability as a witness’. His Honour commented that Hardwicke was: 
      
       
        
         
         … on his own account … a paid participant in this criminal offence charged against the accused. I warn you that for that reason alone his evidence may be unreliable. The reason for that you may think is fairly obvious. People who are themselves criminally concerned in an offence and who turn up as witnesses against another or other alleged participants in that same offence may be influenced by motives of wanting to curry favour with the authorities so as to gain as favourable as possible a result for themselves. 
         
        
        
         
         Witnesses who fall into that category, that is to say as participants in the alleged crime who are witnesses against others said or alleged to have been participants, fall into two categories. They may themselves have been charged and dealt with through the courts or, if not, given by the appropriate prosecuting authority a formal written undertaking to the effect that he or she will not be prosecuted for any such offence as disclosed in that evidence provided at the trial of one or more of their fellow alleged criminal colleagues, they cooperate and they give truthful and complete evidence in the witness box. 
         
        
        
         
         The effect of either of these two courses being taken, that is to say dealing firstly with that witness, charging him or her, having him brought before a court and completing the matters with which they might be charged and then calling that person as a witness or alternatively giving to that witness a formal written undertaking that he or she will not be prosecuted is this. It, at least to some extent, removes from the witness an incentive to further curry favour with the prosecuting authorities and that exaggerate or gild the lily or even lie in giving evidence so as to make the prosecution’s case stronger, that it really would be or really is against an accused person, that’s because the fear of being dealt with or further dealt with has been removed. He has got no incentive, she has got not incentive or motive to curry favour with the authorities, because either he or she has been dealt with according to law or have in this possession a written undertaking not to be prosecuted for any offence disclosed by their evidence in which they were a participant. 
         
        
        
         
         At least so far as the Australian prosecuting authorities and they are the important ones because that is where Hardwicke is you may think, at least so far those prosecuting authorities are concerned, Mr Hardwicke does not fall into that category. He has not been charged, as I understand the position, with the offence which is the subject of these proceedings nor has he received any undertaking that he will not be prosecuted. At least if he has there is certainly no evidence of that before you. He has received no formal undertaking that he would not be prosecuted and that he has not been charged or dealt with in respect of any offence disclosed in his evidence so far as the evidence takes us in this case. He is not in the situation where he has had that major incentive to continue to curry favour by telling lies to strengthen the prosecution case removed. He remains in that position. All that he has received are undertakings to the effect that what he has said and will say in this and any other courtroom presumably and anything which may be discovered or obtained in consequence of that evidence will not be used against him if he is prosecuted. That does not, of course, as such provide him with protection against prosecution, also that to this extent that, as I have said, he continues to have that assumed incentive to exaggerate or even to lie of which I spoke earlier. 
         
        
        
         
         Accordingly, I remind you again of the need for great caution in deciding whether to accept and act upon his evidence and that the weight which you give to it. 
         
        
       
     17 His Honour then turned to further matters affecting Hardwicke’s credibility. These included criminal dishonesty involving credit card fraud which involved concealing his identity. Hardwicke had also admitted in evidence that he had told lies on a number of occasions in giving evidence in court relating to his involvement with drugs. He admitted making deliberately false statements.  
      
       
     18 His Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         This too I direct you is a substantial group of matters which you should take into account in deciding whether you can act on his evidence at all and if so to what extent and perhaps the most important of these matters and the most significant on this issue is his admission that he has told lies, apparently on oath, on other occasions. If he has indeed committed perjury on other occasions, then you may ask yourselves can you really accept his evidence at all in what he said to you. 
         
        
       
     19 Davidson DCJ then discussed aspects of the evidence which might serve to dispel doubts that the jury might otherwise have as to Hardwicke’s honesty and reliability as a witness. 
      
       
     20 In summarising the case for the accused, his Honour further elaborated on the issue of Hardwicke’s credibility, including the proposition that he had planted material on the appellant to save his own skin ‘in so far as he could by currying favour with the authorities’. His Honour drew attention again to a number of particular aspects of Hardwicke’s dishonesty, some of which he had already directed the jury on and some additional instances referred to by defence counsel. His Honour also drew attention to the ‘plea bargain’ in the US between Hardwicke and the authorities. 
      
       
     21 As I have said, his Honour was not asked to supplement his directions with respect to Mr Hardwicke, nor was it suggested that his directions pursuant to s 165 were in any way inadequate or deficient. 
      
       
     22 It is correct that his Honour did not expressly direct the jury on the benefit to Hardwicke in the US by virtue of his plea agreement. However, the document was in evidence and Hardwicke was cross-examined about it at length. It was also read and explained to the jury in some detail.  
      
       
     23 When the plea agreement was tendered, without objection, his Honour noted that the tender was limited to the words which it used and not as evidence of the facts. His Honour read to the jury various parts of the agreement which he considered to be of significance. He invited counsel to draw attention to any other parts but they did not do so. His Honour explained to the jury what the document was and said, inter alia: 
      
       
        
         
         … but the essence of it you may think that in exchange of promise to these American law enforcement agency, the witness was to get from the law enforcement agency in the United States their assistance and co-operation in putting before the court a case which would endeavour to ensure that he would get a substantially decreased sentence than that which he would otherwise have got. That promise of co-operation extended beyond United States law enforcement authorities to the Australian Federal Police authorities so, that it requires him to cooperate, not only with the American authorities but with the Australian authorities. If he failed to do so then there is a sanction which is set out in the agreement which may befall him. Of course the object of bringing all this to your attention is that it is a factor and a very important factor as I will be pointing out to you I expect in due course, which you will take into consideration as to whether or not you are able to accept this witness’s evidence in any respect. It is not the only factor but it is as I have said a substantial factor. 
         
        
       
     24 His Honour then asked counsel if there was anything further he should tell the jury, but neither counsel made any request. While his Honour indicated in the above extract from the transcript that he would return to it later, he did not do so in explicit terms, although he did make reference to it in the Summing-Up. 
      
       
     25 When the relevant portions of the Summing-Up are read, and reasonably read, I can not see that his Honour was telling the jury that the credibility of Hardwicke was to be seen in the light that the fear of being dealt with had been removed. In any event, in the portion of the Summing-Up, seen by the appellant’s counsel as offending, his Honour referred to the removal ‘to some extent’ of the incentive to ‘further curry favour’ etc. I do not understand his Honour to be unequivocally directing the jury that the fear of being dealt with had necessarily been removed.  
      
       
     26 His Honour was correct to tell the jury that Hardwicke had not received any undertaking from the authorities that he would not be prosecuted and that there was no evidence of any such undertaking before them. His Honour was never asked to remind the jury of Hardwicke’s evidence as to his belief as to the nature of the indemnity he had received. 
      
       
     27 Counsel is critical of his Honour for not mentioning the benefit Hardwicke received in the US in a reduced sentence with no parole by virtue of his assistance to the US and Australian authorities. It is submitted that the plea agreement was not the subject to any warning to the jury. 
      
       
     28 It is accurate to say that his Honour did not expressly instruct the jury in his Summing-Up as to the benefit to Hardwick in his US sentence and warn them about the nature of the plea agreement. However, his Honour did refer to it during the Summing-Up and he did clearly warn the jury when the agreement was tendered. 
      
       
     29 This warning, although not repeated in the Summing-Up, was in plain terms. No complaint was made by trial counsel for the accused at his Honour’s omission in the Summing-Up to return to the agreement. By the close of the Summing-Up the jury could be in no doubt whatever that the trial was about whether they accepted the reliability and credibility of Hardwicke’s evidence. The jury knew full well that the Crown case rose or fell on his evidence. They had been given extensive warnings about Hardwicke’s evidence, including strong warnings in accordance with s 165.30 It is very difficult to comprehend that even if any of the inadequacies claimed by counsel for the appellant were made out, there was any possibility of a real injustice being done to the appellant. If there be irregularity in the proceedings, the appellant needs to establish that they go to the root of the proceedings in order to be able to obtain leave to rely on a ground not taken at trial (R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183). I cannot see that the complaints of the appellant’s counsel can be seen as going to the heart of the proceedings given the context of his Honour’s Summing-Up and his explicit warnings to the jury. I am unable to appreciate how the so-called inadequacies and omissions would have had any impact on the verdict. Counsel at trial has a duty to object at trial (R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531) and there must be some convincing reason shown why the matter was not raised. Here no reason is advanced. 
      
       
     31 In R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260 a failure to comply with s 165(2)(b) of the Evidence Act was argued. However, the majority were of the view that Rule 4 should be applied because there was no possibility of a miscarriage of justice, see in particular Howie J at [163]. To test whether there was an injustice, one needs to have regard to the Summing-Up as a whole and the manner in which the trial was conducted. 
      
       
     32 In paragraph [168] Howie J said: 
      
       
        
         
         I am not persuaded that the absence of a specific reference to the matter of the discount of his Honour’s omission to refer to the consequences for Braddick if he failed to give evidence in accordance with his undertaking resulted in a miscarriage of justice in the present case, having regard to the length and nature of the trial and the fact that the summing up followed directly after defence counsel’s address. The applicant should not be allowed to rely upon these matters in the absence of any complaint by counsel about the terms of the summing up or a request for any further directions at the trial. 
         
        
       
     33 In R v Jeffrey (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993) Mahoney JA discussed the importance of Rule 4 where an appellant relies on misdirections or the absence of directions to which no objection was taken at trial. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         [It] is proper to emphasise the importance of the principle embodied in R4. 
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion, this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any object to the summing up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. 
          
         … 
          
         Errors will occur and R4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. Not infrequently this Court is asked to act under R4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the court on appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under R4. In the end, the court must exercise the power given to it by R4 according to the merits of the individual case. However, in my opinion, in exercising that power, the court should keep steadily in mind the function which R4 performs in the criminal trial process. [p4] 
         
        
       
     34 His Honour’s words are pertinent and have been applied on many occasions, including in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360. In my opinion, Rule 4 should be applied in this instance. No Summing-Up can be perfect, especially with the implications brought about by the Evidence Act. Nor should a ‘Summing-Up’ have to reach the counsel of perfection. As Mahoney JA said, defects or omissions can be cured or mitigated by being raised at the trial. We have been given no inkling as to why no attempt was made to cure the alleged deficiencies. For all we know, the failure to raise the matter may have been deliberate. Bearing in mind the comprehensive directions in the Summing-Up about the credibility and reliability of Hardwicke, counsel for the accused may well have been satisfied. Considering the Summing-Up as a whole, including many of the passages I have referred to earlier, I am unable to see that there is a possibility of a real injustice having been occasioned to the appellant, even assuming the deficiencies alleged by the appellant’s counsel. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 - directions regarding lack of explanations regarding certain evidence 
        
       
     35 The appellant is critical of his Honour regarding remarks that he made concerning formal admissions made by the appellant and the finding of certain items in the appellant’s home. In particular, it is submitted that his Honour’s comment that ‘there is no explanation on the evidence before you as to how the accused came to have those documents from any source’ transgressed Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 75 ALR 349. Again, it should be noted that no complaint was made to his Honour by trial counsel. 
      
       
     36 I can see no such transgression of Azzopardi. The relevant portions of the Summing-Up concerned two matters. One was certain formal admissions made by counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial and the second was various documents found by the police at the appellant’s premises. 
      
       
     37 His Honour noted that the Crown relied on ‘a number of unchallenged pieces of evidence’ to support Hardwicke’s account of the appellant’s involvement in the conspiracy. His Honour said that it was unchallenged that certain items were found by police at the appellant’s home. However, he said that the appellant had challenged Mr Hardwicke as to how they came to be there and that they were being asked to accept that they had been planted by Hardwicke in an attempt to incriminate the appellant and to direct attention away from his own criminal involvement. 
      
       
     38 His Honour then referred to the formal admissions made by the accused. These showed that the appellant was in California at the relevant time with another man, whom he identified as Tohulo. The admissions included his staying at a hotel which had a telephone number upon which Hardwicke said he was able to contact the appellant. Also, the appellant admitted that he travelled back to Sydney with Tohulo on the same flight as Hardwicke. 
      
       
     39 His Honour then referred to some of the documents found by police in the appellant’s home. It was in this context that his Honour made the statement about which counsel for the appellant now complains. 
      
       
     40 What his Honour was saying in the comment was that there was no explanation in the evidence as to how the accused came to have the documents at his home. His Honour then referred to cross-examination of Hardwicke to the effect that he had slipped them into the appellant’s luggage at Los Angeles airport, which Hardwicke denied. In this context his Honour reminded the jury that there was no evidentiary value in a question. No complaint is made about this direction, nor indeed could it have been made. 
      
       
     41 Conventionally his Honour told the jury that an accused person never has to establish his innocence and that he was entitled to the presumption of innocence. Further, his Honour did not make any direction or any comment or remark on the failure of the appellant to give evidence. The remark complained about was not such a comment and did not transgress that which was subsequently said by the High Court in Azzopardi. 
      
       
     42 I have already said that the trial judge made it absolutely plain to the jury that the Crown case depended entirely on the credibility of Hardwicke. It was for the jury to determine what they thought of Hardwicke’s denials in cross-examination relating to the claim that he planted the items in the appellant’s luggage in order to set him up. 
      
       
     43 Again, this is a point which draws Rule 4 into play and it is my opinion that leave should be refused to argue the matter. There is no explanation as to why the point was not taken at the trial and it is not apparent that what his Honour said, which is the subject of the appellant’s complaint, involved the possibility of a real injustice to the appellant. 
      
       
       Ground 3 - directions concerning appellant’s entry into the conspiracy 
        
       
     44 Counsel for the appellant submits that his Honour’s explanation and directions to the jury about the entry by the accused into a pre-existing conspiracy between Geraghty and Hardwicke was inadequate. In particular, it is contended that his Honour should have directed the jury that if there was a possibility that the conspiracy, as far as it involved the appellant, took place in a place other than Sydney (as per the indictment) they must acquit. Again, it must be noted that no complaint was made to the trial judge by trial counsel. 
      
       
     45 I can see no substance in the submission. His Honour referred to the evidence of a meeting at North Sydney between Geraghty, Hardwicke and the appellant, at which Geraghty introduced the appellant to Hardwicke. It was open to the jury to infer from the evidence of the subsequent events in Los Angeles and the return to Sydney, that the agreement was made in Sydney and continued back to Sydney where the drugs were to be delivered and distributed. 
      
       
     46 Whether the jury accepted that the agreement was made in Sydney again depended on whether Hardwicke’s evidence was accepted. If it was, then there was evidence that the agreement was reached in Sydney and the conspiracy continued to its ultimate object to be achieved in Sydney. 
      
       
     47 A reading of the Summing-Up persuades me that his Honour’s instructions to the jury on this element in the offence was comprehensive and reveals no error. In any event, Rule 4 should again be applied and leave be refused to argue the matter. 
      
       
     48 Even assuming all or any of the appellant’s submissions on his Honour’s directions are correct, the appellant did not lose the chance of acquittal and the proviso applies. In the result, it is my view that the appeal should be dismissed.49 O’KEEFE J: I agree with Stein JA 
      
       
     50 BUDDIN J: I agree with Stein JA.

      REGINA v RTB 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 THE COURT: The appellant (“RTB”) was charged with a number of sexual offences under the Crimes Act, 1900. The charges alleged either sexual intercourse (s66A) or acts of indecency (s61O(2)) with a person under the age of ten years. They arose out of allegations made by two sisters. The complainants will each be given a pseudonym to preserve their anonymity. The older girl will be referred to as “Jennifer”, and the younger as “Elizabeth”. At the time of the alleged offences, Jennifer was eight years old and Elizabeth five years. The appellant was, at that time, sixteen years old. 
      
       
     2 An order was made that there should be separate trials in respect of each complainant. Those relating to the older girl, Jennifer, proceeded first before Knight DCJ and a jury. There were three counts. RTB was convicted on one count. 
      
       
     3 The second trial took place some months later. It was also conducted by Knight DCJ with another jury. There were two counts. RTB was convicted on both. 
      
       
     4 Appeals against conviction have been lodged in respect of both trials. We will describe the first trial, and deal with the grounds of appeal in respect of that trial. We will then deal with the second trial. 
      
       
        
       The first trial 
       
     5 Jennifer was one of a number of children from a family living in Dubbo. The appellant also lived in Dubbo. He was involved in a local sporting team. The coach of that team was Jennifer’s father. Through that association the appellant became well known to the family. Indeed, the two families became friends. There was regular contact. From time to time, RTB was asked to baby sit Jennifer, her brothers and sisters, whilst the parents were shopping or otherwise occupied. In March 1997 Jennifer complained to her father that RTB had made her “suck his private”. A confrontation took place between the two families. RTB denied the accusation. Jennifer was then taken to the police, where she made a statement. She was also examined by a local paediatrician on 8 April 1997. As a consequence, RTB was charged with three offences under s66A of the Crimes Act. The charges were (omitting formal parts) as follows: 
      
       
     · That between 1 August 1996 and 25 December 1996 at Dubbo he did have sexual intercourse with (Jennifer) a person then under the age of 10 years.· Further that between 1 December 1996 and 25 December 1996 at Dubbo he did have sexual intercourse with (Jennifer) a person then under the age of 10 years. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · Further that between 1 January 1997 and 12 January at Dubbo he did have sexual intercourse with (Jennifer) a person then under the age of 10 years. 
      
       
     6 The Crown opened to the jury, identifying the particular acts of intercourse alleged. In respect of the first count, the Crown relied upon an act of anal intercourse. The second involved an allegation that, after the break up of school and before Christmas 1996, RTB inserted his finger into Jennifer’s vagina. The third count involved an incident which allegedly took place shortly before Jennifer’s ninth birthday on 12 January 1997. It was said that RTB asked Jennifer to “suck his private”. This was the complaint which the father said had been related to him in March 1997. 
      
       
     7 The complainant gave evidence by video link. She said, relevant to the first count, that RTB had followed her into her parents’ bedroom. He removed her clothing. He then “put his private in my bottom”. She also said this: (T22) 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When he put his private in your bottom did you feel anything? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did it cause you anything when that happened? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How long did that go on for? 
          
         A. Long time.” 
         
        
       
     8 Jennifer said that she rearranged her clothing and left the room. 
      
       
     9 The complainant next gave evidence concerning the incident shortly before her ninth birthday. Again, she was in her parents’ bedroom when RTB entered. Again he removed her shorts. At the same time, according to her testimony, he loosened his trousers. She said that “he made me suck his private”, saying, “suck my private until I come”. 
      
       
     10 The complainant also said that whilst this was taking place her six year old sister entered the room. RTB immediately stopped and pushed her behind the door. Her sister then left the room. 
      
       
     11 No evidence was given by the complainant in support of the second count (which involved digital penetration of the vagina). His Honour ultimately directed a verdict on that count. 
      
       
     12 Dr Geraghty was called in the Crown case. Her evidence was first taken on the voir dire, where counsel for RTB made known his objections to certain statements in her report. His Honour made a number of rulings. Dr Geraghty then gave evidence before the jury. That evidence is the subject of specific grounds of appeal (Grounds 2 and 3), which are considered below. 
      
       
     13 The appellant also gave evidence. He denied each charge. He acknowledged that, from time to time, he babysat for the family. Often he would take his girlfriend to their home. The allegations were made in March 1997 after it had been announced that his family was moving to another town. Jennifer’s parents were angry about his family’s departure. They offered RTB a room in their house. The allegations had been fabricated by Jennifer, possibly at the suggestion of her parents. 
      
       
     14 The jury, as mentioned, returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count, but guilty on the third count. 
      
       
        
       The Notice of Appeal 
       
     15 The Notice of Appeal in respect of the first trial identified a number of grounds. Only some of the grounds were pressed when the appeal was argued. The formulation of the grounds in the Notice of Appeal is discursive. Paraphrasing those grounds which were pressed, they were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         2. That his Honour was in error in allowing Dr Geraghty to give the history provided by the complainant during the course of the medical examination. 
         
        
        
         
         3. That his Honour ought to have directed the jury as to the relevance of the history provided to the doctor. 
         
        
        
         
         4. That his Honour ought to have directed the jury as to the inference arising as a consequence of the failure of the Crown to call the six year old sister. 
         
        
        
         
         6. That his Honour was in error in suggesting a possible explanation for certain evidence given by the complainant in support of count 1. 
         
        
        
         
         7. That his Honour was in error in commenting upon the significance of the verdict which had been directed in respect of count 2. 
         
        
        
         
         8. That the verdicts were inconsistent. The jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt in respect of count 3. 
         
        
       
     16 Each ground will be dealt with in turn. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 2 and 3 
        
       
     17 Grounds 2 and 3 of Appeal from the first trial relate to the admission of the complainant’s history as given to Dr Geraghty and his Honour’s failure to direct the jury as to the use to which that history can be put. One issue that arose in this regard was whether or not this Court should reconsider its earlier decision in R v Welsh (1996) 98 A Crim R 364. The Court indicated that it would need to sit a bench of five if it decided to do so. The parties indicated that they would consent to a course in which the additional judges could sit, even though they had not heard the oral submissions presented to the Court when it sat in Dubbo. It has not proven to be necessary to take that course. 
      
       
     18 Dr Jennifer Geraghty was called to give evidence. Her attention was directed to the medical history given to her by a complainant (T76 lines 11-55): 
      
       
        
         
         ”Q And did that history include penile penetration of the anus? 
         
        
        
         
         A It did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And oral genital contact? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did she state that that occurred over a period of about six months and that the last incident was then about three months previously? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q As a result of having taken that history did you examine the anal and peri anal region of the patient? 
         
        
        
         
         A I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And what were your findings when you made that specific examination? 
         
        
        
         
         A The examination findings of the anal and perineal area were normal. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Having been given the history of penal penetration of the patient’s anus are you able to express an opinion as to whether what you saw was consistent with the complaint of the child that she’d been anally penetrated by a penis? 
         
        
        
         
         A The normal examination of the anus is consistent with the child’s history that she had been penetrated in the anus. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR Q I’m sorry was it consistent or inconsistent? 
         
        
        
         
         A It was consistent yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR Q Is that so doctor that you would not necessarily have found injury on the child if her anus had been penetrated by the penis of a male person? 
         
        
        
         
         A That’s correct.” 
         
        
       
     19 On a voir dire, counsel for the Respondent objected to the doctor giving evidence based on her statement relying on s137 of the Evidence Act. His Honour upheld the objection in some respects. The Crown did not adduce evidence of some matters contained in the doctor’s statement as served. Counsel for the Appellant did object to the passage of the evidence indicating that incidents of sexual assault had occurred over a period of six months. His Honour allowed this evidence.  
      
       
     20 Counsel for the Appellant on the appeal noted that the evidence eventually led from the doctor referred to two incidents, one being penile penetration of the anus and the other being oral genital contact. He submitted that the actual opinion evidence adduced from the doctor related only to anal penetration. There was no opinion evidence about the other aspect of the history given by the complainant to the doctor.  
      
       
     21 The evidence of the doctor that the complainant had told her that an unspecified number of sexual assaults had occurred over a period of six months did broaden the range of relevant conduct beyond the offences with which the Appellant was charged. Count 1 was said to have occurred in December 1996 and Count 3 in January 1997.  
      
       
     22 In the summing-up his Honour expressly mentioned that the complainant had given the doctor a history of sexual assault which occurred over a period of about six months. He then summarised the effect of the doctor’s evidence as follows (at 33): 
      
       
        
         
         “… her examination was consistent with what [the complainant] said having occurred, but it was equally consistent with it not having occurred. In other words the doctor’s evidence is neutral but it is important from this point of view because it shows that the evidence of [the complainant] could be accurate. 
         
        
        
         
         In other words the doctor’s evidence if you accept it does not in any way give the lie to what [the complainant] is saying. And you could imagine if the Crown did not call that evidence, then complaint would be able to be made well the doctor’s evidence may have said that it could not have happened. So in fact the reason why the Crown called the evidence was to enable the doctor to say well look the assault could have taken place or it could not have taken place in the way that it was described.” 
         
        
       
     23 In our opinion, part of the evidence complained of was not admissible because it was not relevant. The opinion evidence that was adduced was directed only to the issue of anal penetration. The only part of the medical history which was related to the opinion being expressed by the doctor was the assertion that there had been penile penetration of the anus. The evidence adduced went beyond that to encompass “oral genital contact”. It concluded with an unfocused statement that “that [sic] occurred over a period of about six months” with “the last incident … about three months previously”. This evidence was not the basis of the opinion. It was irrelevant for that purpose and should not have been admitted. 
      
       
     24 The doctor said that there was no physical indicator of such an occurrence. The import of her evidence was that there would not necessarily be any such indicator. No doubt evidence of this character will often be appropriate in order to ensure that a jury does not speculate about the absence of medical evidence. Where (as here) the evidence has limited materiality, consideration should be given to alternative ways in which the issue might be handled. In R v Dann (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19.5.2000) Heydon JA (with whom Spigelman CJ and James J agreed) offered the following suggestions in respect of medical evidence which was essentially ""neutral"":  
      
       
        
         
         ""16. A solution in particular cases might be for Crown and defence to agree that the evidence not be called and to agree to join in a request that the trial judge direct the jury that the jury should attribute no significance to the absence of the evidence because it is immaterial. 
         
        
        
         
         17. Another technique which might be employed where the Crown proposes to call inconclusive medical evidence is for the trial judge to secure from the defence an undertaking not to comment on the absence of the evidence if the Crown decides not to call the evidence or it is rejected. That admittedly would still leave open whatever risk of jury speculation there is."" 
         
        
       
     24 Where the doctor is called, it is undesirable, however, for such evidence to be given in a form which appears to bolster the credit of the complainant, rather than in a form that the absence of a physical indicator is neutral. (In the present case, the doctor said her observations were “consistent” with the complainant’s evidence and this became, in the trial judge’s directions, an observation that the complainant’s evidence “could be accurate”) 
      
       
     25 Further, the Crown prosecutor's opening question to Dr Geraghty (""And did that history include penile penetration of the anus?"") was leading. It obscured an important issue. The charge against the accused (Count 1) was that he had sexual intercourse. Penetration was required. The complainant had given evidence that ""he put his private in my bottom"". She added that she did not feel anything when he did so. The words of the complainant to Dr Geraghty were, therefore, important. The doctor should simply have been asked to state the relevant history, as given to her. Ground 2 is made out. 
      
       
     26 Moving to Ground 3, part of the history, as set out above, should not have been admitted. The issue is, therefore, what, if anything, should have been said to the jury in respect of that part of the history (relating to anal intercourse) which was relevant? There is an antecedent question, arising under s136 of the Evidence Act 1995. When admitting that evidence, should the Court, in its discretion, have limited the use to be made of the evidence because it was unfairly prejudicial to the accused? If its use was to be limited, then that limitation must obviously be explained to the jury.  
      
       
     27 Here the context was important. It was an alleged sexual assault upon the complainant, a young girl. There was delay in making the complaint. The Crown case depended upon the uncorroborated account of the complainant. Dr Geraghty was not a treating doctor. In such circumstances, the recital by the doctor of the history given by the complainant will often carry the risk of unfair prejudice, where the statements are admitted as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted. It may therefore be appropriate to limit the use of such evidence, so that it is received simply as the basis upon which the doctor expressed his or her opinion. In the context of this appeal, in view of the conclusion we have reached in respect of other grounds, it is unnecessary for us to comment further. 
      
       
        
       Ground 4 - Failure to call sister 
        
       
     28 The complainant’s account suggested that her six year old sister came into the room during the incident. The sister, however, was not called in the Crown case. The appellant asserted that his Honour was in error in not directing the jury as to the significance of the Crown having failed to call the sister, or explain her absence. 
      
       
     29 The submission is, of course, based upon the rule in Jones v Dunkel  (1959) 101 CLR 298. In Ghazal v GIO (1992) 29 NSWLR 336, Kirby P made the following comment upon that rule: (at 343) 
      
       
        
         
         “The rule in  
         Jones v Dunkel 
          is one of commonsense reasoning. It provides that an  
         unexplained 
          failure by a party to call a witness may, in appropriate circumstances, lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the case of the party who might be expected to call the witness. … The rule has no application if the failure to call the witness is satisfactorily explained or readily understood.”  
         (emphasis in original) 
         
        
       
     30 Here, the Crown, presumably took the view that the absence of the six year old child could be readily understood (even in the context of a prosecution based upon the evidence of a nine year old complainant). Counsel then appearing for the appellant arguably took the same view. He did not seek the direction which the appellant now suggests his Honour was obliged to give. The Crown, in its submissions, suggests, in these circumstances, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should apply. 
      
       
     31 His Honour was not obliged to give the direction suggested. Had his Honour been asked to give such a direction, he may or may not have done so. There having been no application to the trial Judge, it is appropriate to apply Rule 4 and refuse leave to appeal upon this ground. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 6 and 7 - Contents of the Summing-Up 
        
       
     32 Grounds 6 and 7 each refer to aspects of the summing-up that are of significance for the assessment by the jury of the credibility of the complainant. It is convenient to consider these two grounds together for reasons which will presently appear. 
      
       
     33 Ground 6 is concerned with the comments by the trial judge in the course of his summing-up to the jury with respect to the verdict by direction on what had been Count 2 in the original indictment. His Honour told the jury that he had concluded that, as a matter of law, the evidence given with respect to Count 2 could not establish the essential ingredients of the offence. He reminded the jury that the Crown Prosecutor had opened the second count as being a case of insertion of a finger into the vagina of the complainant. His Honour told the jury that there had been no evidence of any such incident (transcript at 105-106).  
      
       
     34 In the course of his summing-up, his Honour set out the Crown case and then turned to the case for the Appellant. He noted that counsel for the then accused had focused in his submissions on a number of alleged inconsistencies in the Appellant’s evidence. The first of these related to the verdict by direction. His Honour told the jury (at 41-42): 
      
       
        
         
         “The first one was that when this trial started out there was a second count in the indictment which you remember the Crown opened to you as finger in the vagina and as Mr Segal said quite correctly, people do not get these allegations out of the air, the Crown when he opened to you was obviously doing so off information that had been supplied to him and therefore you are entitled to infer that at some time there had been an allegation of a finger in the vagina by [the complainant] and when she gives evidence she does not mention it. So he says that that is the first inconsistency.  
         
        
        
         
         Of course that may be explicable on the basis that she simply when she was giving her evidence forgot. There is a series of events you can forget things, on the other hand even if she did you may well think that it would cause you to have some worries about her evidence.” 
         
        
       
     35 Before counsel addressed the jury, counsel for the Appellant indicated to his Honour his intention to refer to this as an example of inconsistency. The Crown Prosecutor, in the end, did not object to this submission being made. There was no indication that his Honour intended to incorporate in his summing-up any hypothesis explaining the failure to give this evidence.  
      
       
     36 After his Honour gave the above direction, counsel for the Appellant drew his Honour’s attention to the emphasis his Honour had given to the explanation favourable to the Crown case, i.e. that the complainant had forgotten to give the evidence. He referred to his Honour’s direction that the absence of the evidence would cause the jury ”to have some worries about her evidence”. Counsel asked his Honour to redirect the jury to the effect that “Maybe the evidence wasn’t given because it didn’t happen not because she forgot but because it didn’t happen”.  
      
       
     37 His Honour did redirect the jury at the end of his summing-up in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have told you that in relation to the second count which the Crown opened to you which was finger in the vagina and of which there has been a verdict by direction you are entitled to draw the inference that [the complainant] at some stage had complained about a finger in the vagina and yet when she gave her evidence she made no mention of it. There are two ways I think that you can look at that. 
         
        
        
         
         First of all you could say the evidence was not given in court because it did not happen, it was not true or alternatively you can say well perhaps the evidence was not given simply because she made a mistake in her evidence and forgot to tell her. Now they are the different ways of looking at it and they are matters for you to consider but I point out to you that you can look at it in those two different ways.” 
         
        
       
     38 Ground 6 is concerned with another matter which Counsel for the Appellant at trial put to the jury as an indication of inconsistency which it ought take into account when assessing the credibility of the complainant. This related to Count 1 of the indictment upon which the jury brought back a verdict of not guilty. 
      
       
     39 In the course of her evidence in chief the complainant said that on a particular occasion the Respondent “put his private in my bottom” (T21 lines 34 and 57). The following evidence was being given at T22 lines 29-55: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q When he put his private in your bottom did you feel anything? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did it cause you anything when that happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q How long did that go on for? 
         
        
        
         
         A Long time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did you say anything to  
         [ 
         the accused 
         ] 
          when that was happening? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did he say anything to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did he stop doing that? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q When he stopped doing what he was doing to you … what happened next? 
         
        
        
         
         A Nothing happened.” 
         
        
       
     40 During the course of her cross-examination the complainant’s attention was directed to the interview she had given to the police and the following evidence was given at T46 lines 8-25: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q … do you remember being asked how many times has [the accused 
         ] 
          put his private in your bottom? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And do you remember answering ‘Lots of times’? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Now earlier today the other gentlemen or perhaps I should say the gentlemen who was asking you questions 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q asked you a question concerning the word ‘heaps of times’ and you said that heaps of times referred to the incidents that you’ve given evidence of in this court case? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And you say that’s the truth do you? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes.” 
         
        
       
     41 The reference to the terminology “heaps of times” is a reference to the following passage in the course of the complainant’s examination in chief T32 lines 15-25: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q When you gave your evidence yesterday you said that [the accused] had done things to you heaps of times. 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q When you say ‘heaps of times’ do you mean the three times that you’ve told us about … 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Or do you mean other times as well as those times? 
         
        
        
         
         A The three times that I told you.” 
         
        
       
     42 We can see no reference of the character which the Crown Prosecutor was asserted to have been made on the previous day. Presumably a transcript was not available. The words “heaps of times” were used in answer to a quite different question at T15 lines 1-4: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q When you were eight did he visit your house a few times or many times are you able to say how often he called at your home. 
         
        
        
         
         A Heaps of times.” 
         
        
       
     43 Nevertheless, it appears in error, the Crown Prosecutor returned the next day to the turn of phrase which was subsequently picked up and used in the cross-examination of the complainant by counsel for the Appellant. 
      
       
     44 After counsel addressed, the Crown Prosecutor made the following submission to the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour Mr Segal addressed the area of evidence he pointed up to the jury that the complainant child said that the accused had penetrated her anally lots of times and pointed out there was an inconsistency on the statement against what she gave in evidence. I suppose it’s capable of the construction that penetration of her in a given incident, the incident which she gave evidence of was repeated penetration and in the excerpt of the statement Mr Segal relied upon it is not necessarily inconsistent with the version that she’s given on her oath.” (T161 line 55-T162 line 6) 
         
        
       
     45 His Honour pointed out that no such suggestion was put to the witness that her evidence may have referred to repeated penetration on the one occasion. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well no the question is ambiguous, I must admit it hadn’t, until Mr Crown mentioned it to me now I hadn’t even contemplated the possibility that that’s what she was talking about, then when I read I think it is possible.” (T162 lines 30-34) 
         
        
       
     46 His Honour indicated that even though the matter had not been put to her, it was a possible interpretation and he indicated that he intended to tell the jury that “it’s simply a possibility”. 
      
       
     47 In the course of the summing-up his Honour referred to the third of four inconsistencies on which Counsel for the Respondent had relied in the following terms (T42-43): 
      
       
        
         
         “The third inconsistency that he points to is that [the complainant] was taken to the police on 13 March 1997 when she told Detective Edmondson that [the accused] had put his penis in her bottom lots of times. Now you remember that he put that to her when he was cross-examining and she said she did say that. And yet in her evidence she said that there were only three occasions when he sexually interfered with her at all and only one occasion when he put his penis in her bottom. And again Mr Segal says to you well look that is inconsistency, that would cause you to be concerned about her evidence.” 
         
        
       
     48 Subsequently, when his Honour interrupted his summing-up, the Crown Prosecutor drew his Honour’s attention to the fact that he had not directed the jury on this matter as he had intended. His Honour said that he had forgotten to do so. Counsel for the Appellant objected to any such direction on the additional basis that if it were made at the conclusion of the summing-up it could be given undue weight. 
      
       
     49 When the jury returned his Honour indicated to them that he would add some matters to his summing-up. He said that the jury “should not give these matters any more importance than anything else that I have said”, noting the tendency that when things are mentioned out of context that they may be given greater importance than otherwise might be the case. He nevertheless proceeded to direct the jury in the following terms at T55: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I think you took to the evidence of [the complainant] when she was cross-examined she agreed that she had told the police that [the Accused] – or she was asked the question ‘How many times did [the Accused] put his private in your bottom?’ and she said ‘Lot’s of times’ and she agreed that that what she had said to the police. And I point out to you that it is possible to explain that in the sense of the penis going in and out on the one occasion, in other words the question and answer are ambiguous. 
         
        
        
         
         Of course it could mean that it is just totally inconsistent when she says that he put his private in her bottom lots of times and in court she has only said it occurred once and sexual impropriety only occurred three times. But it is possible to explain that in a way on the basis of saying well ‘How many times has [the Accused] put his private in your bottom?’ Answer ‘Lot’s of times’ meaning on the one occasion it went in and out lots of times.” 
         
        
       
     50 This was the second last matter in his Honour’s summing-up. The last was the passage already extracted above, concerning the verdict by a direction. Accordingly, the last two matters left to the jury were matters which tended to denigrate the Appellant’s submissions concerning the credibility of the complainant. 
      
       
     51 The proceedings in this criminal trial were of a character which occurs frequently. By reason of the circumstances in which the alleged offences were said to have occurred, and by reason of the delay in the complaint, there was no independent evidence verifying or corroborating the complainant’s version. Cases of this character have long posed special problems for the administration of criminal justice. There is a conflict between the public interest that perpetrators of such criminal offences are brought to justice notwithstanding the difficulties of proof, on the one hand, and the public interest that alleged offenders receive a fair trial, on the other hand.  
      
       
     52 Common law judges, with periodic statutory intervention, have long grappled with various issues arising in such a context, including the need for corroboration, the inferences available from a failure to complain, the effects of delay and the implications of a mixture of acquittals and convictions. All of these issues arise by reason of the ineluctable core of a fact finding task in cases of this character: Does the complainant’s evidence satisfy the jury that the offences charged were committed beyond reasonable doubt? Frequently, as in this case, the alleged perpetrator gives evidence. Such are often referred to as “word against word” cases. That description, of itself, fails to reflect the proposition that a criminal accused does not have to prove anything. The issue is whether or not the complainant is to be believed to the criminal standard. 
      
       
     53 The jury which is required to determine this matter is entitled to draw on the full range of logic, instinct and experience that is pertinent for the assessment of the credibility of a particular witness. In particular, the jury, performing its constitutional functions as the trier of fact, is entitled to base its final judgment in this respect on impression. The ultimate judgment may not be possible to explain or justify in terms of the kind of logical argument in which lawyers indulge.  
      
       
     54 Jurors are not required to think like lawyers when they determine issues of credibility. It is regrettable that many directions which the courts have determined must be given to juries, as well as many issues to which juries are required by statute to attend, notably by the Evidence Act, are framed in terms that could only be devised by lawyers and which, in our opinion, are liable to distort a lay fact-finding process. Nevertheless, it remains desirable, particularly in a context where criminal proceedings turn entirely on the credibility of a single witness, that a trial judge does not constrain or direct the jury’s thought processes, unless manifestly required to do so. In particular, a trial judge should refrain from giving the jury directions which suggests that they should think like lawyers. 
      
       
     55 In the present case, both of the issues that have arisen were of a character that could have been put by the Crown as a suggestion to the jury. In neither case was there any necessity for the trial judge to say anything to the jury. There was no suggestion of any unfairness to the Crown in the way the case was conducted. Nor was there any other reason for the trial judge to put an argument not advanced by counsel. (see e.g. R v Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 at 393). 
      
       
     56 With respect to the count that was withdrawn from the jury, counsel for the Appellant had indicated prior to making submissions that he proposed to refer to this as an example of inconsistency. It was a matter for the Crown whether it wished to direct the jury’s attention to the possibility that the complainant had simply forgotten to give that evidence. There was no occasion which called for his Honour to direct the jury in that way.  
      
       
     57 The result was that one of the matters going to the issue of credibility was subject to the particular force of a direction from the judge in a manner unfavourable to the Appellant. 
      
       
     58 With respect to the explanation of the phrase “lots of times”, this was plainly raised in cross-examination by counsel for the accused. No re-examination occurred to explain the sense in which the words were used. If the Crown wished to advance to the jury the possibility that “lots of times” may have been a reference to multiple acts of penetration on the one occasion - assuming that was open in the absence of re-examination - this was a matter that the Crown could have advanced by way of submissions. Nothing in the conduct of the case for the accused called for any balancing direction on the part of the trial judge in this regard. 
      
       
     59 In each of the two respects of which complaint is now made, the intervention of the trial judge urged upon the jury a particular mode of thought. His Honour suggested that there could have been an explanation for the deficiency in the complainant’s evidence, of a character which was not of itself based on any evidence but which, to a legal mind, would appear to be in each case a logical possibility. Juries are not required to think like that. 
      
       
     60 The fact that each of these ‘possibilities’ was put to the jury by the trial judge, rather than by the Crown, may have directed that the jury’s collective mind in assessing credibility in a particular way. Specifically, the thrust of the trial judge’s directions, on each of the two occasions, was that, notwithstanding the appearance of inconsistency in each of the two respects, there was a possible explanation. Such matters of speculation, whilst perhaps appropriate for counsel, should not receive the added weight of the intervention of the judicial officer. In each respect the jury could have understood the trial judge to be suggesting that, because there may have been an explanation as a matter of logic, they should not take these matters into account in determining the credibility of the complainant. 
      
       
     61 In the event, in our opinion, the directions to the jury were, in a critical respect, lacking in the appropriate balance. In our opinion Grounds 6 and 7 should be upheld.  
      
       
        
       Acquittal or New Trial 
        
       
     62 With respect to the count on which he was acquitted the Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years commencing on 20 May 1999 and expiring on 19 May 2002. The non-parole period of 18 months expired on 19 November 2000. The Appellant was released to parole and has been at liberty since that time. 
      
       
     63 If the Court were to order a new trial it would be limited to one of only three counts on which he originally stood trial. In any new trial the Appellant would be denied the forensic advantage that he acquired by being able to show elements of inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence.  
      
       
     64 First, he would not by able to highlight the failure of the complainant to give evidence, with respect to Count 2 which led to the verdict by direction. Furthermore, as a practical matter, no cross-examination would be directed to the inconsistency between the police statement with respect to Count 1, on which he was acquitted, and the evidence adduced at the first trial.  
      
       
     65 Accordingly in any new trial the Appellant would be denied the ability to challenge the complainant’s credibility in two respects on which he was able to rely in the first trial. 
      
       
     66 Finally, the Court must consider the probable transformation in the evidence of the complainant in any new trial. The events alleged in Count 3 were said to have occurred in January 1997 at a time when the complainant was not quite nine years old. She has subsequently been involved in a number of occasions in which she recited the events that allegedly occurred at that time. This included conversations with her parents, with the police and the giving of evidence in court. She would be called back to give evidence, if there were a new trial, as a fifteen or sixteen year old. The nature of the evidence she would give would, in our opinion, not have the same quality as at the previous trial, which occurred almost three years ago.  
      
       
     67 There is a very real risk that she would be unable to distinguish between her memory of the actual events and her memory of the subsequent occasions on which she recounted the events. She may well give her evidence with a greater degree of assuredness based on her increased age and a recollection of her earlier evidence and statements. It is quite likely that cross-examination would not be able to successfully challenge her evidence on any such basis. 
      
       
     68 By s6(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 this Court shall, if it allows an appeal, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered but must do so “subject to the special provisions of this Act”. One of the special provisions is s8 which allows the Court to order a new trial if the Court considers that any miscarriage of justice that occurred “can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make”. We are not of that view. We do not believe that the miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by a new trial. In our opinion we should direct a verdict of acquittal. 
      
       
        
       Order: First Trial 
        
       
     69 The order of the Court will be: 
      
       
        
       1. That the conviction of the appellant in respect of Count 3 should be quashed, and the sentence set aside. 
        
        
       2. A verdict of acquittal in respect of Count 3 should be entered. 
        
        
       The Crown case in the second trial 
        
       
     70 There were two charges against RTB at the second trial, each expressed in the same terms, namely (omitting formal parts): 
      
       
        
         
          
          For that between 17 January 1997 and 8 March 1997 at Dubbo he did commit an act of indecency with (Elizabeth), she being a person under the age of 10. 
          
         
        
       
     71 The complainant (Elizabeth) was born on 17 January 1992. At the time of each incident she was five years old. At the time of the trial she was seven. 
      
       
     72 Elizabeth gave evidence by video link. She said that RTB was minding her brothers and sisters whilst her parents were out. Both she and RTB were in her parents’ bedroom. She left the bedroom to return cigarettes belonging to her mother obtained from the kitchen. She returned to the bedroom and, soon after, RTB pulled down his shorts. He exposed his penis. Elizabeth then said this: “He made me lick his private part.” She said she did so, keeping her mouth closed, except for her tongue. 
      
       
     73 Shortly after, on the same day, there was a further incident giving rise to the second charge. It was described by Elizabeth in these words: “He made me play with his rude part with my right hand.” 
      
       
     74 According to her evidence, RTB told her not to tell her mother or father. However, upon their return to the house, she said that she immediately did so. Her father gave evidence that, a day or two after RTB had minded the children, Elizabeth said that she had a secret. She then told him that RTB “made me lick his private”. 
      
       
     75 Evidence was given by one of Elizabeth’s older sisters. She was born in 1989. She was therefore three years older than Elizabeth. She gave evidence of an occasion when she saw RTB and Elizabeth together in her parents’ bedroom. She said that she was able to see into the room because the door was open. In this respect her testimony differed from Elizabeth who said that it was closed. The older sister said that RTB was wearing jeans and they were down around his ankles. She described him as kneeling beside the bed with her sister on the bed. She said that she heard RTB say: “(Elizabeth) touch and play with my private.” She said that she stood at the door for some minutes before returning to her brothers and sisters. 
      
       
        
       Prior consistent statement. 
        
       
     76 When Elizabeth was cross examined it was repeatedly suggested that she was making her evidence up. She was asked a number of times whether someone had told her to make it up. The cross examination, for instance, included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Q. Has somebody told you to say these things about (RTB)? 
          
         A. No. 
          
         … 
          
         Q. Has your Dad said to say things about (RTB)? 
          
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     77 The Crown, in these circumstances, made an application under s108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 to call evidence in respect of a prior consistent statement of the complainant. Section 108(3)(b) is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “s108(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) … 
         
        
        
         
         (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion; 
         
        
        
         
         and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
         
        
       
     78 The issue of whether leave should be given was debated with counsel. His Honour then gave leave. At the same time his Honour said that he would limit the use to which the evidence could be put under s136 of the Act. A police constable who took a statement from the complainant then read to the jury paras 12 to 84 of that statement. Immediately following that evidence his Honour gave the following direction to the jury: (T52) 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence that has just been given about the statement that (Elizabeth) made to the police officer, is admitted for a particular purpose and the purpose for which it is admitted is this. It is admitted in relation to the credit, that is whether you believe (Elizabeth). It’s not admitted as proof of the truth of what she actually said in the statement. If you think about it for a moment, what a person complains about doesn’t get better because they complain to 10 people.” 
         
        
       
     79 His Honour added: (S/U 52-53) 
      
       
        
         
         “But you’ll recall that it was suggested to (Elizabeth) in cross examination that she had made all this up, and because that was suggested it is then open to the Crown to educe evidence of this statement that she’d made allegedly a few days after the events occurred. In order for you to assess whether she’s telling the truth or not and that is the reason why that evidence was admitted and that is the way that you should take it into account.” 
         
        
        
       The Notice of Appeal 
        
       
     80 Again the Notice of Appeal was discursive. The complaints made by the appellant, in substance, were as follows: 
      
       
     · First, that leave under s108(3) of the Evidence Act should not have been given to call evidence of the prior consistent statement. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · Secondly, that in giving leave, his Honour did not give consideration to s192(2) of the Act, and the issues which that section raises, whereas he was obliged to do so. 
      
       
        
         
        
       
     · Thirdly, that even if it were appropriate to give leave, the evidence should not have been adduced in the form in which it was given. 
      
       
     81 Each of these issues will be dealt with in turn. 
      
       
        
       Leave under s108(3) 
        
       
     82 Under s108(3) there are a number of preconditions which must be met before the issue of leave arises. First, it must be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that the evidence is fabricated, reconstructed, or is the result of suggestion. 
      
       
     83 Secondly, the evidence in respect of which leave is sought, must be characterised as a “prior consistent statement”. Issues may arise as to whether the prior statement travels beyond matters in respect of which there have been suggestions of fabrication, reconstruction or suggestion. 
      
       
     84 Here, there can be no doubt that both preconditions were met (as counsel for the appellant acknowledged). His Honour provided a judgment, when giving leave, which included the following: 
      
       
        
         
         “There can be no doubt that it was suggested both expressly and by implication that the evidence given by (Elizabeth) was fabricated and reconstructed and was the result of suggestions. Mr Cooley as I understand the situation did not contend otherwise and certainly any reading of the transcript would indicate that he had in fact suggested that to (Elizabeth).” 
         
        
       
     85 The appellant suggested that the statement should not have been admitted because it was not spontaneous. It was made approximately one week after the alleged incident. However, the section does not require that the statement should be spontaneous; simply that it be prior and consistent. 
      
       
     86 The real complaint of the appellant was that his Honour did not, in terms, advert to s192(2) of the Evidence Act when considering whether leave should be given under s108(3). Section 192(2) is in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “s192(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought; and 
          
         
        
       (d) the nature of the proceeding; and 
        
        
         
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     87 That section has been the subject of comment by the High Court in Stanoevski v R 177 ALR 285 where Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ said this: (at 294) 
      
       
        
         
         “In addition to matters which may be relevant in a particular case, in all cases the court must take into account the matters prescribed by s192(2). It is clear here that the trial judge (probably because his attention does not seem to have been drawn to it) did not take into account all of those matters, some of which would inevitably have been relevant to the way in which his discretion ought to be exercised had he adverted to them.” 
         
        
       
     88 The Court is not saying, of course, that it is necessary to refer to the section number. What is required, before leave is given, is that the issues relevant to the exercise of discretion, including those identified by s192(2), are considered. The terms of the judgment may make it obvious that such matters have been taken into account. Even where the judgment is silent, it may be apparent that a particular matter was taken into account, either because of the argument which preceded judgment, or because the matter is so obvious as to not require statement. 
      
       
     89 Where there is a failure to have regard to matters relevant to the giving of leave, including matters identified by s192, ""a wrong decision"" on a ""question of law"" will have been made (s6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912). The conviction, in those circumstances, cannot stand, unless the prosecution can establish that the conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice (Stanoevski v R (supra) McHugh J at para 55; Hayne J at para 67; R v Esho [2001] NSWCCA 415 at paras 91-109). 
      
       
     90 Here, the admissibility of the complainant’s statement to the police was debated at some length. His Honour provided a judgment which canvassed the issues. Each of the matters identified by s192(2) was, in our view, considered. First, although there is no express reference to the question of time (cf s192(2)(a)), his Honour was provided with a copy of the proposed evidence. The statement was short. It dealt with the same issues raised by the complainant’s evidence. It did not give rise to collateral issues. It was obvious that time was not a material consideration. 
      
       
     91 Secondly, his Honour expressly referred to the issue of fairness. He recognised that an attack had been made upon the credibility of the complainant. The nature of the attack gave the prosecution the right to seek leave under s108(3)(b) to enhance her credibility. His Honour also considered the issue from the viewpoint of the accused. He referred to Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 where Gleeson CJ and Hayne J dealt with the need, in some cases involving complaint evidence, to limit the use that can be made of that evidence. As mentioned, before admitting the evidence, his Honour determined that it was appropriate, under s136 of the Act, to direct the jury that the statement could only be used in assessing the credibility of Elizabeth (cf s192(2)(e)). 
      
       
     92 Thirdly, his Honour's judgment, when admitting the evidence, did not expressly deal with the importance of the evidence (cf s192(2)(c)). However, it is plain from the argument which preceded the judgment that the statement was regarded as important in assessing the credit of the complainant, it having been put to her that her evidence was fabricated or the result of suggestion. 
      
       
     93 Finally, in terms of the issues raised by s192(2)(d), his Honour was obviously aware of the nature of the proceedings, and that he was dealing with an issue of complaint in a sexual case. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “It seems to me in this case it would be proper to give leave to the Crown to adduce the evidence of the prior statement, that is the prior consistent statement made to the police by (Elizabeth), for the purpose of re-establishing or buttressing the credit of (Elizabeth).” 
         
        
       
     94 His Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         “… it does seem to me having regard to the proximity between the alleged events and the date of the statement and the contents of the statement and the close similarity between those contents and the evidence that (Elizabeth) gave in Court that this is a proper case where leave should be given to adduce evidence of the prior consistent statement. And I grant such leave.” 
         
        
       
     95 There was, in our view, no error in giving the prosecutor leave under s108(3). Accordingly, the issue of whether the prosecution can establish that there was no miscarriage of justice does not arise. 
      
       
     96 Was the form in which the evidence was given unacceptable? Again, the issue was discussed with counsel then appearing for the appellant. His Honour indicated, appropriately, that he believed it unfair to allow the Crown simply to tender the written statement. He thought the jury may attach too much weight to a written document. Rather, the evidence should be given by the police officer reading those parts of the statements which were relevant. In this context counsel for the appellant indicated his preference. He said this: (T49) 
      
       
        
         
         “COOLEY: Your Honour perhaps if I can state at the outset what I would prefer to done is to just for the statement to be read it is in question and answer form and it is important to understand the context of the answers by looking at the questions that are posed in that statement. My recollection and I’m just going through it again now is that there’s nothing in that statement your Honour that is extraneous to these proceedings if I can put it that way.” 
         
        
       
     97 The statement was then examined by the Crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant. Counsel for the appellant then said this: (T49) 
      
       
        
         
         “COOLEY: Your Honour I have no objection if it’s read from question 12 through to 84.” 
         
        
       
     98 The evidence was then given by the police officer reading out paragraphs 12 to 84. We see no unfairness in that course. We do not believe it is open, on appeal, for the appellant to now complain that some other course should have been followed (Rule 4, Criminal Appeal Rules). 
      
       
        
       Order: Second Trial 
       
     99 The order in respect to the second trial is that the appeal should be dismissed.

      REGINA v JEFFREY CHARLES FRY 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: This is an appeal against conviction. The appellant was charged before a jury in the District Court with two counts of indecent assault in aggravated circumstances. The aggravated circumstances were that the complainant was a child under the age of ten years of age. In fact, he was aged five years. The appellant was aged thirty years at the time. 
      
       
     2 Count 1 alleged that between 1 July 1998 and 4 October 1998 the appellant placed his penis against the bottom of the complainant. This was alleged to have occurred in the bedroom of the appellant. 
      
       
     3 Count 2 alleged that between 1 July 1998 and 4 October 1998 the appellant placed his penis in the mouth of the complainant. This was alleged to have occurred in the lounge room of the complainant. 
      
       
     4 The Crown supplied particulars of the offence to the appellant at the trial. In those particulars the Crown alleged that there were a further ten occasions when the appellant placed his penis in the mouth of the complainant and in the bottom of the complainant. According to these particulars five of these occasions occurred at the complainant’s home and five occurred at the appellant’s home. This additional sexual activity was said to be relevant as relationship evidence. 
      
       
     5 Essentially, the sole material evidence against the appellant was that of the complainant. The appellant did not testify. The Crown case depended on the jury’s view of the credibility of the complainant. 
      
       
     6 The appellant was found guilty in respect of Count 1 and acquitted on Count 2. 
      
       
     7 There were a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant. 
      
       
     8 When testifying in Court the complainant said that the conduct of the subject of Count 1 occurred in the appellant’s bedroom. Initially, however, he told the police that the relevant conduct occurred in the appellant’s lounge room. 
      
       
     9 When the complainant first testified he said in regard to the “first occasion”, the appellant put his penis into his mouth five times and in his bottom five times. This was consistent with the particulars of the offence as provided. Later, in his evidence in chief, he said that the appellant had done this to him on ten occasions, that is, at the complainant’s home. 
      
       
     10 In regard to the second count the complainant said that the appellant had put his penis into his mouth on the first occasion at the appellant’s home and said that this occurred five times. Again, this was in accord with the particulars of the offence. Later, however, in his evidence in chief, he said that the appellant had put his penis into his mouth and also into his bottom and that this occurred at the home of the appellant. Additionally, he said that this had occurred ten times. 
      
       
     11 The day before the trial the complainant had told the Crown Prosecutor that, in regard to Count 2, the appellant had only put his penis into his mouth and the complainant made no reference to the appellant putting his penis into his bottom. He made a similar statement to the police. 
      
       
     12 Later, in his evidence in chief, the complainant said that in regard to the sexual activity that occurred at the appellant’s home, that is the second count, the appellant had put his penis into the complainant’s mouth ten times and into his bottom ten times. The confusion in regard to the number of times this sexual activity was alleged to have occurred was compounded by the fact that, prior to the trial, the investigating police officer had asked the complainant how many times the appellant “had done this to you” and the complainant had replied “Nine”. 
      
       
     13 Notwithstanding these discrepancies the jury, as I have said, convicted the appellant on the first count but acquitted him on the second count. At first sight these verdicts are inconsistent with each other having regard to the fact that the Crown case depended, as I have said, on the veracity of the complainant and the discrepancies in his evidence related both to the first count and the second count. 
      
       
     14 The Crown sought to explain the different verdicts by submitting that the inconsistency in relation to the second count was as to the sexual activity itself, whereas for the first count it was as to the precise place where it had occurred. 
      
       
     15 It was submitted that in view of the differing account which the complainant had given about the sexual activity in regard to the second count, the jury may well have felt that it was safer not to convict on that count. The jury could have considered that the complainant was confused as to that incident. It was said that it did not follow that he was necessarily an unreliable or untruthful witness and the jury ought to have so regarded him when considering his evidence as to the first count. 
      
       
     16 I do not agree, however, with these submissions. The inconsistencies as to the first count were serious. Not only did they involve the place of the occurrence but the number of sexual acts of which the charged act formed part. In my view, there was no real difference between the quality of the inconsistencies in regard to the first count and those in regard to the second. 
      
       
     17 A leading authority in relation to the adverse impact of inconsistent verdicts is Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. To paraphrase the judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ (at 453) in that case, the jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to both counts in the indictment. 
      
       
     18 Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of the events which were said to give rise to that count. There are a number of possibilities which may have led to the jury acquitting the appellant on the second count. Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury’s rejection of the complainant’s account on the second count diminished his overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of his evidence concerning the incident, the subject of the second count. 
      
       
     19 It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first count. There is nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that his evidence was more reliable in relation to the first count than it was in relation to the second count. 
      
       
     20 Moreover, the lack of any corroborative evidence and the youth of the complainant made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise his evidence with considerable care. 
      
       
     21 In my opinion the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492 requires the conviction of the appellant to be set aside on the basis that it was unsafe and unsatisfactory. Given the jury’s finding on the second count, it was not open to them, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the first count. 
      
       
     22 Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant, with respect to the second count, lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first count wore a different complexion. For it meant that, when his evidence could be set aside against other reliable evidence it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. 
      
       
     23 Accordingly, I would set aside the conviction on the first count and order that a verdict of acquittal be entered. 
      
       
     24 BELL J: I agree. 
      
       
     25 SMART AJ: I also agree. 
      
       
     26 IPP AJA: That will be the order of the Court.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
      
       
     2 WOOD CJ AT CL: On 19 April 2001 the respondent/applicant (hereafter referred to as the “the respondent”) was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing three counts of making false or misleading statements contrary to s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and a fourth count of being knowingly concerned in the making of a false and misleading statement contrary to s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and s 1308(2) and s 1311 of the Corporations Law. The respondent pleaded not guilty to each count and stood his trial before a jury and Acting Judge Stewart. On 29 May 2001, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the fourth count, but were unable to reach agreement in respect of verdicts on the other 3 counts. The offence for which the respondent was to be sentenced carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. 
      
       
     3 On 13 July 2001, without proceedings to a conviction, his Honour discharged the respondent upon his giving security in the sum of $10,000 by recognizance to comply with the condition that he be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years commencing on 13 July 2001. Such a sentence was authorised by s 19B(1) of the Crimes Act  (Cth). By notice dated 9 August 2001, the Crown appealed under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act against what is asserted to be the inadequacy of this sentence. 
      
       
        
        
        
       Annexure A  
        
       
     4 The respondent belatedly seeks leave to extend the time in which to lodge an appeal against conviction. That application was filed on 9 October 2001, following an earlier adjournment of the proceedings, which had been listed on 4 October 2001, for hearing of the Crown appeal against sentence. As finally settled, the respondent wishes to advance submissions to the effect that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         (a) the trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately with respect to the constituents of an offence pursuant to s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) there was no evidence adduced by the Crown with respect to any participation by the (respondent) in the preparation or lodgement of … the return dated 24 July 1995 lodged by Mr Harris with the Australian Securities Commission.” 
         
        
       
     5 The charge in respect of which the respondent was found guilty by the jury was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “that the respondent on or about 24 July 1995 at Wauchope, New South Wales, contrary to Sections 1308(2) and 1311 of the Corporations Law and Section 5 of the Crimes Act 1914, was knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence by Russel Gordon Harris (Harris) against section 1308(2) of the Corporations Law, namely in a document lodged with the Australian Securities Commission, being a notification of Allotment Form 207, the said Harris made a statement which was false and misleading in a material particular, namely that 908,400 one dollar shares in Timberland Community Enterprises Limited had been allotted for cash, when that number of one dollar shares in that company had not been allotted for cash knowing the statement to be false and misleading.” 
         
        
        
       A. FACTS 
        
       
     6 The alleged offence arose during 1995 in the course of the respondent’s dealings with the Hastings Municipal Council in respect of a tender for the lease of a theme park known as Timbertown. The Council had previously administered the park but wished to obtain capital investment in the enterprise from private sources.  
      
       
     7 The respondent was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a public company, Timbertown Community Enterprises Limited (TCEL). This was a company incorporated in March 1995 specifically for the purpose of bidding for the Timbertown lease. It was made up of a number of local investors who were interested in securing management of the park in the hands of local interests. Negotiations with the Council were primarily conducted by the respondent in his capacity as chairman of the board.  
      
       
     8 The Council was concerned that the successful tenderer would have sufficient funds to enable the re-opening of the park and its successful operation in the future. It was estimated that funds in the order of $700,000 would be required for this purpose. TCEL sought to obtain the necessary funds by a public subscription for shares at one dollar each. The respondent introduced a man named Trevor Bell into TCEL. He was said to have had connections with a finance company which was involved in other community corporate ventures and which would be able to finance investors in TCEL. At his instigation a round robin scheme was adopted as a result of which shares were allocated to corporate investors without payment of capital funds.  
      
       
     9 The first three counts on the indictment related to representations concerning the funds which TCEL had available to it. The existence of these charges can be placed to one side, in view of the fact that the jury were unable to agree upon verdicts. The respondent’s case is to be considered in the light of the particular offence of which he was convicted, although within the evidentiary context which led to its commission: The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 at 392. 
      
       
     10 The Council resolved to offer the lease to TCEL subject to the fulfilment of a number of preconditions, including that the company have a minium paid-up share capital of $700,000, that a certified copy of the share register be provided to the Council, and that the issue of shares and the signing of the lease occur simultaneously. The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) issued an interim “stop” order in relation to the original prospectus and a replacement prospectus was issued on 29 July 1995. Paid-up shares were reallocated accordingly. At this time the amount of actual cash available to TCEL was in the order of $300,000. 
      
       
     11 The solicitors for the Council wrote to TCEL’s legal representatives stipulating that prior to the execution of the lease they had to sight written evidence that the company had available to it cash totalling at least $700,000. As a consequence of these requirements, a letter was provided by Harris, the accountant, to the Council, bearing the date 24 July 1995, advising untruthfully that he held nearly $800,000 in his trust account as representing properly subscribed funds for the purchase of the lease. There was evidence at the trial of the respondent that, in relation to this false letter, the respondent had said to Harris “I owe you one”.  
      
       
     12 It was also a prerequisite to TCEL entering into the lease that various documents be provided showing compliance with conditions imposed by the ASC. In purported conformity with these requirements, a copy of a Minute of a meeting of directors, which had been signed by the respondent as Chairman, was also provided to the Council. It included the following advice: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Allotment of shares: It was resolved to allot shares in the company totalling $907,800 each of $1.00 and that the secretary be authorized to sign the Notice of Allotment of Shares form 207 to the Australian Securities Commission. 
         
        
        
         
         Funds: It was resolved that the subscription funds be transferred to the company’s bank account. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     13 Further to finalising the purchase, Mr Harris, the company’s accountant, lodged a Notice of Allotment of Shares dated 24 July 1995 with the ASC. It was this Notice that was the subject of the charge in respect of which the jury found the respondent guilty. The respondent was to be sentenced on the basis that he had been found to have been knowingly concerned in the making of a false and misleading statement by Harris, to the effect that 908,400 one dollar shares in TCEL had been allotted for cash.  
      
       
     14 The falsity of the material provided by Mr Harris in securing the lease by TCEL, including this particular statement, was exposed in 1997 when the company experienced cash-flow problems and was unable to continue to operate the park. It was later liquidated.  
      
       
     15 The provision of the Notice to the Australian Securities Commission, it may be observed at this stage, involved more than a procedural formality. Without it there would have been no lease and the company would have been wound up. 
      
       
     16 Proceedings were commenced against the respondent and Harris in late 1999. Harris pleaded guilty before a Magistrate to three offences pursuant to s 178BB of the Crimes Act and to one offence pursuant to ss 1308(2) and 1311 of the Corporations Law. He was sentenced by his Honour Judge Gibson QC to a total of 500 hours community service, 250 hours of that being in respect of the offence under the Corporations Law. Harris had been given a discount of 35% based upon his pleas of guilty and his undertaking to give evidence against the respondent. The sentencing judge noted that the discount for the pleas of guilty resulted in a non-custodial sentence being imposed.  
      
       
        
       B. SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
        
       
     17 Shortly after the jury delivered its verdict on the fourth count, defence counsel sought and obtained an adjournment of the sentencing proceedings so that a pre-sentence report could be obtained.  
      
       
     18 On the adjourned hearing date the pre-sentence report was tendered. Under the heading “Offending Behaviour” it stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Mr Wall contends that his offence resulted solely from signing a document without checking its contents. While he accepts responsibility for having done so he denies any other complicity. 
         ” 
         
        
        
       The writer then went on to indicate that the respondent had expressed embarrassment and regret that this actions should result in his appearance before Court, given that his motivation for involvement in the project was for the betterment of the community. 
        
       
     19 The report concluded that the respondent was assessed as suitable for community service, that he was not recommended for periodic detention because of the distance from his home to the detention centre, and that supervision did not appear warranted if the court considered that a bond was an appropriate sentencing option.  
      
       
     20 Otherwise, it was shown that the respondent had been born in September 1946. He had no prior convictions and there was a large amount of evidence led both at the trial and on sentence attesting to his good character and involvement in community work. The Crown did not, and does not now, contend that the respondent was otherwise than a person of impeccable character and good standing in the community in which he lives, who had been involved over many years in a number of community organisations. 
      
       
     21 The respondent’s wife gave evidence that, as a result of some poor investments, his assets had been depleted and they were relying substantially upon a disability support pension. There was evidence that he had undergone neck surgery in 1991, and that, although he has some restrictions to his activities and at times needs to wear a neck brace, he was able to perform light work. However, his condition, it was said, might deteriorate over time. It was also shown that he suffered from hypertension, peptic ulcers and reflux. There was also some evidence as to the poor physical health of the respondent’s wife, but the sentencing judge expressly did not take that matter into account. 
      
       
        
       C. EXTENSION OF TIME TO APPEAL 
        
       
     22 As I have observed, the verdict of the jury was returned on 28 May 2001, and the respondent was sentenced on 13 July 2001. The Crown appeal was lodged on 9 August 2001, and that appeal was listed for hearing on 4 October 2001. 
      
       
     23 On that day, the court was informed that the respondent sought an adjournment for the reason that not all of the transcript was available, and for the further reason that he wished to consider whether he had any grounds himself for an appeal against conviction. The proceedings were then adjourned, although with the clear indication given by Mason P with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed, that the onus was: 
      
       
        
         
          “very firmly upon the respondent… to 
         : 
          
         (a) make up his mind; and 
          
         (b) put his own house in order to prosecute any appeal that he may be advised to bring and do (so) at the same time as the hearing of the Crown appeal against sentence.” 
         
        
       
     24 On 9 October 2001, a notice of application for an extension of time to appeal was filed, along with a notice of appeal which, somewhat unhelpfully, specified the grounds of appeal as those “to be provided upon grant of legal aid”.  
      
       
     25 An application had in fact been made to the Legal Aid Office, on 3 October 2001, in relation to an appeal against conviction. It was refused on 26 October 2001. 
      
       
     26 A limited grant of legal aid was made on 20 December 2001, after a successful appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee, for the purposes of obtaining advice as to the merits of a conviction appeal. The initial advice given by counsel was that, although there were several matters which were potentially arguable, they were not such as to provide a likelihood of intervention by the Court. 
      
       
     27 As a consequence, the Registrar was informed at a call over, on 18 February 2002, that the respondent would appear in person in relation to the conviction appeal. Otherwise, he was to be represented by counsel in relation to the Crown appeal. A document in the handwriting of the respondent, which ostensibly, although in a somewhat incomprehensible way, identified the matters upon which he wished to rely, was served upon the Crown that day, although not filed in this Court. 
      
       
     28 Subsequently, Senior Counsel who appeared before us to argue the application on 22 February 2001, indicated that there was an arguable ground which he was prepared to pursue on behalf of the respondent, on a pro bono basis.  
      
       
     29 While no grounds of appeal have been formally filed, it appears from an affidavit sworn by the respondent’s solicitor, and handed to the Court during the course of the hearing on 22 February 2002, that the matters which counsel sought to argue were the two grounds earlier noted. Also annexed to that affidavit were some written submissions concerning them. 
      
       
     30 In response, supplementary submissions have now been provided by the Crown, which had not been given the benefit of seeing the respondent’s submissions until the morning of 22 February 2002. Although invited to provide an additional submission in relation to the second ground of appeal, which involved a submission that the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported upon the evidence, no such submission has been supplied by the respondent, beyond that contained in the affidavit. 
      
       
     31 The first matter calling for determination is whether, in the circumstances outlined, the respondent should be granted an extension of time to appeal against his conviction. 
      
       
     32 In Regina v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122, Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J said at p 148: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         On many occasions it has been observed by Courts of Criminal Appeal, that intending appellants should not assume that delays in filing notices of appeal or applications for leave to appeal, and especially considerable delays, will automatically be excused. See for example R v Sunderland, R v Tyrell, and R v Waterhouse. This Court takes the opportunity to emphasise again that it should not be assumed that a failure to give notice to appeal, or notice of intention to appeal, or to furnish proper grounds of appeal within time will be excused. Certainly, where any considerable delay has occurred, exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed. This was the view expressed by Street CJ in R v Sunderland, and we think it is a proper view.”  
         (References omitted). 
         
        
       
     33 As Greg James J observed in Regina v Brehoi [1999] NSWCCA 113 at para 15 the burden which rests upon an applicant in relation to an application of this kind, will be “harder to discharge the longer any suggested matter impugning the integrity of the plea and known to the applicant is allowed to lie”. 
      
       
     34 To be taken into account in that respect is the well accepted principle of finality, noted in decisions such as Regina v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 and Regina v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 at para 31. Additionally, it is appropriate to have regard to any difficulties which are likely to be occasioned to the Crown, if a retrial is sought some time after proceedings were understood to have been brought to a finality, during which the intending appellant has sat by, without seeking to enforce his rights which he must have known he had.  
      
       
     35 It is true that s 10(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act confers an unfettered discretion on the Court to extend the time where it is just, under the circumstances, that such an order be made. Inevitably that requires that attention be given to whether or not there is, in the circumstances of the particular case, room for concern that there may have been a miscarriage of justice: see R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 per Smart AJ (with whom Studdert and Dunford JJ agreed) at paras 35 to 37 and 48; see also R v O’Donahue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397. This is because the existence of a reasonable misgiving as to whether an applicant received a fair trial according to law, will very often constitute the exceptional circumstance which would overcome the fact of delay. 
      
       
     36 Finally, as a matter of clear legal principle, I observe that since it is the appellant who contends that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he bears the onus of demonstrating that fact: Regina v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 37. To the extent to which this depends upon a resolution of matters of fact, he bears the onus of establishing the necessary facts: Regina v Ross (NSWCCA 20 April 1994). 
      
       
     37 The delay in the present case is not extreme, although in view of the strong protestations of innocence which the respondent maintains, it is difficult to understand why he did not lodge an immediate appeal, or why he waited until the eve of the Crown appeal to do anything about it. That period of inactivity remains unexplained. In relation to the subsequent period, that is between 4 October 2001 and 22 February 2002, it may be accepted that the respondent made reasonable efforts to pursue the rights which he claimed to possess, and that once he had an indication that there were arguable grounds, his legal advisors did attempt to pursue the matter. 
      
       
     38 It remains necessary, however, for the respondent to show that there is room for the existence of reasonable concern as to a miscarriage of justice in his case. Inevitably this requires some consideration of the proposed grounds for appeal.  
      
       
        
       (a) The Summing Up 
        
       
     39 In relation to count 4, his Honour emphasised, early in the summing up, that the expression “concerned” meant “involved” (Summing Up p9), a concept which he distinguished from being troubled or entertaining anxiety. A little later, he pointed out that the question for the jury was “did the accused act in a way that showed that he was knowingly concerned in the commission of” the offence which had been committed by Harris? (Summing Up p 27). He also made it clear that the Crown case on all counts was, in part, a circumstantial case (Summing Up p 27/28). 
      
       
     40 At a luncheon adjournment, in the course of the summing up, counsel for the respondent stated that the defence case, and the issues which arose, related to the submission that the relevant document had been “sent without (the respondent) seeing it”, and that he had placed “reliance upon the accountant” (Summing Up p 33). His Honour then directed the jury that this was the way in which the defence case was put (Summing Up p 36). 
      
       
     41 When directing the jury as to the first 3 counts, his Honour made it clear that the real issue was whether the Crown had proved that the accused (the respondent) knew that the statements which had been made were false or misleading. That knowledge he said must be “actual knowledge”, as to which he gave the following direction: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Knowledge is a state of mind and, as with any other state of mine (sic), it may be established by any evidence of words or acts on the part of the accused which point to or identify that state of mind. You can arrive at a decision that he had a state of mind, that he had knowledge, because that can be established by the evidence of words or acts on his part. 
         ” (Summing Up p 39-40). 
         
        
       
     42 His Honour then went on to direct the jury in relation to the count which is of relevance for present purposes, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In relation to count 4, putting it shortly, the Crown must prove that the accused was knowingly concerned in the offence committed by Russell Harris with respect to the lodging of the Notice of Allotment of Shares with the ASC. Being knowingly concerned in something involves two things. The first is that the accused was concerned – that meaning involved – in what led up to the lodging of the document – which was false, it is open to you to find – and secondly, that concern or involvement in the lodgement was done in a knowing way. That is to say he knew that that the document which was to be lodged contained a statement which was false or misleading. Exhibit AS is the document in question.”  
         (Summing Up 40-41). 
         
        
       
     43 After giving this direction his Honour summarised the evidence which was of relevance for the count, including that concerning the meeting of directors which had been held on 24 July 1995, at which the respondent had been present, and the minutes for which had been signed by him. Reference was made to the contents of those minutes, and of exhibit AS, particularly the section which stated the total number of shares which had, purportedly been issued for cash. His Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Members of the jury, the Crown’s case is, as I understand it, that by taking part in the meeting on 24 July, by signing the minutes of that meeting, and then knowing, as the Crown says he must, that these shares were said to be cash shares, and there were none issued as non-cash shares, that the accused was knowingly concerned in this offence committed by Mr Harris.  
         
        
        
         
         To be knowingly concerned in something in an offence means to do something which involves a practical connection with the offence and all that is involved in the offence. Merely to stand by with knowledge and do nothing is not to be concerned with it. But to wait or to stand by with knowledge with a view to doing something to facilitate it or to do something connected with that offence would amount to being knowingly concerned in it.  
         
        
        
         
         Those things must be done before or during the commission of the offence, by Harris in this case. You must be implicated or involved in the sense of having something to do with the offence and the offence includes all that is incidental or proximate to it.”  
         (Summing Up p 44). 
         
        
       
     44 Later in the Summing Up his Honour gave a conventional direction in relation to circumstance proof, and as to the drawing of inferences (Summing Up pages 49 to 51 and at 95), before going on to identify the circumstance upon which the Crown relied in order to establish the matters which it had to prove, concerning knowledge and involvement on the part of the respondent. 
      
       
     45 No question was raised by counsel at trial as to the sufficiency of the directions of law concerning the fourth count. Nor was objection taken to his Honour’s summary of the way in which the defence case was put, in which it was also made clear that the respondent asserted that he believed that the agreements to subscribe capital were the same thing as cash paid, or paid up capital, and that he had placed reliance on the specialist advisers.  
      
       
     46 In substance the complaint made in relation to the summing up concentrates on the use of the words “you must be implicated or involved in the sense of having something to do with the offence.” (Emphasis added). This, it was submitted, did not accord with the direction which had been given, and held to be appropriate by Kennedy J with whom Wallwork J agreed in Regina v Natesan and Subramaniam (1996) 88 A Crim R 444. 
      
       
     47 There the trial judge had given a direction in relation to a count of being knowingly concerned in the commission of offences by a company, involving respectively the import and export of certain therapeutic goods. In relation to the element of being “knowingly concerned”, his Honour had said (at 448-449): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The final element of each count that the Crown must prove against each accused is that he or she was knowingly concerned in the commission of each offence. That is knowingly concerned in the sense of participating in or having some part to play in the commission of the offence. Knowingly concerned means that the accused must have done whatever he or she did knowing that the acts constituting the offence were or were going to be committed. 
         
        
        
         
         In this regard it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that a particular accused knew all of the details of the offence that was going to be committed. For instance the Crown does not have to prove that an accused knew the precise date on which an export was to take place nor the precise quantity of the therapeutic goods that were going to the be exported or imported. It is enough if there is knowledge that an export was going to take place and that it would involve the therapeutic goods of the general description of those in fact exported or imported. 
         
        
        
         
         In summary, for either of the accused to be guilty of any count the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt, firstly, that the offence alleged in that count was committed by Galeshka and, secondly, that the particular accused was knowingly concerned in the commission of that offence in the sense that he or she participated in it or participated in some way knowing of the essential matters that constituted the offence.” 
         
        
       
     48 In the course of his reasons for judgment, Kennedy J reviewed a number of authorities which had examined the degree of connection necessary to establish an offence of aiding and abetting (usually defined by statute in terms of being directly or indirectly concerned in the commission of the principal offence), as well as those which had dealt with various statutory offences expressed in terms of the offender being “knowingly concerned” in some prohibited act.  
      
       
     49 In relation to those cases which charged aiding and abetting, it was noted that in Ashbury v Reid (1961) WAR 49, Virtue J, delivering the judgment of the court, said (at 51): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Some of the many meanings of the word ‘concerned’ to be found in the Oxford Dictionary are: 'to be in a relation of practical connexion with’, ‘to have to do with, to have a part in’, ‘to be implicated or involved in’, and ‘to have to do with something, especially something culpable’, and we think that this is the sense in which the word is used in this section. The question which a court should ask itself in determining whether an act or omission on the part of an individual comes within the terms of s 54 is whether on the facts it can reasonably be said that the act or omission shown to have been done or neglected to be done by the defendant does in truth implicate or involve him in the offence, whether it does show a practical connexion between him and the offence.” 
         
        
       
     50 His Honour then noted that: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         in Giorgianni (1995) 156 CLR 473; 16 A Crim R 163, which was concerned with s 351 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), dealing with aiders and abetters, it was said by Gibbs CJ (at 482; 169-170), that numerous cases accepted that the general principle is that a person can be convicted as a secondary party only if he had knowledge of the essential circumstances. Mason J (at 493; 177) adopted the observation of Cussen ACJ in Russell [1933] VLR 59 at 67, where, having listed various words, including ‘aiding’ and ‘abetting’ which have been used to refer to the conduct of a principal in the second degree in felony, he said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘ 
           All the words abovementioned are, I think, instances of one general idea, that the person charged as a principal in a second degree is in some way linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime, and is by his words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, such commission.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         There need not, Mason J indicated, exist any agreement or consensus between the principal in the second degree of secondary participant and the principal offender: see also, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ at 500; 182-183.” 
         
        
       
     51 In relation to these cases where there was an additional element of knowledge to be proved, reference was made to Yorke v Lucas (1985) 158 CLR 661, where Mason ACJ, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ confirmed that “there can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention”; and to Regina v Tannous (1987) 10 NSWLR 303. 
      
       
     52 In Tannous, the Court was concerned with a charge brought under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). There, Lee J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said (at 308-309): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I agree with counsel for the appellant when he submits that a mere state of mind which merely amounted to the appellant being interested in or concerned ‘about’ the venture, for whatever reason, would not be sufficient to constitute the concern of which the section speaks. The ‘concern’ to which the section speaks is not a concern personal to the appellant in the sense of being in his mind, but it is a concern which can be demonstrated objectively by reason of his association, whatever it may be, with the importation. It must be shown that he is ‘concerned in’ not just ‘concerned about the importation’. A father, learning that his son had made arrangements to import narcotic drugs into this country, might well be anxious about, interested in, or concerned abut the fact and he might evidence that anxiety, interest or concern to others. But he would not be guilty of the offence of being knowingly concerned merely from his knowledge of the importation and his state of mind arising therefrom. Before he could be convicted under the section he would have to do something to connect himself with or involve himself in the importation.” 
         
        
       
     53 Finally, his Honour noted that in Kennedy v Sykes (1992) 24 ATR 546, Nathan J in the Supreme Court of Victoria had said, in relation to the expression “knowingly concerned” (at 551): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It is obvious that where a person plays an essential part in the venture of deception or to mislead, no matter how slight or momentary that part may be, and whether by action or inaction that person becomes ‘concerned in’ the venture. I have already observed that phrase is preceded by an adverb ‘knowingly’. In my view, and having had recourse to the authorities, this requires the Crown to establish that the person involved in the venture was aware of its misleading or deceptive character or objective. It does not require proof that the actor be aware of all the mechanical details of the venture or the identity of all the participants. If he or she is aware of the general nature of the transaction, that the part played by him or her whether by positive act or omission will assist the misleading or deception then, in my view, the requirement of being knowingly concerned in is satisfied.” 
         
        
       
     54 It may be additionally observed that the various decisions cited by his Honour are on all fours with the principles expressed in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523; Pereira v DPP (1988) 63 ALJR 1, where the Court confirmed that the question “remains one of actual knowledge” and that such knowledge may be inferred from circumstantial evidence; R v Haddad (1988) 33 A Crim R 400 at 295; R v Nifadopoulos (1988) 36 A Crim R 137; R v Phil Kim Phieu Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402 where Gleeson CJ while noting that the expression “concerned” is one of general import, observed that two standard dictionaries gave as a synonym for it the word “involved” – that being the expression used by Stewart ADCJ in the present case: and R v Buckett (1995) 7 A Crim R 302 at 306 per Hunt CJ at CL. 
      
       
     55 In my view, his Honour’s summing up sufficiently dealt with the matters established by this line of decisions. Inter alia he emphasised that the Crown had to prove actual knowledge on the part of the respondent, there being no suggestion that suspicion would suffice, or that the test was other than subjective. Further, he made it plain that being concerned meant being “involved” in a way having a “practical connection with the offence and all that is involved in (it)”. When the words “having something to do with the offence” were used in the final sentence of the charge, they could only have been sensibly understood in the context of the explanation which had preceded that sentence, in particular in the context of the observation that “concerned” meant something which had a “practical connection” with the offence committed by Harris. 
      
       
     56 In my view the summing up was entirely sufficient in this respect, and I would refuse leave to extend the time for lodging of an appeal to raise this ground. 
      
       
        
       (b) Verdict Unreasonable 
        
       
     57 It was accepted, both at trial and on the application before us, that Harris had committed the offence relating to the lodgement of the notification of share allotment, to which he had pleaded guilty. However, it was submitted at trial, and again by counsel appearing for the respondent before us, that there was insufficient proof that he had been knowingly concerned in that offence. 
      
       
     58 While it was accepted that the respondent had taken part in the Director’s meeting which had authorised the preparation of that notification, it was submitted that there was no evidence to show that the authority then given was to complete and lodge the document in the way in which that was done by Harris. In essence, it was put that it had been left open to him as to the way in which he should complete it, and that if he elected to do so in a way that was false and misleading, then the terms of the minutes of the Directors meeting (Exhibit AR) were insufficient to demonstrate that the respondent had been knowingly involved or connected in that act. Put another way, it was argued that there was no causal connection shown between any authority given at the meeting, and the lodgement by Harris of a notification that was false and misleading. 
      
       
     59 Somewhat peripherally, it was also put that the inability of the jury to agree of the other counts suggested that the jury had not focused upon this aspect of the case. 
      
       
     60 In my view this submission is totally devoid of merit. It fails to take into account that the Crown case for count 4 did not depend solely upon the minute. Its case was a circumstantial case, from which the inferences as to what it was that the respondent intended that Harris should do, and what was the state of his knowledge, were to be drawn. 
      
       
     61 In this regard, it was common ground that: 
      
       
        
       (i) the Council required, as a precondition to granting the company the leases, that there be $700,000 or so in capital which had been raised by it and that was immediately available to it, to support the venture; 
        
        
       (ii) the deadline which it had set for it to be so satisfied, was 24 July 1995; 
        
        
       (iii) at the Directors meeting that day, which was attended by the respondent, and the minutes for which he signed, a resolution was passed to allot 907,800 shares in the company, each of $1, and to transfer the “ 
       subscription funds 
       ” to the Company’s bank account. A further resolution was passed authorising Harris “ 
       to sign the Notification of Allotment of Shares Form 207 to the Australian Securities Commission 
       ”; 
        
        
       (iv) the notification dated 24 July 1995 which was signed and certified as correct by Harris, which was lodged with the Commission on 1 August 1995, recorded an allotment of 902,800 shares, for each of which $1 had been paid in cash; 
        
        
       (v) in fact, by 24 July 1995, only $77,924 had been received and held in Harris’ trust account by way of subscriptions for shares in the company (a further $258,595 being deposited to the account on the following day). 
        
       
     62 The only sensible understanding of the Directors’ resolution was that a return would be lodged in accordance with the agreed allotment of shares. However had the Crown case depended on the minutes alone, a question might have remained open for consideration as to whether the resolution which had been framed was one requiring that the shares be fully paid up, with consequent ramifications for the notification which was lodged.  
      
       
     63 The answer to that question was, in my view, resoundingly answered in the affirmative, leaving no other rational inference open, when the entirety of the Crown case came to be considered. In this regard, whilst the various circumstances enunciated by his Honour were relevant for the other charges, so were they also relevant for this charge. Considered as a whole, they established the importance for the Council of it being satisfied that at least $700,000 was immediately available to the company in cash, having been raised by shareholder subscriptions, rather than promised or pledged; and that this was then evidenced by sufficient proof, including the notice of allotment (Exhibit AS), a copy of which was certified by Harris in the presence of a Justice of the Peace and lodged with the Council, and a further copy of which (with some amendments) was later lodged with the Commission (Exhibit AAV). 
      
       
     64 Inter alia the following evidence makes it crystal clear that the respondent knew and understood the requirements of the Council, and in particular its requirement that the company demonstrate that it had the requisite funds available in cash: 
      
       
        
       (i) the letter to the Council (Exhibit Y) which was signed by the respondent, and dated 6 June 1995, which confirmed the information supplied to a meeting of the works committee that day (attended by the respondent) including the fact that the capital subscriptions to the prospectus, at that date were $635,722; 
        
        
       (ii) the evidence given at the trial by Messrs Harris, Axam, Harrison, Cooper, Gilbert and Ms Poole, some of whom made a contemporary note, that the respondent had informed the meeting that day that there were sums  
       held 
        in the order of $550,00 to $600,00  
       in cash 
       ; 
        
        
       (iii) the letter dated 13 June 1995 (Exhibit AD) also signed by the respondent, to the Council, advising “ 
       that as of this morning our  
       subscribed 
        capital is approximately $700,000 
       ” (Emphasis added); 
        
        
       (iv) the evidence of Messrs Harris and Cooper that, at a meeting on 13 June, at the Council Chambers, the respondent again said that the company had $650,000  
       in cash 
        in the trust account; 
        
        
       (v) the letter dated 14 June 1995 to the respondent from the Council (Exhibit AF) confirming the conditions upon which the Council had resolved, on 13 June 1995, to offer the company the Timbertown lease, which involved a condition “ 
       that the Company have a minimum  
       paid up 
        share value of $700,000 and a certified copy of the Share Register be provided to Council 
       ” (Emphasis added); 
        
        
       (vi) the replacement Prospectus which was signed on 19 July 1995 by five directors of the company, including the respondent, (Exhibit AAH), in which it was stated that “ 
       there is only one class of share and all shares rank equally 
       ”, and that “ 
       the lease requires that the company have issued shares to 700,000 minimum paid up capital 
       ”; while the application attached to the prospectus provided for the tender of payment  
       in full  
        of $1 each per share. 
        
        
       (vii) the letter sent by the Council’s solicitors to the company’s solicitors dated 21 July 1995 (Exhibit AN), which specified that, in addition to registration of the replacement prospectus, and confirmation in writing by subscribers to the earlier prospectus, that they wished to remain as subscribers under the new prospectus, the Council would require, at the time of execution and exchange of lease documents, inter alia, the following: 
        
        
         
         “ 
         (a) confirmation that the subscribers have subscribed in compliance with the terms of the Prospectus; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a certified copy of that section of the Company Accountant’s Trust Account confirming that the sum of $700,000 minimum  
         is held 
          on account of share subscription in the Company together with a letter from the Company’s Accountant confirming that the monies in the said Trust Account Ledger  
         are held on trust 
          for Timbertown Community Enterprises Limited; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) a certified copy of the Minutes of the Directors Meeting which approved and authorised the share issue in compliance with the Prospectus. The minutes should inter alia confirm compliance with the ‘positive confirmation’ condition imposed by the ASC, confirm the allotment of shares in accordance with the subscription for a minimum of $700,000 in  
         paid up 
          share capital, confirm the execution of the tendered Share Register, confirm the execution of the tendered ASC Form re share allotment, that the ASC Form re share allotment be handed to the Company Solicitor for immediate lodgement with the ASC, and authorise the Company Accountant to  
         transfer the subscription monies 
          from his Trust Account to the Company; 
         
        
        
         
         (d) a certified copy of the Share Register; 
         
        
        
         
         (e) a certified copy of the ASC Form re share allotment; 
         
        
        
         
         (f) a written undertaking from yourself confirming that you will lodge the ASC Form as to share allotment forthwith”. 
          (Emphasis added). 
         
        
        
       (vii) In cross examination the respondent acknowledged an awareness of these conditions, from which concession it may properly be inferred that he had seen this letter; 
        
        
       (viii) the letter, dated 24 July 1995, from Harris to the Council (Exhibit AQ) which confirmed that he held in his trust account “ 
       the sum of $793,780 representing properly subscribed funds for the purchase by various parties in (the company) in accordance with its proper prospectus 
       ” and that such funds were “ 
       held in trust for 
       ” the company; 
        
        
       (ix) Harris’ evidence to the effect that he had prepared this letter after a meeting, at which the respondent had been present, during which he had specifically questioned the respondent as to how they were going to satisfy the Council of its requirements when they had in fact less than $300,000 in the trust account, and that he had shown the letter to the respondent who had replied “ 
       I owe you one mate 
       ”; 
        
        
       (x) the evidence from Mr Axam that the respondent was present at the meeting with the Council, on 24 July 1995, at which the documentation was exchanged, involving the minutes of the Directors meeting (Exhibit AR), the notification of share allotment (Exhibit AS), and the letter from Mr Harris (Exhibit AQ); 
        
        
       (xi) the evidence of other directors, mainly Messrs Ylias, Lewis and Chegwidden (who became a director later, but who had attended several meetings before taking up that position) that it had been made clear that what was required was “ 
       cash paid up 
       ”, and that the respondent had confirmed, at those meetings, that the funds required were actually held; 
        
        
       (xii) the utter incredulity, bordering on the epithet “ 
       preposterous 
       ”, attributed to it by Counsel for the Crown, of the respondent’s attempt to suggest that there was some distinction between “ 
       paid up capital 
       ” and “ 
       paid in full 
       ” on the one hand, and “ 
       paid in cash 
       ” on the other hand, a matter which could only have reflected very badly on his credibility. 
        
       
     65 There were other background circumstances placed before the jury setting the matters outlined in the full context, from the time of the initial expression of interest by the respondent and by the company, and including the subsequent negotiations. It is not necessary to refer to them, although they only add weight to the inevitable, and only rational inference which was available, concerning the respondent’s knowledge and involvement in the offence committed by Harris. 
      
       
     66 Whatever may have been the case in relation to the respondent’s knowledge prior to 13 June 1995, that being the ”closing date” for the 3 counts in respect of the which the jury could not agree, the requirement of Council, and the knowledge of what was needed in terms of capital actually paid up, was unquestioningly clear between that date and 24 July. In those circumstances nothing can be gained from the jury disagreement on the other 3 counts. 
      
       
     67 The case is certainly not one of a perverse verdict, nor, given the different considerations and arguments which arose in relation to the other counts, is the present a case where there is any room for concern that the jury had a doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, as to the proof of the elements of count 4. Indeed, a verdict of acquittal on this count would have been perverse.  
      
       
     68 In all of these circumstances I am satisfied that there properly was evidence to establish the fourth count, and that it could not be seriously argued that the verdict was not one which was reasonably supported by the evidence, as the test for that ground of appeal is now to be understood: Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 and R v Giam  (1999) 104 A Crim R 416. 
      
       
     69 Being quite unpersuaded that there was any risk of injustice, or that any reasonable argument can be raised in support of an appeal against conviction, I would refuse the application to extend the time for filing an appeal. 
      
       
        
         
           
         
        
       D. APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 
        
       
     70 The Crown contends that not only was the sentence imposed inadequate on its face, but also that the sentencing judge made a number of errors of principle in determining that it was appropriate to proceed under s 19B of the Crimes Act 1914. Before considering these submissions it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence:  
      
       
        
       (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
       House v The King 
        (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
       Dinsdale v The Queen 
        (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
       Lowndes v The Queen 
        (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
       R v Tait 
        (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
       Wong and Leung v The Queen 
        (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
        
        
       (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
       Malvaso v The Queen 
        (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
       R v Baker 
        [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
        
        
       (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “ 
       for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons 
       ”: per Barwick CJ in  
       Griffiths v The Queen  
       (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
       Everett v The Queen 
        (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
       Dinsdale v The Queen  
       (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and  
       Wong & Leung v The Queen 
        at para 109. 
        
        
       (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
       R v Allpass 
        (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
       R v Papazis 
        (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
       Wong and Leung v The Queen 
        at para 110. 
        
        
       (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
       R v Holder and Johnston 
        (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
       Dinsdale v The Queen 
        at para 62. 
        
       
     71 As I have observed, Acting Judge Stewart sentenced the respondent in accordance with the power conferred by s 19B of the Crimes Act (Cth). That section provides as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         19B 
         . Discharge of offenders without proceeding to conviction 
           
         
        
       
     (1) Where:  
      
       
       (a) a person is charged before a court with an offence against the law of the Commonwealth; and  
        
       (b) the court is satisfied, in respect of that charge or more than one of those charges, that the charge is proved, but is of the opinion, having regard to:  
        
        (i) the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, health or mental condition of the person;  
        
       (ii) the extent (if any) to which the offence is of a trivial nature; or  
        
        (iii) the extent (if any) to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances;  
         
        that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment, or that it is expedient to release the offender on probation;  
        
       
     the court may, by order:  
      
       
       (c) dismiss the charge or charges in respect of which the court is so satisfied; or  
        
       (d) discharge the person, without proceeding to conviction in respect of any charge referred to in paragraph (c), upon his giving security, with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, that he will comply with the following conditions:  
        
        (i) that he will be of good behaviour for such period, not exceeding 3 years, as the court specifies in the order;  
         
        (ii) that he will make such reparation or restitution, or pay such compensation, in respect of the offence or offences concerned (if any), or pay such costs in respect of his prosecution for the offence or offences concerned (if any), as the court specifies in the order (being reparation, restitution, compensation or costs that the court is empowered to require the person to make or pay):  
        
       (A) on or before a date specified in the order; or  
        
         
         (B) in the case of reparation or restitution by way of money payment or in the case of the payment of compensation or an amount of costs---by specified instalments as provided in the order; and  
         
        (iii) that he will, during a period, not exceeding 2 years, that is specified in the order in accordance with subparagraph (i), comply with such other conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit to specify in the order, which conditions may include the condition that the person will, during the period so specified, be subject to the supervision of a probation officer appointed in accordance with the order and obey all reasonable directions of a probation officer so appointed.  
         
        … 
        
       
     (3) Where a charge or charges against a person is or are dismissed, or a person is discharged, in pursuance of an order made under subsection (1):  
      
       
       (a) the person shall have such rights of appeal on the ground that he was not guilty of the offence or offences concerned with which he was charged as he would have had if the court had convicted him of the offence or offences concerned; and  
        
       (b) there shall be such rights of appeal in respect of the manner in which the person is dealt with for the offence or offences concerned as there would have been if:  
        
       (i) the court had, immediately before so dealing with him, convicted him of the offence or offences concerned; and  
        
       (ii) the manner in which he is dealt with had been a sentence or sentences passed upon that conviction.” 
        
       
     72 The section confers a general discretion on the court. The scope and manner of its application was recently considered by this Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky [2001] NSWCCA 332. It was there held that the application of the section should be approached in two stages: first, the identification of one or more of the factors identified in s 19B(1)(b); secondly, the determination, having regard to the factors identified, is whether one of the conclusions in the section is reached. It was further held that s 16A(2) of the Act identifies the matters that must be taken into account in exercising the second stage of the discretion. 
      
       
     73 Before the discretion can be exercised one or more of the matters referred to in the section must reasonably support a finding that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment, or to reach any of the other conclusions for which the section provides: Cobiac v Liddy (1969) 119 CLR 257 at 276; Commissioner of Taxation v Baffsky at paras 23–25. Acting Judge Stewart did not indicate precisely what matter it was within the section which meant that it was inexpedient to impose any more than a nominal punishment. None of the matters to which his Honour referred in any detail in his remarks was, in my view, reasonably capable of supporting such a finding. At the conclusion of his remarks his Honour simply repeated the ritualistic formula: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I am of the opinion having regard to your character, antecedents, age and health that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment 
         ”.  
         
        
        
       That is not a sufficient statement of the reasons justifying the exercise of the discretion under s 19B. 
        
       
     74 The Crown submits that his Honour erred, in so far as he: 
      
       
        
       (a) underrated the seriousness of the offence; 
        
        
       (b) overrated the seriousness of the punishment which he imposed; 
        
        
       (c) failed to give effect to the policy behind the legislative creation of the offence; 
        
        
       (d) failed to give effect to the element of general deterrence; and 
        
        
       (e) failed to appreciate the importance of the imposition of a conviction. 
        
       
     75 It must be said, with due respect to his Honour, and with an appreciation of the fact that the sentencing remarks were given ex tempore, that his Honour’s reasons contain a number of inconsistencies and non-sequiturs. 
      
       
     76 In relation to a Crown submission, in opposition to the matter being dealt with under s 19B, his Honour observed, at various points in his remarks upon sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The Crown Prosecutor argues against this course. She submits – and up to a point she is right – that the objective criminality of this offence is high. A lot of people did lose a lot of money as a result of what occurred and the accused is not one of them. There are pointers in his direction that if he did not do this for material gain he did it for kudos. I observe that the prisoner was not then and is not now an innocent abroad. He has had, and had at the time, considerable business experience one way and another, but he fell in with Mr Trevor Bell who had concocted what can only be described as a scheme aimed at cheating. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         ..Unfortunately, this prisoner was part and parcel of Mr Bell’s machinations and committed the offence with which I am now dealing knowingly with a substantial degree of criminality. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         ..It is true that this offence involved a breach of trust. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         ..It is also true that even today the prisoner is still trying to argue that he did nothing wrong and that he was acting for the good of the community. That is rubbish. He did something very wrong, knowing it was wrong,.. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         ..the prisoner did what he did, not openly but knowingly and he has been convicted by the jury for doing it 
         ..” 
         
        
       
     77 The Crown submission under complaint (a) above is that, despite these statements (which it would accept as correct) concerning the seriousness of the respondent’s offence, his Honour then downplayed it, when he referred to the s 178BB counts as the three more serious of the charges. I do not believe that there is any merit in this particular argument when the reference to the differing seriousness of the two categories of offences is read in context. It seems to me that his Honour was referring somewhat bemusedly to the inability of the jury to come to the conclusion concerning these the matters which were, if only for the reason that they carried a markedly higher maximum penalty, notionally more serious than the count upon which the respondent was convicted. 
      
       
     78 The force in the complaint, in my view, is rather that, having regard to these findings, it is impossible to see how his Honour could have formed the view that a discharge under s 19B was an appropriate sentence to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. Even having regard to the maximum penalty prescribed and the fact that the matter might have been dealt with by a magistrate, it is clear that his Honour could not have thought that the offence was either “of a trivial nature” or ”one that has been committed under extenuating circumstances” when determining to apply s 19B. 
      
       
     79 Quite to the contrary, his Honour appropriately identified the offence committed by the respondent as a dishonest criminal act involving a serious breach of trust, which had been committed with a full appreciation of its nature. Although the offence did not require proof of any fraud on the part of the respondent, or of a loss occasioned to any person as a consequence of his act, in determining whether to apply the discretion in s 19B, his Honour was entitled to take into account, as he did, the monetary loss resulting, at least indirectly, from the respondent’s criminal conduct: Thorneloe v Filipowski [2001] NSWCCA 213. 
      
       
     80 Unless there was some exceptional mitigating circumstance arising from the respondent’s subjective circumstances, the sentence imposed, itself, is indicative of error in light of his Honour’s assessment of the respondent’s criminality. I cannot however see anything in his Honour’s remarks or in the evidence, which would support his finding that “this is a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence” in compliance with the obligation imposed by s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act. 
      
       
     81 The Crown’s argument in relation to (b) above is based upon the following observation made by his Honour: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         My view is that a dismissal of this charge under s 19B on condition that he be of good behaviour for a period is in effect, at least as serious punishment as one of community service. I say that for three reasons: (1) The community at large and his community in particular will know that he has been placed upon a good behaviour bond for committing an offence of dishonesty. (2) That ignominy is not going to go away even though no conviction will be recorded. Despite the fact that no conviction is recorded, it is and will remain a blot on his escutcheon which he will have to wear figuratively for the rest of his days.. 
         
        
        
         
         .. 
         I do not agree this is nominal punishment… 
         ” 
         
        
       
     82 Elsewhere his Honour had said that: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “ 
         A dismissal of this charge under s 19B on condition that he [the respondent] be of good behaviour given effect in reality a more serious punishment than one of community service 
         .” 
         
        
        
       His Honour did not go on to indicate the third reason for his assessment of the seriousness of the punishment.  
        
       
     83 In my view, it cannot be seriously maintained that a discharge without conviction can ever be regarded as “at least as serious a punishment as one of community service”, let alone as a more serious punishment, regardless of what conditions may be imposed on the accompanying recognisance. 
      
       
     84 Nor do I understand how it could be said that the order made resulted in something more than nominal punishment. The fact that the offender has been required to enter into a recognizance with a condition to be of good behaviour may result in his being liable to punishment, but it does not of itself impose any form of punishment. A requirement that an offender undertake community work is a recognised form of punishment, which puts the offender to inconvenience, and reinforces both punitively and publicly the important element of deterrence. It is a non-custodial alternative to a sentence of full time imprisonment, see s 8 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) which applies to federal offenders by reason of s 20AB of the Crimes Act (Cth). As such it has considerable more force than a disposition which involves the imposition of a bond without the recording of a conviction. 
      
       
     85 Complaints (c) to (e) can be dealt with together. The Crown submits that his Honour failed to appreciate the purpose of s 1308 of the Corporations Law, the need for general deterrence, and the significance of recording a conviction in the case of the appellant. His Honour stated that he agreed with the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that the primary purpose of the section is protective. His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         ..but I take the view as I have already indicated, that the public will best be protected by placing this man on a bond to be of good behaviour, the protection lying in the fact that if he is not, he will be brought back before me and can expect no mercy.” 
         
        
       
     86 I put to one side the fact that this remark has to be considered in the context that his Honour saw little likelihood that the public needed to be protected from the offender, because his Honour took the view that it was unlikely he would re offend. However, the purpose of the section is to protect the public from the effects of false or misleading information being provided to the Commission. That objective will be seriously undermined unless there is a significant element of general deterrence reflected in the sentence imposed for a breach of the section such as that committed by the respondent, in particular because of the position he held in the company, and because of the need to ensure that information supplied to the Commission is available to creditors, investors and shareholders, and is accurate and reliable. There is no reference in his Honour’s reasons, either explicitly or implicitly, to general deterrence, and it can only be assumed that it was overlooked or considered to be of no relevance. That it is relevant for sentencing for a Commonwealth offence is well established: see Commissioner for Taxation v Baffsky at para 93. 
      
       
     87 In the context of white collar crime of this sort, there is another good reason for recording a conviction, since that would have imposed a limitation upon the respondent’s ability to commit another similar offence. He would have been disqualified from managing a corporation for the period specified by s 206(B) of the Corporations Law, now the Corporations Act 2001, a right which he had clearly forfeited by his breach of trust and act of dishonesty as an office holder of a public company. Although s 206B is not intended as a means of exacting further punishment, the recording of convictions in such cases has been recognised as having a particular significance (R v Hannes  [2000] NSWCCA 503), by reason of the restrictions to which they give rise, and also by reason of the need for general deterrence. In this regard it may be noted that in Spies v The Queen (2000) HCA 43, Gaudron J observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         ..members of the commercial community as well as the general public have a vital interest in ensuring that directors who abuse their office and breach the criminal or company law do not escape conviction.” 
         
        
       
     88 On behalf of the respondent it was argued that it was within his Honour’s discretion to take the course he did having regard to what was described by counsel as an exceptional case. The matters which were said to make the case exceptional were as follows: 
      
       
        
       (a) The delay of six years since the commission of the offence;  
        
        
       (b) The state of the respondent’s health and his age; and  
        
        
       (c) The public nature of the offence, the intention the respondent had of advancing community interests, his record for community work, the absence of personal gain and his reliance upon others. 
        
       
     89 I find that none of these matters, whether taken individually or together, amount in any way to an exceptional case, notwithstanding that the discretion is not circumscribed by a need to find exceptional circumstances. In this regard, I consider that: 
      
       
        
       (a) The delay was due principally to the delay before the offence was discovered and to the fact that the applicant pleaded not guilty. Delay in the prosecution of white-collar crimes is not unusual and the fact that they are so difficult to discover and successfully prosecute is one of the reasons why general deterrence is so important; 
        
        
       (b) The respondent’s health was a matter which may have been relevant to the form of sentence that should have been imposed but I cannot see how it was relevant to a determination that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment or only a nominal punishment. Although the respondent’s health had deteriorated somewhat over the period since the offence, it was not a significant matter justifying either alone, or in combination with other matters, the exercise of the discretion under the section; and 
        
        
       (c) There was nothing in the circumstances in which the crime was committed which the respondent could properly call in aid as a mitigating circumstance. His Honour’s findings of fact are in conflict with such a submission. A deliberate and serious act of dishonesty by a person holding office in a public company is hardly mitigated by the fact that he believed himself to have been acting in the community interest, or that he had a record of community work.  
        
       
     90 The fact that a verdict and judgment has been attained by the Liquidator of TCEL against the Respondent in the sum of $80,000 together with interest and costs, is also not a matter which the respondent can call in aid. This was not a case of voluntary reparation, there is no evidence as to whether the judgment will be met, and in any event the considerations noted by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 448 apply.  
      
       
     91 In my view the appeal against sentence should be allowed. Notwithstanding double jeopardy and the residual discretion, I would convict the respondent and sentence him to a period of community service. The sentencing judge, in my view, should have imposed a sentence of full time imprisonment, but that sentence would not now be appropriate. There would be no disparity with the co-offender in such a sentence, having regard to the fact that Harris pleaded guilty and gave assistance to the Crown.  
      
       
     92 The orders I propose are that: 
      
       
        
       (1) the application to extend the time to file an appeal against conviction be dismissed; 
        
        
       (2) the Crown appeal be allowed;  
        
        
       (3) the order of Stewart ADCJ be quashed; and  
        
        
       (4) in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced to community service for 300 hours.  
        
       
     93 BELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by Wood CJ at CL for the reasons which his Honour gives.

Additionally it orders that the respondent present himself at the Probation and Parole Service at Port Macquarie within 48 hours of the making of this order.2 It is also necessary that there be some explanation given to Mr Wall as to the effect of the order. 
      
       
     3 We do that by indicating that it requires you to perform 300 hours of Community Service; that you perform that work in a satisfactory manner; that you comply with any reasonable direction of the assigned officer or supervisor; and that you inform the assigned officer of any change in your place of residence.4 We also indicate to you that in the event of there being any failure, without reasonable cause or excuse, to comply with the Community Service Order, then that would constitute a further offence under the Act for which a fine could be imposed, not exceeding 2.5 penalty units. Alternatively, the Court could deal with you for the offence as though this order had not been made, that is to substitute some other form of sentence in relation to the matter which gave rise to the community service order or, alternatively, it could take no further action. 
      
       
     5 So there are circumstances whereby, as a result of further offences or failure to comply, action could be taken to revoke the order and to substitute some other form of sentence or alternatively, as indicated, to treat a non-compliance as an offence.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an application by Kathryn Ann Armstrong to appeal against the sentences imposed on her by his Honour Judge Christie QC in the District Court at Sydney on 20 June 2001 for a number of offences of dishonesty.  
      
       
     2 In respect of the third count, which was one of making a false instrument, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a term of 3 years commencing on 9 November 2000 and fixed a non-parole period of three-quarters of that, namely 2 years and 3 months. In fixing that sentence, his Honour also took into account a number of matters on a Form 1 and in respect of the other eighteen counts, his Honour sentenced the applicant to fixed terms of imprisonment, to be served concurrently, and expiring within the non-parole period fixed on count 2. 
      
       
     3 Without going into the details of the charges, the facts can be summarised by saying that early in 2000 the applicant and her then partner moved to premises at Iluka on the North Coast, where they “apparently” befriended their neighbours. I say apparently because the applicant used this friendship to steal a number of items from the neighbours, including a marriage certificate, credit cards, Medicare cards, an Australian Tax Office cheque and other items, and subsequently used these items to make and use a number of false instruments to deprive the neighbours of various sums of money through a number of bank accounts. One offence in particular, to which I would make special reference, was in respect of a Tax Department cheque in favour of one of the neighbours in the sum of $32.75, which the applicant fraudulently altered to a cheque for $48,832.75, and then using the false identification material previously stolen, she attempted to open an account in the name of the neighbour with the National Australia Bank and present the cheque to the credit of that account. The bank became suspicious and the whole scheme unravelled. 
      
       
     4 The matters on the Form 1, which were some six in number, involved obtaining cash from the account of another neighbour, by the forging of various cheques. 
      
       
     5 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour took into account a number of subjective matters that were before him, including some rather sad and distressing features in the applicant’s life, the effect that her recent incarceration had had on her daughter, the fact that her former partner had left her as a result of her incarceration for these matters and he said that he accepted almost every syllable in a document prepared by the applicant and which has been before us today as being demonstrative of significant subjective circumstances. He also had regard to the Corrective Services’ health report, under the hand of Dr Michael Giuffrida and a Department of Corrective Services’ Alcohol and Other Drug Report, and concluded that those matters painted a picture of a lady who is anxious to get on with her rehabilitation, is anxious to serve whatever sentence she faces and get on with her life in the company of her daughter, hopefully to repay the moneys and hopefully not to offend again. His Honour considered that she appeared to be a woman on the right track to rehabilitation. 
      
       
     6 It was also incumbent for his Honour to have regard to the applicant’s previous record, which is extensive, although his Honour noted that she appeared to be “an incorrigible and repetitive offender”, but went on to say that it is perhaps better to look to the future than to the past. He said that he was anxious not to crush her but to enable her to mend some fences and get on with her life and encourage any effort that she had so far made in terms of her rehabilitation. He took into account her pleas of guilty and her long history of drug addiction. 
      
       
     7 I should refer briefly to her prior record which, as I say, is extensive. I will not set it out in detail at this stage but she has failed to complete previous periods of supervision and been in breach of community service orders. She has a record dating back to 1986. In January 1996 she was placed on a 3 year good behaviour bond and orders were made for her to perform community service, neither of which she kept. On 10 April 1997 she was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment on a number of charges but she appealed, as was her right, and in the District Court at Lismore on 5 March 1998 she was placed on a 3 year good behaviour bond, to accept the supervision of the drug and alcohol authority and also ordered to perform community service. Again she did not adhere to the terms of the bond. These offences were committed whilst she was subject to that bond. She also received a sentence of 3 months from the Grafton Local Court on 23 March 1999. These offences commenced some time during the course of the year 2000. She had previously been given a number of recognisances with supervision. 
      
       
     8 Towards the end of his Remarks on Sentence his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having looked at the subjective circumstances and balanced them against the prisoner’s prior record, I do not feel this is a matter in which I could justifiably find special circumstances. It is not often that I do not find special circumstances but I propose to ameliorate the sentence as far as I can in terms of the subjective circumstances that present but  
         I do not believe that there is anything here that would entitle me to find special circumstances and I do not propose to do so 
         .” (my italics) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     9 The only ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in law in finding that he was not entitled to find special circumstances and that submission is based substantially on the passage in italics above. The earlier part of the passage quoted is also referred to as perhaps being ambiguous but it is submitted that the passage in italics is not ambiguous and represented an error of law. 
      
       
     10 In R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 the learned sentencing judge had said “I see no reason to find special circumstances in this case” and it was submitted that that constituted the same error of law as here. In delivering the judgment of this Court, Spigelman CJ said at [90]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Decisions on sentencing matters by District Court judges should not be analysed so finely. The suggestion of ambiguity in the applicant’s submissions is to manufacture an error in his Honour’s reasons which nothing in his Honour’s reasons warrant.” 
         
        
       His Honour went on: 
        
         
         “In my opinion his Honour’s reasons should be understood to say that all the facts and matters to which he had earlier referred did not constitute a sufficient “reason to find special circumstances”. His Honour was entitled to make a judgment of that character. No error is suggested which would entitle this Court to intervene.” 
         
        
       
     11 In my opinion, similar considerations apply here. His Honour, as I read his Remarks on Sentence, was not saying and was not intending to say that as a matter of law there were no matters which were capable of giving rise to special circumstances which would justify a non-parole period of less than three-quarters of the head sentence, but was merely saying that in all the circumstances of this case, and having regard in particular to the manner in which he had ameliorated the head sentence by reason of the subjective matters which he had found in favour of the applicant, there were no additional facts which led to a finding that a non-parole period of less than three-quarters of the head sentence was appropriate. 
      
       
     12 As pointed out in Simpson at [56] the non-parole period is “the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence” and having regard to what was said in Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 and followed in Simpson at [55] and [59], that involves a consideration not only of the subjective features of the offender but also of the objective features of the offences that have been committed, including the need for general and personal deterrence. 
      
       
     13 As also pointed out in Simpson at [67], when subjective matters are taken into account in fixing the head sentence, then merely by applying the ratio indicated by s 44(2), those subjective features are reflected in the non-parole period.  
      
       
     14 Having regard to the applicant’s prior record and including the number of times she had failed to take advantage of supervision, there was no basis in this case for believing that a longer period on parole would effect her rehabilitation any more than would the period fixed by his Honour during which she will be eligible for parole. As his Honour observed, although she was anxious to rehabilitate herself, the view was open that this represented the triumph of hope over experience. 
      
       
     15 For these reasons, I cannot see any error in his Honour’s reasoning nor in the manner in which he has expressed himself. His Honour as I say was not finding there were no matters capable of amounting to special circumstances but that in this case there were no additional matters which he had not already taken into account which amounted to special circumstances such as would justify a reduction in the non-parole period below three-quarters of the head sentence.  
      
       
     16 A number of such matters were suggested to us in oral submissions but they were all matters which had been taken into account by his Honour in fixing the head sentence. 
      
       
     17 For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentences. 
      
       
     18 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     19 DUNFORD J: The order will be as I have indicated.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application for an extension of time, and subject to that application, an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the Applicant by her Honour Judge Karpin in the District Court at Parramatta on 27 July 2000, following the Applicant’s pleas of guilty to three counts of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and drugs causing death contrary to s 52A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Her Honour sentenced the Applicant to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 6 years with non-parole periods of 3 years, 5 months to date from 28 June 2000, the day in which she went into custody in relation to these matters.2 The offences occurred on 1 August 1999 and the three victims were all passengers in the car driven by the Applicant. The facts as found by her Honour, which are not disputed, included that the Applicant was at the time of sentencing a 29 year old woman with two sons aged 8 and 6 respectively, the product of her 12 year relationship with the late Richard Fletcher who committed suicide in March 1999. Following his death the Applicant began to drink heavily and she formed a friendship with one John Howard. On the evening of 31 July 1999, she and Ms Peta Heffernan, who was living in the house with her at the time, shared a marijuana joint, after which they set off in the Applicant’s motor vehicle from their home at Ermington to join Mr Howard and three of his male friends at an establishment called the ‘Sharks Bar’ at Blacktown, the arrangement being that they would stay overnight in the Blacktown area and return the following day. The Applicant has never held a driver’s licence, she held a learner’s permit in 1996 but had not renewed it. Notwithstanding this she continued to drive her late partner’s motor vehicle and after his death had it registered in her name. 3 At the Sharks Bar the Applicant and Ms Heffernan joined the men and spent the evening drinking, dancing and apparently enjoying themselves. The Applicant was drinking bourbon and coke throughout the evening. At about 12.50 am on the morning of 1 August the group left the Sharks Bar and went to the Applicant’s car. A number of people were already in the vehicle, namely Ms Heffernan, Mr Wilson, Mr Kingy and Mr McTaish. The Applicant told Mr Howard that she thought they were going to stay in the area at a motel, but he suggested she was looking for an argument and told her to get into the car, getting into the rear seat of the car himself, thus leaving only the driver’s seat available. It was her car, she had the keys and accordingly she got into the vehicle and drove off with Ms Heffernan sitting next to her and the four males in the back, although there were only seatbelts for three of them. 4 The Applicant does not have a good recollection of what followed, but based partly on what she did recall, and partly on evidence from other persons, her Honour was satisfied that Ms Heffernan was happy, excited, affected by alcohol and was, in effect, skylarking. At one point she was kneeling up on the front passenger seat facing the back. The Applicant told her to sit down. She was of course not wearing a seatbelt. 5 After leaving Blacktown the Applicant’s vehicle was observed driving on the Cumberland Highway at Northmead by a Mrs Pontin who saw Ms Heffernan leaning out of the vehicle and waving her arms around. The Applicant’s vehicle was overtaken by Mrs Pontin’s vehicle at about 70 km per hour but immediately thereafter the Applicant’s vehicle pulled in behind Mrs Pontin’s vehicle and effectively began tailgating her vehicle at a time when both vehicles were travelling at about 70 km per hour. Subsequently the Applicant’s vehicle moved alongside Mrs Pontin’s vehicle. She wisely pulled over to the left and the Applicant’s vehicle accelerated quickly away.6 After that a number of other witnesses saw the Applicant’s vehicle travelling very fast on the Great Western Highway shortly before the accident. As the vehicle approached the intersection of Hawkesbury Road the Applicant apparently applied her brakes heavily causing the vehicle to skid with the wheels locked. She lost control of the vehicle which continued at a substantial speed, skidding out of control before it collided with a gutter, after which it continued to slide at high speed until it struck a wooden power pole at its centre pillar. Thereupon Ms Heffernan’s body was ejected through the front windscreen, the car continued to travel and a second body was ejected from the vehicle before it finally came to a stop. Ms Heffernan, Mr Howard (the two persons ejected) and Mr Kingy (who remained inside) were all killed as a result of the accident. A blood sample was taken from the Applicant after she was admitted to hospital and disclosed a reading of .133 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milligrams of blood, together with delta–9-THC0.023 milligrams per litre, and delta-9-THC0.082 milligrams per litre, that is cannabis, and less than 0.02 milligrams per litre of methylamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy.7 The opinion of Dr Perl, which her Honour accepted, was that at the time of driving the Applicant was under the influence of both alcohol and cannabis, which significantly impaired her driving ability, and although the level of methylamphetamine was low, it is possible that it could have also caused some impairment by way of fatigue. 8 I should say in fairness to the Applicant, that although she quite voluntarily and deliberately drank the alcohol and took the cannabis, there was no evidence that she voluntarily ingested the methylamphetamine, and it appears quite likely that her drink was spiked in some way.9 Her Honour noted that the Applicant was then aged 29, one of three children, that both her parents were dead and she had no contact with her siblings. She had two sons then aged 8 and 6, from her relationship with Mr Fletcher and they had been placed with Mr Fletcher’s mother in anticipation of the Applicant being sentenced to full time custody. 10 Her Honour noted the other relevant subjective features, including that the Pre-Sentence Report and references spoke highly of her dedication to her children and her friends. Her Honour went on: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is a case in which the prisoner abandoned responsibility for her own conduct when she got into the driver’s seat at a time when she was affected by both alcohol and drugs. I accept that she had not intended to drive home that night, however she had driven to the bar in her own car of which she had retained the keys. She allowed herself to be put in a position of driving simply because she perceived the possibility of confrontation if she declined to do so. She made no attempt to avoid driving.”  
         
        
       
     11 Her Honour noted the Applicant’s pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity and that there was ample evidence both of her remorse and of her general good character, and also of her specific character as a loving mother and caring friend. Because the deaths all arose out of one accident, her Honour made the sentences concurrent, and found special circumstances to assist in the Applicant’s reintegration into the community and restoration of family life following her release without the assistance of her deceased defacto. 12 The Applicant relies on a number of grounds in support of the appeal. Firstly, it is sought to rely on fresh evidence to the effect that the Applicant was pregnant at the time of sentencing and this matter was not disclosed to the sentencing judge. According to her affidavit, which we accept in this regard, the Applicant only became aware of her pregnancy after the sentencing hearing on 28 June 2000 and before actually being sentenced on 28 July 2000. 13 She also asserts that she endeavoured to bring this fact to the attention of her legal representative prior to the date of sentence but was unable to speak with him and did not see him until she was brought into Court to be sentenced, when she told him of her pregnancy but he told her that it was too late to raise the matter. 14 The admission of fresh evidence in sentence appeals will only be allowed in very limited circumstances: R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328; see also R v Fordham (unreported - CCA - 2 December 1997), and R v Swindale (unreported - CCA - 22 July 1998). We were also referred to R v Abbott (1985) 17 A Crim R 355 where this Court said that fresh evidence would be received on an appeal where it was shown that the Applicant was incompetently represented at the sentencing proceedings, and that such incompetence had brought about a miscarriage of justice.15 Without necessarily rejecting the Applicant’s evidence of what occurred between her and her legal representative on the morning the sentence was passed, I would not be prepared to make an express finding of professional incompetence against the legal representative without him having the opportunity to be heard, but in any event the Crown accepts the rest of her affidavit, and concedes that she was in fact pregnant at the time of sentencing, but submits that it would not have made any difference to the sentence.16 The Applicant relies on what was said by Matthews J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed in R v Ihm and ors (unreported – CCA – 9 January 1993), another case where fresh material was put before the Court relating to the pregnancy of one of the Applicants which, although not known at the time of sentence, was received by the Court, and the Court accepted that if the sentencing judge had been aware of it he would have treated it as a significant mitigating factor. However, what the Court did in that case was to leave the head sentence unchanged but reduce the minimum term of 9 months to 5 months, the effect of which was that the child could be born after the Applicant had been released on parole. That is not the case here as the child has already been born, and as pointed out by Carruthers AJ, with whom Hulme J agreed, in R v Clarke [2000] NSWCCA 150 at [24], the provision for mothers having children with them whilst in custody are now much more favourable than existed at the time that Ihm was decided, and the fact that a child will for some time be with its mother in custody, whilst a matter which attracts sympathy, does not affect the principles of law to be applied to the sentencing of the offender.17 It was submitted that imprisonment during pregnancy and giving birth whilst in custody must bear more heavily upon the Applicant than in the case of another prisoner, and that it would have been proper for her Honour to make some allowance if she had been aware of the pregnancy. However, there is no evidence that there is any greater burden on a female prisoner who is pregnant than there is on any other prisoner, or on any other woman who is pregnant in the community, and I therefore am not satisfied that the fact of pregnancy at the time of sentencing is a matter that would or could have affected the sentence if it had been known to her Honour at the time.18 The next ground of appeal is that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper consideration to the hardship to others following the Applicant’s incarceration, and in this regard she relied in particular on the hardship allegedly being suffered by the two children, aged 8 and 6 at the time of sentence. 19 There is an affidavit filed by the Crown by Madeline Lloyd, affirmed 20 March 2002, which states that in addition to the Applicant and her latest baby being in the Mother and Children’s Program, her two other young sons come to their mother at weekends and school holidays. 20 The general rule is that hardship to members of an offender’s family is generally irrelevant and can only be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in highly exceptional circumstances: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510. The care of young children is not normally an exceptional circumstance: R v White [1999] NSWCCA 60 at [18], and see generally R v Day (1998) 100 A Crim R 275 and R v Byrne (1998) 104 A Crim R at 456.21 Hardship to the offender’s children was taken into account in R v Tiki (unreported - CCA - 24 August 1994) and in R v Niga (unreported - CCA - April 1994), but in those cases the children were much younger than the Applicant’s two sons who are being cared for generally by their grandmother in the present case, and I would not regard their situation as exceptional, or as being relevant to the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the Applicant.22 That leaves the baby recently born to the Applicant in custody. She is presently being cared for by the Applicant and facilities are available within the Corrective Services Department for this to be done. There is no evidence that she will be disadvantaged to an exceptional degree by remaining with her mother, or that she cannot remain with her mother. Likewise, I would not regard the position of the new baby as exceptional. 23 Next it was submitted that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to properly assess the culpability of the Applicant. In this regard reference was made to the fact that the Applicant did not anticipate driving at the time of drinking and there was a significant degree of what counsel described as ‘coercion’ by Mr Howard involved in the Applicant’s decision to drive, particularly in view of the fact that she had had previous experience of him being violent; and it was submitted that the Applicant had not abandoned responsibility for her actions. In my view there is no substance in this submission. Her Honour expressly referred to the fact that the Applicant had not intended to drive home, and that it was at the urging of Mr Howard that she did so. And she also made specific reference to the fact that she had previously experienced violence from him. But that does not, in my opinion, mean that the Applicant did not abandon responsibility for her actions. 24 Her Honour had regard in particular to the various criteria set out in R v Jurisic (1998) 101 A Crim R 259; 45 NSWLR 209, and I am satisfied, as was the sentencing judge, that these factors showed a particularly gross abandonment of responsibility. Not only were three people killed, but another two passengers were at risk, apart from other road users who may have been in the vicinity. The Applicant drove at an excessive speed, was grossly intoxicated and affected by cannabis at the time, she had driven a lengthy distance and there was some evidence of erratic driving. Moreover, she had never held a full driver’s licence, and did not even hold a learner’s permit at the time. Notwithstanding this, the Applicant had prior convictions for negligent driving and exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 kilometres per hour.25 In addition to all that, after she commenced driving, the passenger Peta Heffernan was skylarking around, not sitting on the seat but kneeling on it, facing into the back, and a person or persons in the backseat were interfering with the Applicant by prodding her with the radio aerial, and someone was pulling her hair. Ms Heffernan was apparently not wearing a seatbelt, a practice which she commonly adopted, and which was known to the Applicant, and at least one of the persons in the backseat must also have not been wearing a seatbelt as there were insufficient seatbelts for them all.26 In these circumstances, not only was it an abandonment of responsibility to commence driving, but it was a gross abandonment of responsibility to continue driving the vehicle in those circumstances. If the other persons were not prepared to cease their activities, it was incumbent on the Applicant to pull over to the side of the road and stop. And I say that, notwithstanding the fact that quite obviously she should never have been driving in the first place.27 It was also submitted that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the level of ‘self punishment’ in the Applicant’s case, and we were referred to R v Dhanhoa [2000] NSWCCA 257, but that was a very different case to the present, as there the Applicant had left his employment because he found he was not coping as a result of the psychological impact of the accident and he had suffered a post-traumatic stress disorder with ongoing depression affecting his social relationships and physical health. These were matters which were supported by psychiatric and psychological evidence, and what the Court held was that the sentencing judge was not in error in taking into account the psychiatric evidence in regard to deciding on the minimum term. This case is very different, in that whilst there was ample evidence before her Honour that this Applicant was genuinely sorry and remorseful for the deaths of these people for which she accepted responsibility, which was all very proper, and whilst she had been considerably distressed by it and had needed and undertaken counselling in respect of it, there was nothing like the psychiatric disorder diagnosed in the case of Mr Dhanhoa. Moreover, the regret, remorse, contrition and acceptance of responsibility on the part of the Applicant were all taken into account by her Honour.28 The final ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. This was, in my view, a particularly bad case, and having regard to the principles enunciated in Jurisic called for a significant sentence, I can detect no identifiable error in her Honour’s reasoning. As Hunt J said in R v Musumeci (unreported - CCA - 30 October 1997), cited with approval in R v Jurisic at 45 NSWLR 228: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, and the taking of a human life by driving a motor vehicle dangerously is to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness. 
          
          
         2. The real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life. … 
          
          
         4. The courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases."" 
         
        
       
     29 For these reasons I would grant leave to make application for leave to appeal out of time. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentence.  
      
       
     30 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     31 DUNFORD J: The order will be as I have indicated.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for an extension of time and leave to appeal against the sentence of imprisonment for a term of 3½ years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months imposed by his Honour Judge JX Gibson QC in the District Court at Bathurst, following the applicant’s plea of guilty to a charge of ongoing supply of heroin for reward contrary to s 25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years.  
      
       
     2 The facts may be summarised as follows. On Monday 19 June 2000 the applicant sold 0.07 grams of heroin for $50 to an undercover police officer. On Tuesday 20 June he sold 0.06 grams of heroin for $50 to the same undercover police officer. On Wednesday 21 June the applicant identified an undercover police officer using an assumed name to a third party and the third party then sold heroin to that undercover police officer. On 22 June 2000 the applicant sold 0.16 grams of heroin for $100 to two undercover police officers, and on Wednesday 5 July 2000 he supplied 0.07 grams of heroin to a third party, who then supplied that same heroin to an undercover police officer. This last transaction between the applicant and the third party occurred in the presence of the undercover police officer and was recorded by way of listening device pursuant to a valid warrant. The applicant received $50 for this transaction from the undercover police officer.  
      
       
     3 On Tuesday 11 July the applicant attended the Bathurst police station to report on bail in respect of another matter. He was arrested, cautioned and searched, and police located approximately $870 on his person, which was seized. He refused, as was his right, to participate in an electronically recorded interview and was charged.  
      
       
     4 The applicant was born on 24 August 1967 and accordingly was aged 34 years at the time of sentencing. He was in a relationship with a young lady and they had a 3-year-old child. He had a difficult and disruptive childhood resulting in a lack of discipline and was sent to the Raby Juvenile Detention Centre at the age of 13 for being uncontrollable. On his release he was rejected by his mother and commenced living on the streets. His schooling was disrupted but he has completed the School Certificate whilst in custody. He has had some casual employment at times, but when not in prison has spent most of his adult life on Social Security. He has used heroin, amphetamines and cannabis since the age of 15 and became addicted to heroin at the age of 16, having intermittent dependent drug use since then.  
      
       
     5 His Honour accepted that he has been an addict for a number of years and was selling the heroin to help feed his habit which, as his Honour noted, is not an excuse, although it may be an explanation for his actions. He has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1980, including convictions for stealing, goods in custody, break enter and steal, possession of firearm, arson, possess prohibited drug, receiving, assault, make and use false instrument, obtain benefit by deception, assault resist and hinder police, high range proscribed content of alcohol, and introducing a prohibited drug into a periodic detention centre.  
      
       
     6 He has served a number of custodial sentences including a minimum term of 18 months in 1990, and fixed terms of 6 months in 1995, 6 months in 1995 and 4 months in 1996. It may be significant that except for the 1990 convictions all his prison sentences appear at a glance to be of fixed terms with no possibility of release under supervision on parole. 
      
       
     7 In September 1998 he was placed on a 2 year recognisance to be of good behaviour, which he failed to keep and to which he was still subject at the time of this offence. On 4 May 2000 he was given 4 months periodic detention for drive whilst disqualified and a 2 year bond for high range proscribed content of alcohol. He was still subject to this bond at the time of this offence. He was also on bail for some other offences including two counts of goods in custody and taking a prohibited drug into a periodic detention centre. 
      
       
     8 His Honour found that he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity, albeit a strong Crown case, and reduced the sentence by 25 per cent on account of such plea. His Honour took all the subjective matters into account and determined on a sentence of 3 years and 9 months, but allowed for 3 months pre-sentence custody referable to this offence, thus reducing the sentence to 3 years and 6 months, and backdated it to commence on 27 April 2001 at the expiration of another sentence then being served. He fixed the non-parole period at 32 months, or 2 years and 8 months, to expire on 16 December 2003.  
      
       
     9 On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the sentence was excessive both as regards the head sentence and the non-parole period. Firstly, it was submitted that as this sentence was cumulative on a 6 month sentence that the applicant was serving at the time, his Honour failed to have regard to the principal of totality. However, this offence was in no way related to the matter the subject of the other sentence which the applicant was already serving. It was, in my view, appropriate to make it wholly cumulative, and the other matter being a comparatively small sentence the principles of totality did not require any reduction in the sentence for this matter.  
      
       
     10 Secondly, it was submitted that the sentence was excessive having regard to the fact that the applicant was an addict and was selling to feed his habit and the quantities involved were comparatively small. As has been made clear in a number of decisions of this Court, the gravamen of the offence under s 25A is the repetition, system and organisation of regular supply and the quantity involved, although relevant, is by no means the only material consideration: R v Smiroldon [2000] NSWCCA 120 at [15]-[16], R v Hofer [2001] NSWCCA 544 at [19]-[20], R v Hoon and Pouoa [2000] NSWCCA 137. As Wood CJ at CL said in R v Kaled [2001] NSWCCA 169 at [18], the section is directed at those who keep the pernicious trade in heroin rolling. This includes the street dealers such as the applicant. 
      
       
     11 For these reasons I am not satisfied that the head sentence was outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion. 
      
       
     12 The other matter which has been the subject of submissions is the non-parole period fixed by his Honour which, it was said, is almost 78 percent of the total sentence, or, on my calculations, about 2 weeks more than 75 percent of the head sentence. There is no magic in the 75% percent. Section 44(2) requires that the non-parole period must not be less than ¾ of the term of the sentence unless there are special circumstances. It does not provide that in the absence of special circumstances it must not be any more than ¾ of the term of the sentence.  
      
       
     13 However, if regard is had to the 6 month sentence on which the present sentence was made cumulative, it represents approximately 80 percent of the total sentences to be served. Adding together his pre-sentence custody in respect of this matter of 3 months, the 6 month sentence for the other matter and the 3 years and 6 months sentence on this matter, the applicant has received total sentences of 4 years and 3 months or 51 months, and in respect of that a non-parole period which would have the effect of him being eligible for parole for a period of 10 months, after serving a minimum of 3 years and 5 months in continuous custody. It was submitted that such a short non-parole period after such a lengthy sentence would not facilitate the applicant’s re-integration into the civilian community as a law abiding citizen.  
      
       
     14 Although the sentencing judge is an experienced judge and I am not prepared to accept that everything not referred to in the Remarks on Sentence was necessarily overlooked, it does appear that in the present case this factor was overlooked. It is therefore necessary to re-sentence the applicant. In doing so I would take into account the matters referred to in the affidavits of the applicant himself, sworn 21 March, and that of Catherine Alice Ridge, his solicitor, sworn the same day. Those affidavits show that he is apparently spending his time in gaol usefully, although I must record my concern that he is being apparently encouraged to do a course in fire-fighting when he already has convictions for arson and threat of damage by fire.  
      
       
     15 I have already made the observation that apart from one occasion he does not appear to have had sentences structured to allow for a significant period of release on parole and that may be something which would benefit him considerably. A period of 10 months would, in my opinion, be a very short period. But in fixing the non-parole period the Court must have regard to the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence: s 44(1)(b); and this involves a consideration not only of the subjective features of the applicant, which in this case include the fact that this offence was committed whilst on bail and whilst subject to two recognisances and to a sentence of periodic detention, but also to the objective seriousness of the offence: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 cited in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [65].  
      
       
     16 The offence requires a substantial non-parole period but I regard 1 year as a period during which it would be appropriate for the applicant to be eligible for release on parole. That would represent about 71 percent of the sentence for the current matter, and I regard the accumulation of sentences as special circumstances. 
      
       
     17 I would therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted, and that the appeal be allowed. I would confirm the head sentence but I would quash the non-parole period and in lieu thereof I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 17 April 2001 and expiring on 16 October 2003.

      10279/02 - NEW SOUTH WALES ROADS & TRAFFIC AUTHORITY v CRAIG HILLYARD and MAGISTRATE OF THE NORTH SYDNEY LOCAL COURT(PETER NORTON, LCM) 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, New South Wales Roads & Traffic Authority (RTA) seeks an order in the nature of certiorari pursuant to s69 of the Supreme Court Act bringing up the proceedings and quashing an order made by the second defendant, the presiding magistrate at the North Sydney Local Court on 5 December 2001.  
     
      
    2 The first defendant was an appellant seeking relief in relation to the suspension of his driving licence by invoking jurisdiction vested and specified in clause 6(1)(c) of the Road Transport (General) Regulation 1999 namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Appeals to Local Court 
        
       
       
        
        6 (1) An affected person may appeal to a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone against any of the following decisions of the Authority: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) ……………. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) ……………. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) a decision to vary, suspend or cancel the person’s driver licence under the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 or the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Regulation 1999.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 The clause also contains provision: 
     
      
       
        
        “(7) A Local Court must hear and determine an appeal made to it under this clause and may confirm (with or without variation) or disallow the decision appealed against, or make such other order in the circumstances as to the Court seems just. “ 
        
       
      
    4 I should set out some background. On 4 October 2001 the RTA (by one of its officers) notified the first defendant that his licence would be suspended for three months on and from 8 November 2001 by reason of his having incurred demerit points under the scheme established under the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998. Some structure was provided by s16 of that Act which specified that the incurring of twelve to fifteen demerit points in a three year period from the day upon which the last of a demerits points earning offence was committed, would result in suspension for three months. Longer periods of suspension were provided for greater point accumulation. 
     
      
    5 The relevant offences of the first defendant were tabulated in the notice which he received and they totalled thirteen points which were incurred for offences between 6 April 1999 and 19 February 2001. The last offence was described as “disobey traffic lights - camera detected” and it added three points. Had these demerit points not been incurred the first defendant’s total would have remained below the suspension threshold of twelve points. 
     
      
    6 After hearing in North Sydney Local Court the second defendant allowed the appeal and quashed the order for suspension. That suspension was described as mandatory in a written submission and advanced by the RTA by reference to s16(2) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 but it was not suggested that the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to allow the appeal and quash the order made by the RTA. 
     
      
    7 A transcript of the hearing below was admitted by consent of the first defendant who has appeared in person both at the hearings in the Local Court and before this Court. The second defendant filed a submitting appearance in the usual form. 
     
      
    8 The transcript reveals, apparently by coincidence, that the same magistrate had dealt with the final offence (of 19 February 2001) which “triggered” the suspension. When that offence was before the Court it was found proved but dismissed pursuant to s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was not disputed that dismissal under that provision did not avoid the accrual of demerit points in respect of the offence which had been found proved. 
     
      
    9 After some discussion the first defendant was sworn to give evidence and the magistrate asked him to refresh his memory about why the dismissal under s10 had been ordered. He said that he had been in Cairns at the time of the offence and was unable to identify the driver as he had “four different people driving” at the time. The first defendant conducted a courier business. The transcript recorded not only evidence but exchanges between the Bench, the first defendant and the representative of the RTA. There was mention of the accrual of points (for the offence then before the Court) and his Worship said “I appreciate he didn’t nominate the driver”. 
     
      
    10 I gather this was a reference to s43(4) of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4)  
        Duty to inform if person not driver of vehicle committing camera-detected traffic light offence or camera-recorded speeding offence. 
        
       
       
        
        A person who: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) is served with a penalty notice or a summons in respect of a camera-detected traffic light offence or camera-recorded speeding offence; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) was not the driver of the vehicle to which the offence relates at the time the offence occurred, 
        
       
       
        
        must, within 21 days after service of the notice or summons, supply by statutory declaration to the authorised officer under section 15 (in the case of a notice) or the informant (in the case of a summons) the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred. “ 
        
       
      
    11 An exception is given possible account by s43(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “43. (1)  
        Responsible person for vehicle taken to have committed designated offences. 
        
       
       
        
        If a designated offence occurs in relation to any registrable vehicle, the person who at the time of the occurrence of the offence is the responsible person for the vehicle is taken to be guilty of an offence under the provision concerned in all respects as if the responsible person were the actual offender guilty of the designated offence unless: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) in any case where such an offence is dealt with under Division 1 – the person satisfies the authorised officer under section 15 that the vehicle was at the relevant time a stolen vehicle or a vehicle illegally taken or used; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in any other case – the court hearing the proceedings for the offence is satisfied that the vehicle was at the relevant time a stolen vehicle or a vehicle illegally taken or used. ” 
        
       
      
    12 In a written submission on behalf of RTA it was contended that the first defendant could have avoided the consequence (of the offence being proved) by demonstrating “reasonable diligence”. Counsel at the hearing (who did not prepare the written submission) drew attention to the appearance of that phrase in s43(3) but it was acknowledged, as must necessarily be the case, that that sub-provision is limited to parking offences.  
     
      
    13 To the extent that counsel drew attention to various provisions in the maze of legislation and regulation, it appears that, other than in respect of a parking offence, the “responsible person in relation to any registrable vehicle” is taken to have committed a designated offence (of which it was assumed that disobeying traffic lights was one) unless the vehicle is shown to have been stolen or unlawfully used. See s43(1). I have presumed that my attention has been drawn to any provision relevant to the determination of the appeal.  
     
      
    14 It is reasonable to infer that if a person was in a position to fulfil the duty specified in s43(4) by supplying the name and address of the person in charge of the vehicle, proceedings might be brought against that nominated person and, presumably as a matter of prosecutorial discretion no proceedings brought against the “responsible person”. Nevertheless, such a prosecutorial election would not seem to affect the limiting expression in s43(1).  
     
      
    15 As I have said, I have been sketching some background. The legal error sought to be attributed to the magistrate is his supposed acting in contravention of clause 6(3) of Schedule 2 of the Road Transport (General) Regulation 1999: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Appeals to Local Court 
        
       
       
        
        6. (1) …………………. 
        
       
       
        
         (2) …………………. 
        
       
       
        
         
         (3) Despite any other provision of this clause, an appeal under this clause does not permit review of: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the guilt or innocence of the person concerned; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the imposition of a penalty or the level of a penalty imposed on the person concerned. ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 It was submitted that the enquiry by the magistrate of the reason for the dismissal pursuant to s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the observation that the first defendant had apparently not demonstrated “reasonable diligence” showed that the provision had not been observed.  
     
      
    17 I do not consider that such is demonstrated. The magistrate at no time challenged the validity of the finding of guilt or the penalty imposed in respect of the offence of 19 February 2001. He simply sought information as to the circumstances which had led to the orders and that is obviously quite a different matter. The prohibition is against review of guilt or penalty but there is no prohibition against the acquisition of appropriate information about the circumstances of the offence and that imposition of penalty. 
     
      
    18 I am conscious that the transcript shows that the learned magistrate expressed criticism about the fairness of attaching demerit points when an offence has been dismissed pursuant to s10 but there is no basis for concluding that he defied the statute, on the contrary, he recognized its authority expressly when he said “I should have the power not to award points but that has been taken from me.”  
     
      
    19 As the matter attracted some attention I should mention that a submission by the RTA that “the only possible drivers were Mr Hillyard’s employees” does not accord with the evidence, which was no more than earlier set out and left open the status of the four drivers who may have been employees and equally may have been contractors, subcontractors or even perhaps friends volunteering their services whilst the first defendant was in North Queensland. No doubt he should be taken to be capable of identifying the four, but he had no power necessarily to compel a confession from anyone that he or she was the offending driver. 
     
      
    20 The face of the record manifests no legal error by the magistrate and he was expressly empowered to make such order as in the circumstances he thought to be just: see clause 6(7) supra.  
     
      
    21 The summons is dismissed with costs.

      Judgment 
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed on the applicant Deborah Anne Renton who pleaded guilty to seven counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon at the Central Local Court on 26 October 2000. She adhered to those pleas of guilty before his Honour Judge Luland QC in the District Court at Sydney on 12 January 2001. The matter was adjourned and the sentences were ultimately imposed on 6 April 2001. 
      
       
     2 Each offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. In respect of four counts, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years to date from 31 August 2000, the date on which she had been arrested and from which she had been in custody with a non-parole period of 2 years, these sentences being concurrent with each other. In respect of the remaining three counts, she was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years to date from 31 August 2002 with a non-parole period of 1 year. These sentences were also concurrent with each other. 
      
       
     3 The overall effect of the sentences was that the applicant was sentenced to an effective sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years, both dating from the date of her arrest, 31 August 2000. His Honour noted that he had reduced the head sentence from 8 years to 6 years on account of her early pleas of guilty. This represented a reduction of 25 percent and is within the guideline judgment of R v Henry & Ors [1999] 46 NSWLR 346. 
      
       
     4 As his Honour noted, the offences were all committed between 4 August 2000 and 19 August 2000. Each was committed in almost identical circumstances. The victims were persons in charge of small businesses, and when alone, the prisoner threatened them with a blood-filled syringe and demanded their money. All the victims were female; the youngest was aged 17 and the eldest 56. In each case, the applicant obtained relatively small amounts of cash, the greatest being $800. When threatening the victims, she usually told them she did not want to hurt them. None were physically injured, but all no doubt have suffered psychological trauma, particularly as she told some or all of them that the blood in the syringe was AIDS-infected, and persons naturally have a great fear of the AIDS virus.  
      
       
     5 The applicant herself was addicted to heroin at this time and was in an abusive relationship with a man who was also drug-addicted and the offences were committed at his urging to satisfy the need for drugs of both of them. 
      
       
     6 The applicant has a criminal record dating back to 1998, including a number of convictions for steal, false pretences, obtain benefit by deception, passing valueless cheques, receiving forged prescriptions and self-administer prohibited drugs. More recent convictions were in 1999 and 2000 when on each occasion she was fined for larceny. In 1990 she served a prison sentence of 4 months. 
      
       
     7 A Pre-Sentence Report, a psychologist's report and some other reports were all before the learned sentencing Judge and were taken into account by his Honour. I have also read and considered them. 
      
       
     8 On behalf of the applicant, considerable reliance is placed on her background leading up to the commission of the offences. She was born on 28 December 1960, being 29 years at the time of the commission of the offences. It appears that she has never been married although she has two children, a daughter now aged about 19 and a son now aged about 15 from different relationships. There have been a number of court proceedings between her and the grandparents of the daughter concerning custody of both of them, and part of the reason for this has been the applicant's criminal history and particularly the fact that she has been in prison; and it appears that she lost custody in 1990 when she was imprisoned for 4 months. Since her release she has had a number of brief relationships, none of which have been successful. 
      
       
     9 She was sentenced to imprisonment at Kogarah and Sutherland Local Courts for stealing and other offences of dishonesty for 6 months in November 1993 but appeals from these sentences were upheld by the District Court on 8 March 1994 when she was released on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 3 years and to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and to undertake the methadone programme and psychiatric counselling. It appears that shortly after this she became involved with a man, James Koning, and maintained a relationship with him until shortly before her arrest in respect of these matters.  
      
       
     10 He was apparently a chronic alcoholic and a manic-depressive. He was given to extreme mood swings and unpredictable behaviour and their 6-year relationship was violent from the start. This relationship is described in some detail in the report of Miss Devine. He persuaded her to discontinue the methadone programme she was on, with the result that she returned to the use of heroin. He then forced her by means of physical violence to work as a prostitute to obtain money to support the heroin habit that they both had until her health deteriorated. When this happened, according to the applicant, she was forced, again with physical violence, to commit the offences of armed robbery in order to obtain money to support their joint drug habit. 
      
       
     11 Shortly after the commission of the last offence which was on 19 August 2000, she at last left Mr Koning, terminating the relationship, and went to live with her mother at Hurstville. On 21 August she attended the Bayside Clinic at Kogarah and recommenced a methadone programme which was continuing at the time of her arrest on 31 August. When arrested she told the police that she was intending to give herself up, and this was confirmed by her mother. Following her arrest she made full admissions, including disclosing two offences which the police were not then aware of, and then pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. She has been in custody since 31 August 2000. 
      
       
     12 In sentencing the appellant his Honour noted and had regard to all of the matters to which I have referred. He specifically found that the offences were committed at her de facto's urging, she was remorseful, she had genuine concerns for her victims, and she had had a very difficult life. His Honour acknowledged her drug problems and her attempt to overcome them whilst in prison by continuing counselling and the Pre-Sentence Report indicated that she had sought assistance from the Salvation Army in relation to her drug problem and sought rehabilitation from the REACH Programme. 
      
       
     13 I am satisfied from reading his Honour's reasons that his Honour did take all these matters into account and in particular, that the sentence was significantly reduced because of the pressure she was under from her de facto to commit these offences, her pleas of guilty, her subsequent co-operation with the police, that she had terminated the relationship and had started to get assistance with her drug problem. However, it was submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to a number of matters which are set out in the Written Submissions. I am satisfied that his Honour did take most of these matters into account.  
      
       
     14 The fact that the syringe was not filled with AIDS-infected blood is of only limited significance because it is somewhat akin to the unloaded shotgun, the person threatened with it is not aware that the blood in the syringe is not AIDS-infected, especially when told that it is. This Court has said on a number of occasions that the use of a syringe apparently filled with blood is a particularly serious factor because of the terror and revulsion it causes to the victims: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [17] and cases there cited.  
      
       
     15 It was also submitted that his Honour failed to pay sufficient regard to the fact that this applicant was said to be ""at the crossroads"". This normally suggests that by extending leniency at this stage, the rehabilitation of the offender will be promoted. In the present case it appears that this applicant was probably treated as being “at the crossroads” in March 1994 when appeals to the District Court were allowed following two sets of convictions for which imprisonment had been imposed and she was released with a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 3 years, a recognizance which she did not keep; as is apparent not only from her return to drug use, but the fact that she had further convictions for stealing in March of 1995.  
      
       
     16 His Honour took into account the termination of her relationship with her former de facto, her pre-arrest re-engagement with the methadone programme and her continued progress in this regard whilst in custody and her prospects for rehabilitation upon release. In my opinion, no further leniency was called for. 
      
       
     17 Accordingly I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentences. 
      
       
     18 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
      
       
     19 DUNFORD J: The order will be as I have indicated.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: After a trial lasting four days before Job ADCJ and a jury, the appellant was convicted on the first three counts of the indictment against him. The appellant was represented by counsel, though not the counsel who appeared on this appeal.  
      
       
     2 The first count was: 
      
       
        
         
         “[The appellant on] 20 December 1998 … did assault [the complainant] and … he … did, at the time of such assault, commit an act of indecency upon the said [complainant] she then being a child under the age of 10 years namely of the age of 6 years.” 
         
        
        
       The second count was: 
        
        
         
         “[The appellant on] 20 December 1998 … did assault [the complainant] and … he … did, at the time of such assault, commit an act of indecency upon the said [complainant] she then being a child under the age of 10 years namely of the age of 6 years.” 
         
        
        
       These counts alleged contraventions of s 61M(1) of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900.  
        
       
     3 The third count was: 
      
       
        
         
         “[The appellant on] 20 December 1998 … did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] a child then under the age of 10 years namely of the age of six years.” 
         
        
        
       This alleged a contravention of s 66A of the  
       Crimes Act 
       . 
        
       
     4 The appellant was sentenced to six years imprisonment on the third count, which, allowing for time served, was a sentence of five years ten months and fourteen days dating from 22 February 2001. A non-parole period of three years and four months was fixed. On the other two charges the trial judge imposed a fixed term of two years and six months dating from 22 February 2001 to be served concurrently with the sentence on the third count.  
      
       
     5 The appellant appeals against the convictions, and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
      
       
        
       The factual background 
        
       
     6 The factual background as narrated by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence was as follows. In considering it, it is to be remembered that the appellant denies that he was the criminal.  
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant was born on 15 January 1992 and was six years and 10 months old at the time of the offences committed by the prisoner. She and her mother and the complainant’s two brothers lived next door to the prisoner and his wife. The prisoner kept birds and the complainant was a frequent visitor to the prisoner’s home and the complainant liked to help look after the birds. The prisoner had promised the complainant a baby budgie for her 7th birthday.  
         
        
        
         
         On the day of the offence the complainant and her family had just returned from holidays. She went into the prisoner’s premises. The prisoner’s wife had left to go to work. During the morning whilst in the spare bedroom the complainant was assisting the prisoner vacuum a … bed cover. At one stage the complainant was on the cover and the prisoner placed the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner onto her legs and ran it up her legs. He pulled the leg of the complainant’s panties aside and placed the nozzle of the cleaner onto her genitals [count 1]. 
         
        
        
         
         The sequence of the next two events is not clear. The prisoner did take hold of the complainant’s wrist and made her rub his penis up and down for a couple of seconds [count 2]. The prisoner lowered the shorts he was wearing and the complainant noticed that he was not wearing underwear. The prisoner put his legs on either side of the complainant and placed his penis into her genitalia. The complainant’s evidence was that ‘it went in a little bit’ [count 3]. 
         
        
        
         
         After these events the prisoner and the complainant cleaned some of the bird cages. The prisoner supplied the complainant with some lunch which she took home with her. In the afternoon she went back to the prisoner’s home and was speaking to the prisoner and his wife. That evening the complainant told her mother of some of the things that the prisoner had done to her. The mother saw that the complainant’s genitalia was red and appeared to have some abrasions. 
         
        
        
         
         The next day the complainant was examined by a doctor and the doctor found that there were red marks on the top of the child’s legs and other areas, that there was reddening of the labia minora and labia majora and the labia majora was too tender for the proper examination to be carried out. The complainant complained both to her mother and to the doctor of pain when urinating. The injuries fortunately were not serious, for a week later when the complainant was again examined it was found that all of the injuries had cleared up and it was noted that the hymen was intact. 
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner was interviewed by the police and denied that he had ever interfered with the complainant in any way. He went to great lengths to tell the police that the complainant was a nuisance and often coming to his home and getting in his way in his efforts to do his duties. However he did tell the police that he did not wear underwear. The prisoner did not give evidence at his trial.” 
         
        
        
       The Crown case 
        
       
     7 The appellant’s written submissions summarised the Crown case, and put submissions about alleged weaknesses in it, in the following way.  
      
       
        
         
         “The Complainant gave evidence that she used to visit the Appellant’s house and that sometimes the Appellant was there with his wife … and that sometimes he was there by himself (19/02: T5). She said that she went over to the Appellant’s house on the morning of 20 December 1998 which was the day after she had returned from holidays The Appellant was there by himself, his wife having gone to work. She said that she helped the Appellant clean some bird cages (he kept caged birds in his garage and in his backyard). She said that she then helped the Appellant with some housework (T7). They went to the spare bedroom and the Appellant was using a vacuum cleaner to ‘get the wool off the lammy’, that is vacuuming the wool underlay on the bed. She said that whilst she was on the floor the Appellant started rubbing the nozzle of the vacuum cleaner over her legs getting closer to her vagina. He then rubbed the vacuum cleaner on her vagina: ‘he started rubbing it, like putting it on my fanny’ (T8: Count 1). At the time she was wearing a dress and underpants. The Appellant allegedly pulled her underpants to one side when he put the vacuum cleaner on her vagina. The Complainant said that the Appellant then placed his penis into her vagina and that it went in ‘a little bit’ (Count 3, or in the alternative Count 4). He had his pants down and he wasn’t wearing any underpants. It was the first time that she saw his penis (T11-12). She then said that he took her wrist and made her ‘rub his penis up and down’ (T12: Count 2). At some point of time she saw ‘yellow pussy stuff’ come out of his penis (T12). 
         
        
        
         
         The Complainant gave evidence that after the incident she went out the back with the Appellant and helped him with the cages. The Appellant made her some pasta for lunch, which she took home to eat. She said that before she left the Appellant told her ‘don’t tell anyone because we will get in trouble’ (T16). After lunch she returned to the Appellant’s house. Later she went back home. Before going to bed she went to the toilet. She said that she told her mother that the Appellant ‘went up and down my leg with the vacuum thing’ and that ‘he put his doodle in my fanny’ (T15). 
         
        
        
         
         In cross-examination the Complainant agreed that in her statement to police she said that the vacuum cleaner incident occurred when she was lying on the bed (20/2: T10). When reminded of her statement she said that she thought she was on the bed when the Appellant touched her with the vacuum cleaner (and not on the floor as she had said in her evidence in chief). She also said that after he pulled her underpants to one side she held them in that position (not having said that in chief). She said that the vacuum cleaner was small (T14). She was ‘pretty sure’ that she told her mother that night that the Appellant put his ‘doodle’ in her ‘fanny’ (T21). At T22, the Complainant said that she was sure the vacuum cleaner incident came first but she wasn’t sure whether the rubbing of the penis or the penis in the vagina came next (T22). The Complainant agreed that in her police statement she said that there were two occasions when the Appellant did something with the vacuum cleaner. She agreed that her earlier evidence was that there was just one occasion. She said that ‘he must have done it two times but I just probably forgot’ (T23). 
         
        
        
         
         [The] Complainant’s mother gave evidence that her daughter told her in the evening that she had a secret and that she said ‘when I was at [the appellant’s] today he made me rub his penis’ (or perhaps she used the word doodle) and that at some point he ‘rubbed his doodle against my fanny’ and ‘put it in her hole’ (T9). She said that the complainant said that it hurt and that she noticed the genital area was red and grazed as well (T7). She said that she put the underpants and dress that the Complainant was wearing into a bag which was later handed over to [a medical practitioner]. In cross-examination she agreed that she had said nothing in either of her two statements about her daughter telling her on the night of the incidents that the Appellant had put his penis in her vagina (T14). She then gave evidence that to the best of her recollection her daughter did not say anything on the night of the incident about the Appellant putting his penis in her vagina or fanny (T15). 
         
        
        
         
         [The medical practitioner] gave evidence that she examined the Complainant on 21 December 1998 who complained of soreness in the genital area. The Complainant said that the Appellant had hurt her ‘rude part’ with a vacuum cleaner (20/2: T5). The Complainant initially told [the medical practitioner] that the Appellant didn’t do anything else and that nothing else happened. After further questioning, the Complainant said that his ‘rude part went in there’, pointing at her vaginal area (T6). She said that nothing came out of his penis (contrary to her evidence at the trial). Upon examination [the medical practitioner] saw redness of the labia minora. The hymen was intact and ‘normal’. There were a few scattered red non-tender spots up to half a centimetre in diameter on the mons pubis. The marks ‘could have been caused by the use of a suction device’ or some other cause (T7). As mentioned above [the medical practitioner] was handed underpants, a dress and a nightie, items which were later forwarded to the Government Analyst for examination (Suzanne Briese).  
         
        
        
         
         In cross-examination [the medical practitioner] said that lack of sperm in a semen could be due to the donor having had a vasectomy ([the complainant’s mother’s friend] gave evidence that he had had a vasectomy (T33)). Other reasons included the donor being sterile or drug use by the donor. Although questions asked in re-examination regarding the effect of steroids on the presence or otherwise of sperm were rejected, it is submitted that the effect was very prejudicial in the context of the trial. The jury having heard the question were left with the impression that [the medical practitioner] was then not allowed to give her answer, arguably prejudicing the Defendant more than if the answer had been given. 
         
        
        
         
         Suzanne Briese, forensic biologist, gave evidence that she was given a sexual assault investigation kit to examine (20/2: T23). The kit included the underpants worn by the Complainant, her dress, her nightie and vulval and oral swabs. Ms Briese detected a semen stain (10cmx5cm) in the crutch area of underpants. She gave evidence that the semen stain ‘most likely’ originated from the inside of the underpants. A smaller stain (about the size of a 5 cent coin) was also located on the outside front of the underpants. Semen was not detected on the oral or vulval swabs. There was no evidence that Ms Briese examined the dress. It is submitted that her failure to examine the dress is of significance having regard to the evidence given by [the complainant’s mother’s friend] (see paragraph 2.11 below).  
         
        
        
         
         Blood samples were taken from the Complainant, the Appellant, [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and the Complainant’s two brothers … . Robert Goetz (Bachelor of Science) gave evidence that he conducted protein typing analysis (PGM system) using the above blood samples and the underpants that had been examined by Suzanne Briese (20/2: T30). Both of the Complainant’s brothers were excluded as being possible donors of the semen found on the underpants. He found that: 
         
        
       
     · the underpants had a PGM type ‘2+1+’. 
      
       
     · the Appellant had a PGM type ‘2+’. 
      
       
     · [the complainant’s mother’s friend] had a PGM type ‘2+1+’. 
      
       
     · the Complainant had a PGM type ‘1+’. 
      
       
        
         
         Mr Goetz concluded that about 25% of the population could have contributed to the semen on the underpants. Either the Appellant or [the complainant’s mother’s friend] could have been the contributor of the semen (T31). In cross-examination Mr Goetz was asked whether there was ‘any way of determining the likelihood of it being one against the other? That is [the complainant’s mother’s friend] versus the Accused …?’ Mr Goetz said that there was not. He agreed that having regard to his scientific knowledge, it was not possible for him to say ‘whether it might have been more likely one or the other ‘ (T33). Mr Goetz also found that the semen stain detected was devoid of sperm cells. As such it was impossible to take the testing any further. DNA testing could not be carried out (T33). The Appellant’s submissions as to the significance of Mr Goetz’s evidence are set out at paragraph 4 below. 
         
        
        
         
         [The complainant’s mother’s friend] gave evidence that the Complainant went next door to the Appellant’s house about mid-morning on 20 December 1998 and helped him with his birds (20/2: T34). She came back home to eat lunch and then he, [the complainant’s mother] and the Complainant went shopping. When they got back the Complainant went next door again. [The complainant’s mother’s friend] and [the complainant’s mother] started to watch a video before [the complainant’s mother] left to go for a walk with a friend. Whilst he was alone in the house [the complainant’s mother’s friend] said that he put on an R-rated movie and masturbated and ejaculated into his hand (T35). At the time he was sitting on a three-seater lounge. He then said that [one of the complainant’s brothers] came home, then the Complainant, and then [the complainant’s mother]. [The complainant’s brother] (who would have been 15 or 16 in December 1998) did not give any evidence in the trial. The effect of [the complainant’s mother’s] evidence was that her son … arrived as she was leaving ‘because he saw me going, he said ‘I got home just after you left’ (20/201: T15). She made no mention of any such conversation with her son in her police statement (T16). It is submitted that on her evidence [the complainant’s mother’s friend] would not have had enough time to do what he said he did. Contrary to her mother’s and [the complainant’s mother’s friend’s] evidence, the Complainant said that when she arrived home from next door [the complainant’s mother’s friend], her two brothers  
         and 
          her mother were present. It is submitted that these contradictions and the Crown’s failure to call [the complainant’s brother] are significant as bearing on the fact of whether [the complainant’s mother’s friend] was alone with the child at any time so as to give him the opportunity for some sexual impropriety. 
         
        
        
         
         [The complainant’s mother’s friend] said that after the Complainant got home she sat on the lounge with him and that she sat in the position he had been in when he was masturbating (T36-7). 
         
        
        
         
         Under cross-examination [the complainant’s mother’s friend] agreed that he said nothing to police in his first statement dated 29 March 1999 about the masturbation and ejaculation (T38). He said he telephoned Det Carroll on 6 September 1999 and asked to make another statement because [the complainant’s mother] had asked him ‘was there any reason why there’d be semen around’ (T38). He said that he told her there would be and that he’d better speak to Jodie Carroll. He agreed that he had a vasectomy on 13 February 1997 (which would account for there being no sperm in the stains on the Complainant’s underpants if the stains emanated from [the complainant’s mother’s friend]. On the other hand, the Appellant’s wife gave evidence that some months after December 1998 she conceived a child with the Appellant (see paragraph 3.2 below) and there was no evidence in the trial that he was sterile for any reason as at December 1998. In cross-examination, [the complainant’s mother’s friend] could give no explanation as to how this semen could have got on the area identified by Ms Briese as containing semen. He denied sexually abusing the Complainant on 20 December 1998 (T39). 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that in the context of [the complainant’s mother’s friend’s] evidence Ms Briese’s failure to examine the Complainant’s dress assumes great significance. If [the complainant’s mother’s friend’s] semen ended up on the Complainant’s underpants one would have expected to find his semen on her dress given that, on his evidence the only way she could have come into contact with his semen was by sitting on the couch (presumably whilst wearing her dress). If the dress had been tested and showed no trace of semen, it is submitted that such evidence would have had the potential to significantly undermine [the complainant’s mother’s friend’s] evidence and raise the real possibility that he was involved in some kind of sexual impropriety with the Complainant (which he denied). This in turn would have undermined the Complainant’s assertion that no such impropriety occurred and her credibility generally.”  
         
        
        
       The defence case 
        
       
     8 The appellant’s written submissions summarise the defence case as follows.  
      
       
        
         
         “The Defendant did not give evidence at the trial, relying on his record of interview with police which attached a document he had prepared at the time that he was served with an Apprehended Violence Order. The Appellant denied all of the allegations, which were put to him in his record of interview He gave a detailed account of the events of 20 December 1998. No evidence was led to explain the context in which the Appellant elected not to give evidence (see paragraph 6 below). 
         
        
        
         
         The Appellant’s wife … gave evidence that she and the Appellant had had a child born on 19 February 2000 and that the child had been conceived in the normal course (21/2: T4). She said that she went to work on 20 December 1998 and that the Complainant came over some time after she got home. She said that the Complainant was ‘fine” and that she asked for an ice-cream and a drink. In cross-examination she agreed that her husband was into bodybuilding but that he wasn’t training at the time because of his bowel problem (T6).” 
         
        
        
       Ground 3  
        
       
     9 It is convenient, in understanding other grounds of appeal, to deal first with Ground 3. Ground 3 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “The verdicts were unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     10 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Appellant contends that a jury acting reasonably and properly ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt so as to warrant appellate intervention

         Morris 
          163 CLR 454. 
         
        
        
         
         In support of this ground the Appellant relies on: 
         
        
       
     · the various submissions set out in paragraph 2 above as to the frailties in the Complainant’s evidence and the various shortcomings in the Crown case. 
      
       
     · concerning the s 66A count, the inconsistency between the Complainant’s evidence that she told her mother on the night that the Appellant had ‘put his doodle in her fanny’ and the mother’s evidence that to the best of her recollection the Complainant hadn’t said anything about that on the night. The Complainant’s initial response to [the medical practitioner] is noted (that other than the vacuum cleaner incident he didn’t do anything else and that nothing else happened). [The medical practitioner’s] evidence that the hymen was intact and ‘normal’ is also noted in relation to the s 66A count. 
      
       
     · the significant problem faced by the Crown (particularly having regard to the report of Dr McDonald) concerning the possibility of some sexual impropriety between [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and the Complainant and the adverse consequences for the Complainant’s credibility given her denials in that regard.” 
      
       
     11 In evaluating these submissions it is necessary initially to keep out of account Dr McDonald’s report, since it was not before the jury. Its relevance is to Grounds 1 and 2. However, at a later stage the significance of Dr McDonald’s report in conjunction with the other Ground 3 arguments will be considered. 
      
       
     12 The Crown’s submissions in answer were: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was open to the jury, upon the whole of the evidence in the trial of the appellant, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the offences for which he was found guilty:  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (1997) 191 CLR 439, 450-1 per Gaudron, McHugh & Gummow JJ; further in answering the question whether it was open to the jury to be so satisfied, ‘the court must not disregard or discount the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations’: see  
         M v The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 487, 493 and  
         Jones v The Queen 
          (supra) 451 per Gaudron, McHugh & Gummow JJ. 
         
        
        
         
         The frailties in the complainant’s evidence and the shortcomings in the Crown case set forth in paragraph 2, and in particular paragraph 2.4, of the appellant’s submissions are not such that it was not open to the jury to be so satisfied, and the jury had the advantage of seeing her give evidence; although the complainant’s mother gave, in cross-examination, evidence of complaint that differed from that of the complainant, it was open to the jury to accept the complainant’s account. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence of [the complainant’s mother’s friend] Transcript, 20 Feb 2001, pages 35-6 and of the complainant’s mother (Transcript, 20 Feb 2001, page 15) (see paragraph 2.11 of the appellant’s submissions) was not such that the jury could have found that there was not available time for [the complainant’s mother’s friend] to have done what he said he had done or that he could not have done so; since [the complainant’s brother] could not have known how long [the complainant’s mother’s friend] was alone his evidence on this point is not shown likely to be relevant; it was well open to the jury to accept [the complainant’s mother’s friend’s] account. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence of [the complainant’s mother’s friend] (Transcript, 20 Feb 2001, page 36) and of the complainant (Transcript, 19 Feb 2001, page 14) was that [the complainant’s brother] was at home with [the complainant’s mother’s friend] when the complainant returned; the evidence of the complainant’s mother referred to in paragraph 2.11 (Transcript 20 Feb 2001, page 15) was also to that effect, that is that [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and the complainant were not alone at the relevant time; it is not shown that the evidence of [the complainant’s brother] could have been relevant. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not shown that the sperm detected on the complainant’s underpants was that of [the complainant’s mother’s friend] or that it was there as a result of any sexual impropriety committed by him against the complainant; both [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and the complainant denied that any such impropriety took place; the evidence goes no further than that of Mr Goetz (Transcript, 20 Feb 2001, page 31) that the sperm could have been that of [the complainant’s mother’s friend] (and also could have been that of the appellant) and the evidence of Dr McDonald can take it no further; there is nothing to suggest that the circumstances were such that absence of sperm on the complainant’s dress would have had any bearing, since the sperm on the complainant’s underpants was not shown to be that of [the complainant’s mother’s friend]; accordingly it is now shown that the failure of Mr Briese to test it for sperm is of any significance.  
         
        
        
         
         The normal appearance of the hymen and the lack of injuries noted by [the medical practitioner] (Transcript, 20 Feb 2001, page 6) (who also noted that the hymen was located relatively deeply) did not show that there had been no sexual penetration of the complainant’s vagina; the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant was wearing no underpants at the time: Transcript, 19 Feb 2001, page 19; this was supported by the answer given by the appellant in answer to Question 227 in the ERISP (Transcript of ERISP, Exhibit K) that he did not wear underwear. This answer strongly supports the complainant’s evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         This Ground of Appeal ought to be rejected.” 
         
        
       
     13 The following issues arise. It is convenient initially to examine them separately to see whether any individual point supports the ground, and at the end consider whether any two or more of them in combination do so. 
      
       
        
       Weaknesses in the complainant’s evidence 
        
       Differences in relation to the evidence of complaint to the police  
        
       
     14 One point taken in the appellant’s submissions is that in chief the complainant said the appellant had touched her with the vacuum cleaner while she was lying on the “lammy”, and it was on the floor; but in cross-examination she admitted that she told the police that she was lying on the “lammy” while it was on the bed; and in cross-examination she also said she thought she was on the bed, and that the “lammy” was moved to the floor only after the vacuum cleaner touched her. She was asked to explain this and said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Is there any reason why you make a mistake about where you were when I asked you those questions earlier? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because then probably after that it was on the floor. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So having looked at those questions and answers you say the lambie was placed on the floor after you had the vacuum cleaner placed on your fanny, is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I think so.” 
         
        
       
     15 The jury was entitled not to treat this divergence as sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the central parts of her testimony. 
      
       
        
       Holding the complainant’s underpants 
       
     16 In cross-examination the complainant said that just before the appellant penetrated her, he moved her underpants to one side, he told her to keep them there, and she did so. She did not give evidence about holding them in that position in chief; indeed she said in chief that her underpants were down. In cross-examination, after the evidence just referred to, she was asked: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you tell us about that yesterday? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I want to put this to you, you haven’t told anyone before today about holding your underpants to the side, do you agree or disagree with that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I think I disagree because I think I’ve told … (not transcribable) … of that before.” 
         
        
       
     17 These assertions were not contradicted. The jury was entitled not to treat this divergence, either, as sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the central parts of the complainant’s testimony. 
      
       
        
       Differences between the complainant’s evidence of complaint to her mother and her mother’s evidence 
        
       
     18 In chief the complainant said she had told her mother that the appellant penetrated her. In cross-examination she said twice that she told her this. The mother said in chief that the complainant had complained of being penetrated. In cross-examination she agreed that in her police statements she had not recorded that aspect of the complaint. The evidence continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. If she told you that, why – is there any reason why it’s not in your statement made ten days after the event? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I was under a fair bit of stress and duress over this and, when I gave my statement ‘cause just, I must have omitted it.” 
         
        
       
     19 In view of the confused state of the mother’s evidence, the jury was entitled to prefer the complainant’s, particularly, as will be seen, a like complaint was made to the medical practitioner the following day.  
      
       
        
       Two vacuum cleaner incidents or one 
        
       
     20 In chief the complainant described what happened with the vacuum cleaner thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Are you able to tell us what happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well he was rubbing it up and down my legs and each time it went up my leg it got closer and closer to my fanny and then he started rubbing it, like putting it on my fanny.” 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now did anything happen to the underpants that you were wearing then when he put the vacuum cleaner on your fanny? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He pulled them to one side. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What happened with the vacuum cleaner? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Then he put it on my fanny. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Which part of the vacuum cleaner did he put on your fanny? 
         
        
        
         
         A. The top. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now was the top of the vacuum cleaner on your clothing or under your clothing, like on your underpants or under your underpants? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Under my underpants. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it on your skin? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     21 In cross-examination she said there was only one incident with a vacuum cleaner. She told the police there had been two. The evidence continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. That seems to be different to what you remember today about there only being one time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well what -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. So he must have done it two times but I just probably forgot. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you’ve made a mistake today have you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
     22 Again the jury were entitled not to treat this as raising a reasonable doubt about the central aspects of the complainant’s evidence.  
      
       
        
       Complaint to medical practitioner 
        
       
     23 When the complainant saw the medical practitioner the next day, she said initially that her genital region had been hurt by the vacuum cleaner. The medical practitioner said “Did he do anything else?”, and the complainant said “No”. After further questions the complainant complained of penetration, but denied that anything had come out of the appellant’s penis. The complainant’s evidence was that it had. 
      
       
     24 The medical practitioner recorded a statement by the complainant that she was worried that the appellant would repeat his conduct. There is every reason to suppose that she was nervous during the consultation with the medical practitioner. The jury were entitled to treat the delayed way in which the complaint of penetration was made to the medical practitioner as not being inconsistent with its occurrence, and they were entitled to accept her evidence that something had come out of the appellant’s penis even though she told the medical practitioner the opposite.  
      
       
        
       The problems in the evidence taken in combination 
        
       
     25 Whether taken separately or together, the divergences in the complainant’s evidence and the contradictions between it and other evidence were not sufficient to make it obligatory for the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt either on the third count or on either of the first two. The complaint to the medical practitioner of penetration was made only moments after the denial that the appellant did anything other than hurt her with the vacuum cleaner. That complaint tends to confirm her evidence in chief. The jury were entitled to reject her mother’s evidence that she did not complain about penetration; or, alternatively, if they accepted it, were entitled to accept the complainant’s evidence that penetration had occurred even though she had not complained about it and wrongly said that she had.  
      
       
        
       The state of the hymen 
        
       
     26 The appellant submitted that the medical practitioner’s evidence was that the hymen was intact and appeared normal. That is to take it out of context. What the medical practitioner recorded was: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was difficult to separate the labia majora as this was painful and it was therefore difficult to visualise the deeper structures clearly. The labia minor, that’s the inner lips were generally reddened. The hymen, which was located relatively deeply and was only visualised briefly, appeared normal, no injuries were noted. That means to the hymen. The urethra and surrounding area were not visualised due to pain. The urethra is the opening that you pass urine through. There was posterior labial fusion. That means that the inner lips were slightly joined together posterially, that’s a finding that you sometimes find in young girls.” 
         
        
       
     27 That account is entirely consistent with the small degree of penetration of which the complainant testified (“a little bit”). The medical practitioner also recorded the complainant’s complaints of genital soreness and pain on urination, including urination just before the interview.  
      
       
        
       Rejected question in re-examination 
        
       
     28 The opening questions in the cross-examination of the medical practitioner were: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Doctor a question of a general nature before I ask you about your examination. Tell me this – if there was a semen sample collected which had no sperm in it there might be a variety of reasons why there would be no sperm, correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. One of those reasons might be if the donor of the semen sample had had a vasectomy? Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Another reason might be if the donor of the semen sample was sterile? That it was incapable of producing spermatozoa? Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you think of any other reason why there might be a sample of semen absent of sperm? 
         
        
        
         
         A. There might be temporary reasons for not having sperm in the semen. Drug-related for example. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what type of drugs might -- 
         
        
        
         
         A. I wouldn’t be in a position to comment – I don’t consider myself to be an expert on what drugs would cause that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So that the three possible explanations that would occur to you would be – drug related; vasectomy or sterility? Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. They would be three, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. And they’re the only three that you can advance at this stage? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’m not, I can’t think of any others just at the moment.” 
         
        
       
     29 The re-examination was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Doctor relative to the initial questions that my learned friend asked you about possible reasons for there being no sperm in semen – you suggested that a third reason could be drug-related. Now when you refer to drug-related are you, what types of drugs are you referring to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I already declined to answer that question. I mean for example people who are on medication for cancer, that would be an example but I don’t consider myself – I’m not a urologist and I’m not an expert on sperm counts. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you speak of drugs is a steroid a drug that you would class as a drug? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And could steroids taken by persons wanting to build up their body – can they be I should say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Can steroids be taken -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And could the intake of or ingestion of steroids be a possible or probable cause of there being no sperm in semen? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION.” 
         
        
       
     30 If the fourth question in re-examination was inadmissible, so were the first three. The basis of inadmissibility would no doubt be lack of expertise. According to the appellant, the asking of that fourth question (not “questions”, as the written submissions say) was “very prejudicial” in its effect. Whether that is so can be gauged from the reaction of those present at the trial. Counsel for the appellant, having successfully objected, went no further. For example, counsel did not apply for a discharge of the jury, or demand a judicial comment at that point, or record an intention to seek a special direction in relation to the matter when the trial judge summed up. The trial judge did not mention the re-examination in summing up, only the cross-examination. If counsel for the appellant had thought that what had happened was prejudicial, a special direction could have been requested just before or during the summing up. None was, either before it began, or when the court adjourned near the end of the summing up on 21 February 2001, or when it concluded on 22 February 2001. Further, it is not correct to say that the jury, having heard the rejected question, “were left with the impression that the [medical practitioner] was … not allowed to give her answer, arguably prejudicing the Defendant more than if the answer had been given”. It is highly probable that the answer would, for the third time, have been that the medical practitioner was insufficiently expert to answer the question. It is also highly probable that the jury would have inferred that that answer would have been given had there been no objection.  
      
       
        
       Impropriety by the complainant’s mother’s friend and the complainant’s dress 
        
       
     31 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
        
       (a) that the failure by Ms Briese to examine the complainant’s dress is of “great significance”; 
        
        
       (b) that if the friend’s semen ended up on the complainant’s underpants one would have expected to find his semen on her dress given that, on his evidence, the only way she could have come in contact with his semen was by sitting on the couch while wearing her dress; 
        
        
       (c) that if the dress had been tested and showed no trace of semen, that would have had the potential to undermine the friend’s evidence and raise the real possibility that he had engaged in sexual impropriety with the complainant; and 
        
        
       (d) that that in turn would have undermined the complainant’s denial of impropriety with him, and hence her credibility generally. 
        
       
     32 As to point (a), whether Ms Briese examined the dress is uncertain. Certainly counsel for the appellant did not ask her if she did. If the failure to examine the dress were in truth of “great significance”, it is surprising that it was not distinctly established. That it was not distinctly established suggests that it was not in truth of any significance at all.  
      
       
     33 As to point (b), the friend said his semen did not get onto the lounge on which the complainant later sat. He also denied doing anything which would have caused his semen to be in the complainant’s underpants. If his semen had been in the complainant’s underpants, it is possible that it could have been on her dress; but the submission does not establish that his semen was on her underpants.  
      
       
     34 As to point (c), absence of semen on the complainant’s dress could not have undermined the friend’s evidence, and hence step (d) does not follow. 
      
       
        
       Mr Goetz’s evidence 
        
       
     35 The appellant’s written submissions assert that the significance of Mr Goetz’s evidence is set out in paragraph 4 of those submissions. The reasoning in paragraph 4 depends on the reception of Dr McDonald’s evidence and thus is to be put on one side for the present. 
      
       
        
       The appellant’s points considered in combination 
        
       
     36 Even if one takes any two or more of the arguments assembled in support of Ground 3 together, the Ground is not made out. That is so partly because of their inherent weakness and partly because of the strength of the Crown case. The medical practitioner was confident that there was redness and soreness in the complainant’s genital region, and the complainant’s mother observed similar phenomena also. The medical practitioner said there were two possible causes: injury and infection. She took a swab; a laboratory analysis found no infection; and this led her to be “reasonably confident” in excluding infection as a possible cause. That left injury. The medical practitioner also saw spots in the genital region which were tender, unlike marks on her chest. The medical practitioner thought that a vacuum cleaner could have caused them. So far as the appellant’s arguments were directed to the suggestion that nothing unlawful had happened to the complainant, they inevitably fail. There was evidence confirming penetration and there was evidence confirming an indecent assault with the vacuum cleaner.  
      
       
     37 On the question of who caused her harm, the evidence of the complainant was confirmed in part by the appellant, who admitted to the police that he habitually did not wear underpants; in part by the immediate complaint made to the mother on 20 December; in part by the complaint made to the medical practitioner the next day; and in part by the complaint made to the police the next day. These items of evidence did not amount to corroboration in the sense of that term as used in the common law rule which preceded the enactment of the Evidence Act, but they did show consistency and they were evidence of the facts asserted. The complainant’s evidence was also confirmed by the fact that the complainant seemed depressed on her return home at lunchtime with the lunch which the appellant had prepared. There is also no question that the appellant had a lengthy opportunity to do what the complainant said he did. 
      
       
     38 The jury were confronted by several disputes on matters of primary fact, largely turning on their assessment of oral evidence. They were assisted by a summing up of which no complaint was made, either at the time or before this court. The trial judge warned them of the need for caution in relying on the evidence of a single witness who was a young child testifying about events over two years earlier. He also dealt with the key issues which the appellant now raises on appeal, particularly concerning divergences in complaint and other difficulties in the complainant’s position.  
      
       
     39 If the complainant’s condition had not been caused by the appellant, then there was only one other possible cause: the friend. The friend denied responsibility. There was substantial evidence that his opportunity to misconduct himself with the complainant was extremely limited, and for practical purposes non-existent. If he and the complainant were accepted on the main parts of their evidence, the Crown case was strong.  
      
       
     40 Indeed, the appellant’s case depends on the propositions that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the complainant is to be disbelieved completely in relation to her evidence against the appellant and in relation to her denial of misconduct by the friend; 
        
        
       (b) the complainant’s mother is to be disbelieved at least as to whether her son told her he arrived home just after she left and as to whether he was in the house when first the complainant and then the mother returned; 
        
        
       (c) the friend is to be disbelieved in saying that the son came home before the complainant and before the mother and in denying this conduct with the complainant.  
        
       
     41 In the written submissions, it is contended there is a contradiction between the evidence of the mother and the friend, on the one hand, and the evidence of the mother and the complainant on the other. The complainant said that when she arrived at her home in the afternoon, the friend, her two brothers and her mother were present. Examination in the course of oral argument revealed that in truth the complainant’s argument related to when she arrived home that evening and, in effect, during twilight. 
      
       
     42 One major difficulty in disbelieving the friend is that it would have been very easy for him to have kept silent about the conduct that took place while he was alone, and very much in his interests to do so, yet he volunteered it to the police. That increases his overall veracity. Another major difficulty in disbelieving his evidence about who arrived and when is that not one question was addressed to him in cross-examination to suggest that he was wrong. A difficulty in disbelieving the mother is that though her evidence about the son was challenged as being made up, as it were, to give the friend a defence on grounds of want of opportunity, she strongly rejected this suggestion and no attempt was made to shake her. And a difficulty in disbelieving all three witnesses is that, unless their evidence was in essence true, it would have been prudent for them to have agreed in advance on what should be said. Yet it was never suggested in cross-examination that this had happened, and the complaints of the complainant to persons other than her mother were made so speedily as to leave virtually no time for any pre-concert of stories.  
      
       
     43 The appellant complains briefly about the failure of the Crown to call the son, who according to the complainant’s mother, arrived just after she left the friend alone. The transcript does not record any complaint about that at the trial. Nor does it record any objection to the mother’s evidence about the son. The appellant’s team at the trial obviously saw no vice in the Crown’s conduct, and it may be inferred that there was in truth no vice in it.  
      
       
     44 The fact is that questions about the timing of the family movements do not seem to have loomed large for most of the trial, to judge from the absence of cross-examination of the friend on that subject. In view of the mother’s evidence about the son, and the failure to object to it or challenge it vigorously, to have called the son might well have been open to the charge that the Crown were merely duplicating the evidence already given by both the mother and the friend, which was not contradicted in any way. 
      
       
     45 Full regard must be paid to the fact that the jury was entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and they had the benefit denied to this Court of seeing the witnesses. In view of the strength of the case, and in view of the way in which the trial judge exposed to the jury the difficulties in the Crown’s case, it is not possible to conclude that the verdicts were incapable of being supported by the evidence or were otherwise unreasonable. In M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492, followed in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 451, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
         
        
       
     46 The discrepancies within and inadequacies of the complainant’s evidence, and the discrepancies between it and that of others, related to relatively marginal matters. It would be astonishing – perhaps even a ground for suspicion – if a nine year old girl recalling events more than two years earlier, including the terms of complaints to her mother, the medical practitioner and the police, did not fall into error on such issues as the order of events, other details about them and precisely when she said what to whom. The appellant, however, has not demonstrated discrepancies and inadequacies in relation to the essential elements of the three crimes charged. It was not suggested that the evidence was “tainted” in the sense of proceeding from a conspiracy between the complainant, her mother and the friend, nor could it be in view of the lack of cross-examination to that effect and the other circumstances. Nor has it been shown that the evidence lacks probative force in its central elements. In all the circumstances, including the circumstances that crimes unquestionably occurred, that the appellant had opportunities to commit them, and that no other person had an opportunity to commit them, there is no reasonable possibility that the appellant was innocent.  
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
        
       
     47 Ground 4 is: 
      
       
        
         
         “A miscarriage of justice occurred due to the failure by the appellant’s legal representatives to put before the Court evidence available to the Appellant at his trial to explain the circumstances under which the Appellant elected not to give evidence at the trial … . “ 
         
        
       
     48 This ground is supported by an affidavit dated 14 February 2002 and sworn by the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. His affidavit says: 
      
       
        
         
         “I was aware of medical problems experienced by the Appellant as set out in the report of Dr Cameron dated 20 July 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         Given the directions that I was aware the trial judge was required to give where an accused does not give evidence, after the Appellant decided not to give evidence I did not consider that evidence as to the Appellant’s medical condition was necessary or particularly helpful to the Appellant’s case.  
         
        
        
         
         The Appellant had elected not to give evidence because of the problems he was having medically, because he had already given a detailed account of his actions on the day in question denying any wrong-doing with the Complainant (in a record of interview conducted with police) and finally, because he had been made aware that he would be subject to cross-examination if he gave evidence and that his credibility could potentially be undermined during cross-examination. He was also advised of the general nature of the directions that the trial judge would be required to give in relation to his election not to give evidence.” 
         
        
       
     49 Dr Cameron’s report records that the appellant was suffering from inflammatory bowel disease which left him physically drained and necessitated a number of admissions to hospital. He also suffered from seizures. Dr Cameron described the consequences of a severe assault on 20 June 2000, which caused a number of broken bones and major blood loss. Dr Cameron said that the appellant was taking Panadeine Forte for severe pain, which made him drowsy and affected his mental processes. He also said that the appellant was complaining of headaches affecting his concentration. He said that the appellant was not physically or mentally capable of attending court because his level of pain combined with the nature of his medication would adversely affect his ability to give evidence. He said that the appellant would not be fit to attend court for another two to three months.  
      
       
     50 An affidavit of 12 February 2002 affirmed by the appellant verified the account of his symptoms recorded by Dr Cameron. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of his affidavit state: 
      
       
        
         
         “At the time of my trial I was still having problems with drowsiness, concentration, mental state and headaches and I continue to experience difficulties in that regard. 
         
        
        
         
         I told my lawyers about the problems I was experiencing at the time of my trial. Given the problems I was having and because I had given a police record of interview, after receiving advice, I elected not to give evidence. I am not aware as to why no evidence was led on my behalf by those representing me at my trial to explain why I elected not to give evidence in the matter.” 
         
        
       
     51 The appellant submitted that “notwithstanding the protective directions given to the jury (see Summing Up T21)”, he “was deprived of a significant chance of acquittal because … the jury were not told of his explanation for electing not to give evidence”. The appellant also submitted that “there is no adequate explanation as to why such evidence was not put before the jury by legal representatives for the Appellant”.  
      
       
     52 This ground of appeal must fail.  
      
       
     53 First, it is in my experience unprecedented that evidence should be placed before the jury as to why an accused person elects not to give evidence, save for cases where the accused is of low mental capacity or impaired mental capacity. Yet the submission appears to proceed upon the basis that that is a normal practice. Counsel did concede it is rare, particularly since the abolition of dock statements.  
      
       
     54 Secondly, if the jury were to be told anything about why the appellant did not want to give evidence, it would be misleading if they were not told the totality of his position. Among the reasons why, according to counsel’s affidavit, the accused elected not to give evidence, was the fear that “his credibility could potentially be undermined during cross-examination”. Revelation of that motive would have been far more damaging to the appellant’s position than the unexplained failure to give evidence. While Dr Cameron may have been able to give admissible evidence about the appellant’s health, he could not have given evidence about the tactical decision to rely on the self-serving parts of the record of interview and on the trial judge’s directions. If information about that decision were to be communicated to the jury by anyone other than the appellant, it could only be communicated by one of the appellant’s lawyers. To communicate it would waive privilege, and the Crown could have elicited in cross-examination the fears of the appellant’s camp about cross-examination of the appellant on credibility.  
      
       
     55 Thirdly, so far as the motivation of the appellant turned on his bad health, there was some evidence that at the time of the trial he suffered from bowel problems.  
      
       
     56 Fourthly, the trial judge directed the jury in accordance with the principles laid down by the majority in Azzopardi v R (2001) 75 ALJR 931, even though that case was decided after the appellant’s trial. That direction left the appellant in a much better position than any evidence as to his actual motivation would have. It told the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn, and that they were not to infer guilt from silence.  
      
       
     57 Finally, it has not been demonstrated that the failure to call the evidence complained of would have caused the appellant to lose any chance of acquittal whatever.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 1 and 2 
        
       
     58 Grounds 1 and 2 are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant has available to him fresh evidence the absence of which at trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice (refer Annexure “A”). 
         
        
        
         
         There is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the Appellant if the new evidence had been before them” 
         
        
       
     59 Annexure A to Ground 1 is a two page report by Dr Brian L McDonald dated 12 February 2002. It forms part of an affidavit affirmed by Dr McDonald on 13 February 2002. That affidavit annexes an extensive statement of Dr McDonald’s qualifications and experience, and also his report.  
      
       
     60 The Crown opposed the reception of the evidence on the ground that it had to be shown that it was unavailable without the exercise of reasonable diligence, and this was not shown; that it was not cogent; and that it was not likely to give rise to a reasonable doubt. The court decided to admit the evidence provisionally so that the last two of the Crown’s points could be properly considered. In relation to diligence, an affidavit was read on behalf of the Crown sworn by Stephen Murray Thomson dated 5 March 2002.  
      
       
     61 The question is whether Dr McDonald’s evidence reveals that there was a miscarriage of justice at trial within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
      
       
     62 In Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518.6-520.3 Barwick CJ (McTiernan, Stephen and Jacobs JJ) said:  
      
       
        
         
         “In every situation the court must decide on the relevance of the new evidence, even in the case of a reference by the Attorney-General such as the present. It must decide its credibility, that is to say whether or not it is capable of belief, both as to veracity and competence in the case of oral evidence, and as to authenticity in the case of documentary evidence. But in some situations, as I shall point out, the court will decide whether it believes the evidence. In other situations it will be enough that, whatever its own view, the evidence is capable of belief, and likely to be believed, by reasonable men. 
         
        
        
         
         Having considered relevance and credibility, the court will weigh the cogency of the evidence, having in mind always the evidence produced at the trial. That evidence will be taken in that sense in which, having regard to its verdict, the jury must have accepted it. 
         
        
        
         
         For all these purposes the court may see and hear the witnesses of the new evidence, both Crown and appellant being entitled to examine and cross-examine as the case may be. Further, the court will be entitled to receive evidence which tends to support, contradict or weaken the new evidence or the inferences which might be drawn therefrom. 
         
        
        
         
         It is now necessary to differentiate the use which the court may make of the new evidence according to which of the instances of miscarriage it is considering. If the court is considering whether the verdict of guilty should be set aside outright for the reason that innocence is shown, or the existence of an appropriate doubt established, the court will consider all the material itself, forming and acting upon its own belief in, or disbelief of, the evidence, and upon its own view of the facts of the case including the evidence at the trial, though, as I have said, taking the facts as proved at the trial in the sense which having regard to its verdict the jury must have taken them. Of course, if it is concluded that there was a miscarriage in the sense that the court itself is satisfied of innocence or entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, there will be no question of a new trial. The verdict of guilty will be quashed and the appellant discharged. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, when the material before the court satisfies the court of a miscarriage of this kind, it will not matter that the new material or some part of it is not fresh evidence, in the sense that it was not or could not have been available at the time of the trial. Thus, until the court decides that there is no miscarriage of this kind, it will not need to consider whether or not any part of the new evidence satisfied the criterion of fresh evidence. The court’s acceptance that guilt beyond reasonable doubt is not established, means inevitably that to maintain the verdict of guilty would be a miscarriage of justice. Also, as I have already said, it will not matter in such a case that the trial was fair and without blemish. 
         
        
        
         
         But if the material before the court of criminal appeal does not convince the court of such a miscarriage, or if the appellant’s claim is only for a new trial, the fact that the new material is not wholly fresh evidence in the sense I have described will be material. I have already pointed out that the non-production by the accused of evidence available to him at the trial – available actually or constructively in the sense I have mentioned – will not make the trial in any sense unfair. 
         
        
        
         
         But there is the situation where, although the trial so far has been fair, evidence is discovered after the verdict which could not reasonably have been available at the trial: that is to say, fresh evidence is produced to the court of criminal appeal. The claim on behalf of the appellant, whether as an alternative to a claim to the absolute quashing of the conviction, or as his sole claim, is that without the consideration of the fresh evidence by the jury a miscarriage will have occurred: the trial will not have been a fair trial. In this situation, the court must as before decide the credibility and the cogency of the fresh evidence in order to determine whether, when the fresh evidence, if believed by the jury, is taken with the evidence given at the trial in that sense most favourable to the accused which reasonable men might property accept, it is likely that a verdict of guilty would not have been returned. In considering the material before it for this purpose, the element of credibility will be satisfied if the court is of opinion that the evidence is capable of belief and likely to be believed by a jury. The court in this instance will not be directly acting upon its own view of the evidence but rather upon that view most favourable to an appellant, which in the court’s view a jury of reasonable men may properly take. Of course, it may be said, as was said in  
         Stafford v Director of Public Prosecutions 
          [(28) [1974] AC 878] that the view of the court must be taken to be a reasonable one, and a contrary view, by whomsoever held, to be an unreasonable one: and no doubt at times this must be so. But I conceive that there may be reasonable views of facts which do not commend themselves to the court which do not become unreasonable because the court does not entertain them. In the situation with which I am presenting dealing, namely of fresh evidence not claimed to establish innocence but to be of such credibility and cogency as to be likely to influence a jury away from a verdict of guilty, it is what a reasonable jury might reasonably make of this evidence which is the dominant consideration. Of course, if the court thinks that there is no doubt that its own view of the evidence is the only reasonable view, it will act upon that view as one upon which the jury would be bound to act.”  
         
        
       
     63 In Lawless v R (1979) 142 CLR 659 at 674-5 Mason J said that Barwick CJ had correctly stated the relevant principles; Barwick CJ (not surprisingly) and Aickin J agreed.  
      
       
     64 Accordingly the first question is whether Dr McDonald’s evidence causes this Court either to conclude that the appellant was innocent or to experience a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  
      
       
     65 Dr McDonald’s evidence should not cause this Court to conclude either that the appellant was innocent or that there was a reasonable doubt. Indeed the appellant does not invite the court to come to either conclusion. Rather he invites the court to conclude that the jury would have acquitted or, at least, that there was a significant possibility of that outcome had Dr McDonald’s evidence been before it. The appellant’s submission was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Dr McDonald’s conclusion is noted that ‘it is 20 times more likely that a single person of type 1+2+ [the complainant’s mother’s friend] contributed to the stain on the Complainant’s underpants than two people, one of type 1+ (the Complainant) and the other 2+ (the Appellant) contributed to the stain’. It is also noted Dr McDonald’s conclusion that ‘if a person of type 1+ is a contributor then it is 7 times more likely for a second person to be a 1+2+ type than a 2+ type’. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that on the basis of Mr Goetz’s evidence (see paragraphs 2.9 and 2.10 above) the jury were left with the proposition that the stain on the Complainant’s underpants emanated from either the Appellant or [the complainant’s mother’s friend], and that it was equally likely that it emanated from one or the other. 
         
        
        
         
         If Dr McDonald had given evidence before the jury in accordance with his report, it is submitted that it is likely the jury would have formed the view that it was significantly more probable that the stain on the underpants emanated from [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and not from the Appellant. Arguably, that would lead them to conclude that there was a significant possibility that some kind of sexual impropriety occurred between [the complainant’s mother’s friend] and the Complainant. In the context of the Complainant’s denial of any such impropriety, it is submitted that her overall credibility would be diminished to such a significant extent that there is a significant likelihood that the jury would not be able to accept her version beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the counts, and that not guilty verdicts would be returned:  
         Mickelberg 
          (1989) 43 A Crim R 182;  
         Zaidi 
          (1991) 57 A Crim R 189;  
         Frawley 
          (1993) 69 A Crim R 208;  
         PLV 
          51 NSWLR 736.” 
         
        
       
     66 It is to be noted that the appellant does not claim that Dr McDonald’s evidence excludes him as a possible wrongdoer, and it does not. Quite independently of the fact that the appellant did not ask the court to conclude that the appellant was innocent or that there was a reasonable doubt, the reasons why the evidence does not cause a conclusion of innocence to be arrived at or a reasonable doubt to be experienced are that the complainant’s evidence is basically credible both as to her experiences with the appellant and with her lack of maltreatment by the friend; the evidence of the friend, too, in view of its self-disparaging nature is credible; and, as noted earlier, important parts of the complainant’s evidence are confirmed by the appellant in his record of interview (as to not wearing underpants), by the complaint to the complainant’s mother, by the complaint to the medical practitioner, and by the complaint to the police.  
      
       
     67 Accordingly it is necessary to consider whether, had the evidence of Dr McDonald been before the jury, they would have acquitted or whether there was a significant possibility of that outcome. Let it be assumed, contrary to what Barwick CJ said, that the question whether the evidence relied on could with reasonable diligence have been produced at the trial should be put aside. (Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395 said that that “is not a universal and inflexible requirement: the strength of the fresh evidence may in some cases be such as to justify interference with the verdict, even though that evidence might have been discovered before the trial.”) The fact is that the appellant’s submissions are no more than an appeal to speculation. They are replete with words such as “if”, “arguably” and “possibility”. Up to a point that form of argument, which is designed to generate the possibility of the jury having a reasonable doubt, is permissible, but possibility is heaped on assumption to far too great an extent. The submissions depend on there being a reasonable possibility of sexual impropriety between the friend and the complainant. The only time when this could have occurred was after the complainant’s mother left her house and before she or anyone else returned. The appellant’s case creates contradictions: on the one hand it is said that the complainant’s brother arrived too soon for the friend to do what he said he did; on the other hand it is said the friend had time to assault the complainant. The existence of disparities between the recollections of the mother, the friend and the complainant, even if they existed, which they do not, is immaterial in view of the fact that they do not demonstrate a reasonable possibility of an opportunity to assault the complainant. Even if Dr McDonald’s conclusions as to probabilities are correct, it is not reasonably contestable that some crime was committed against the complainant, and there is no satisfactory evidence that the friend had an opportunity to commit it.  
      
       
     68 The question of Dr McDonald’s evidence was the topic of the bulk of the vigorous oral argument advanced by Mr W C Terracini, SC, who appeared with Mr G A Newton for the appellant. At an early stage in the appellant’s argument, it was apparently suggested that the appellant’s advisers before the trial had failed to understand the significance of mixing the bodily fluids of either the complainant and the appellant or the complainant and the friend or whether the fluid on the underpants was only that of the friend. The appellant submitted that if the Crown could not make out that there was DNA from the victim on the under garment then the DNA evidence goes nowhere. 
      
       
     69 After an adjournment, the appellant’s counsel was taken to a report on behalf of the appellant dated 31 July 2000 prepared by Genetic Technologies Corporation Pty Limited of Fitzroy, Victoria. That report stated that the DNA on a portion of the complainant’s underclothes was female, the only possible female source being the complainant. The appellant then refined the submission and said that the question did not turn on DNA testing but on PGM testing and on the mixing of fluid from two sources. It is hard to understand why the possibility of PGM testing and its relationship to the mixing of fluids did not occur to the appellant’s lawyers at trial if it were thought profitable to do so. 
      
       
     70 The report of Dr Goetz, served by the Crown, on which his evidence at the trial was presumably based, dealt with that subject. Trial counsel, as has been seen, swore an affidavit in respect to other aspects of the trial. That affidavit did not deal with that subject. The date of the affidavit was 14 February 2002. Dr McDonald’s affidavit was sworn on 13 February 2002. The issue was thus present to the mind of the appellant’s lawyers when they were in contact with trial counsel. The appellant’s counsel conceded that Dr McDonald’s report did not rule his client out. He said that there was a significant possibility that it would have made a difference at the trial because “scientific material has the weight of impartiality and carries with it far greater effect than evidence from lay persons merely saying what they saw and heard.” While that may sometimes be true, it is not true in the circumstances of this case. 
      
       
     71 The appellant’s submissions set out above rely on Dr McDonald’s evidence on probabilities. The jury would have been likely to give it much less weight than and, indeed, not to give it any significance in comparison with, the evidence which they did accept, namely: 
      
       
     (a) that the complainant had plainly been abused; 
      
       
       (b) that only two persons could have abused her; 
        
       (c) that the appellant had lengthy opportunities to do so; 
        
       (d) that the time within which the friend could have done so was at most about one hour and all the evidence, namely, that of the friend, the mother and the mother’s report of what her son said, pointed to the fact that there were only a few minutes within which the complainant was present; 
        
       (e) that the complainant gave essentially convincing evidence that the accused was the person responsible for abusing her; 
        
       (f) that that was confirmed by the appellant’s submission that he only wore underpants. There was no suggestion that the complainant could have acquired knowledge about his habitual non-wearing of underpants on any occasion other than that of which the complainant complained; 
        
       (g) that her evidence was confirmed by substantially similar complaints to her mother, the medical practitioner and the police, all of which identified the appellant as the offender; 
        
       (h) that it was never suggested to the friend that he used a vacuum cleaner on the day in question on the complainant. The vacuum cleaner in evidence was before this court and, as counsel for the appellant said, it was a large industrial type of vacuum cleaner. He did not say, but, in my opinion, it is correct to say, that it was the type of vacuum cleaner not usually found in domestic households. The complainant drew a diagram of it, which was before the court. 
        
       
     72 In the course of argument in this Court, some stress was placed on questions of opportunity. The fact is that the friend’s denial of opportunity was never challenged by a single question at the trial. Counsel for the appellant declined to advance a R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 submission on that point or any other point. For that reason, Dr McDonald’s evidence is unlikely to have changed the verdict of the jury or led to any other result. There is no significant possibility that there would have been any other result before this jury or a reasonable hypothetical jury. 
      
       
     73 In any event, no explanation is offered by Dr McDonald as to why his evidence was not tendered at the trial. Nor, despite the evidence from the appellant and Mr O’Donnell about why evidence relating to the appellant’s election not to testify took place, is there any other evidence explaining why Dr McDonald’s evidence was not tendered at the trial. Counsel for the appellant conceded there was no adequate explanation. The appellant does not suggest that the reports of Ms Briese and Mr Goetz, on which their evidence at the trial was based, were not available to the appellant for a significant time before the trial. There is also evidence that on 6 July 2000 the appellant’s solicitors were served with a statement dated 30 June 2000 by the friend asserting that on 13 February 1997 he had a vasectomy, and that on 6 July the Crown indicated willingness for the complainant’s underpants to be tested in Victoria by a company of the appellant’s choice. On 31 July the appellant’s solicitors received a report on that test from Genetic Technologies Corporation Pty Limited. On 12 September 2000 the appellant’s solicitors indicated to the Crown by telephone a desire for further testing and the Crown indicated its co-operation. In the meantime, on 16 August 2000, the appellant had obtained an adjournment of the trial fixed for that day in part because of the desire to have further testing carried out. On 13 September 2000 a letter from the appellant’s solicitors in relation to the further testing was sent. It is plain that the appellant’s advisers were alive to the possible utility in the case of forensic evidence. In those circumstances it is not possible to infer that there is any explanation for their failure to call evidence in the nature of that which Dr McDonald has now given, that it would not now materially exist in the client’s interests. 
      
       
     74 It is necessary to return to the question of whether the appellant’s Ground 3 arguments, taken with Dr McDonald’s evidence, would result in that ground being upheld. For the reasons just given, they could not. Accordingly, Dr McDonald’s evidence should be rejected. Grounds 1 and 2 fail.  
      
       
        
       Additional ground: sentence 
        
       
     75 At the hearing the appellant applied for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. No reasons for this were advanced in written submissions. However, in the course of oral argument, it became plain that the appellant’s contentions concentrated simply on the fact the sentence was excessive taking into account the appellant’s record. 
      
       
     76 The crimes of which the appellant was convicted were serious ones. The only basis on which lenient sentencing could take place would be subjective considerations. The sentencing judge took into account the fact that the appellant had no prior convictions for any sexual offences, and no prior offences resulting in imprisonment. He took into account the fact that the appellant married early in 1998 and had a small child. He also took into account evidence of the appellant’s ill health. In all the circumstances I am unable to see any error in the sentencing process, or to conclude that the duration of the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
        
       Role of trial counsel 
        
       
     77 In the foregoing reasons mention has been made of various decisions by counsel for the appellant at the trial, and various instances when particular courses of conduct were not undertaken. It is not intended to suggest that this reflects any incompetence on the part of counsel. In each case it can be seen that the appellant’s counsel was confronted with a difficult tactical choice. It does not follow from the actual choices made and from the conduct that was and was not undertaken that counsel behaved in a manner outside the range of a sound professional discretion. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     78 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       1. The appeals against conviction are dismissed. 
        
        
       2. The applications for leave to appeal on sentence are refused. 
       
     79 DUNFORD J: I agree.80 BUDDIN J: I also agree.81 HEYDON JA: Those two orders are the orders of the court.

      70053/01 - REGINA v SNEZA SUTESKI 
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 4] - Re admissibility of tender of ERISP of Witness ""B"" 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Application is made by the Crown under s65(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (""the Act"") to tender a video recorded interview of a person said not to be available to give evidence. The person I shall refer to as Witness ""B"", is alleged by the Crown to have been an accomplice of the accused, Ms Sneza Suteski. 
     
      
    2 The accused has been charged with the murder of Mr Richard Peich. Mr Peich died on 20 December 1999. During 1999 Ms Suteski worked in the accounts department of a car dealer, Newman's of Kogarah. Mr Peich was the accountant of that company, and Ms Suteski's immediate superior. Ms Suteski defrauded her employer by diverting cash from the company's bank account to her own bank account, or the accounts of persons sympathetic to her. The Crown alleges that to better accomplish or complete such fraud she needed Mr Peich away from work. Ms Suteski, therefore, according to the Crown, approached Witness B, asking that he assault Mr Peich or recruit someone to do so. Witness B, in his turn, arranged for a friend (here referred to as Witness ""W""), to undertake that task. On 20 December 1999, Witness W repeatedly stabbed Mr Peich. Mr Peich died almost at once. 
     
      
    3 Witness W and Witness B and Ms Suteski were arrested on 25 January 2000. Witness B's girlfriend, Ms Kaycee Salem, was also arrested. All were interviewed by the police. The present application concerns the interview given by Witness B on that occasion. 
     
      
    4 On 1 December 2000, Witness B pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of procuring Witness W to maliciously wound Richard Peich. In the proceedings on sentence, Witness B did not offer to assist the Crown. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years, with a non parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    5 Witness W was charged with murder. He also pleaded guilty. However, he offered to assist the Crown, undertaking to give evidence against Ms Suteski. He was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, with a non parole period of fifteen years. The term was significantly reduced by reason of his offer of assistance. 
     
      
    6 Ms Kaycee Salem was also charged, although with a lesser offence. She likewise offered to give assistance. The charges against her were ultimately withdrawn, and she was provided with an Indemnity signed by the Attorney General. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case at Trial 
       
      
    7 The issue in this trial is really quite narrow. There is no issue that Ms Suteski defrauded her employer. The indictment against the accused included nine counts of having obtained money by deception. Ms Suteski pleaded guilty to each count. She also acknowledged her guilt in respect of sixty-eight additional offences, which were included on a Form 1 signed by her. The amount involved in the fraud is approximately $285,000. She began taking money in August 1999. Ms Suteski continued to do so after the murder and until 19 January 2000, that is, a matter of days before her arrest. 
     
      
    8 There appears to be no substantial issue concerning whether Ms Suteski sought to arrange some form of physical assault upon Mr Peich. Ms Suteski's former boyfriend, Mr Bradley Barnes, gave the following evidence of a conversation with the accused: (T313) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I asked her why she couldn't come home, why she was in trouble for? She briefly explained to me that some guys, she had some guys to rough up a guy from her work and they stuffed up and killed him. And that's pretty much it, about the phone call. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she use that term, 'rough up'? 
         
        A. Yes."" 
        
       
      
    9 Mr Barnes was not cross examined to suggest that account was false or inaccurate. 
     
      
    10 When Ms Suteski was interviewed, she said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q51 Is there anything else you wish to say about that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I, I would like to talk at a further stage when I can speak to my solicitor. But again, I did not kill Richard Peich. Things went out of hand and I, I don't know what happened, so, but I did not kill him."" 
        
       
      
    11 Ms Kaycee Salem and Witness W have each given evidence. They have recounted conversations with Ms Suteski. Witness W attributed to Ms Suteski the following words: (T48) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Well I asked, 'How do you want this guy hurt?', and she just said, 'Bash him. Stab him. Kill him. I don't give a fuck what you do to him, as long as he doesn't show up for work.'"" 
        
       
      
    12 It was suggested in cross examination that this evidence was false. Apart from that suggestion, there has been a general attack upon the reliability of both witnesses. 
     
      
       
      The unavailability of Witness B 
       
      
    13 Witness B is in gaol serving the sentence imposed in June 2001. He refused to give evidence at committal. When called on the voir dire, Witness B gave the following answers to questions from me: (T166) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You understand that this is a trial concerning Sneza Suteski? 
         
        A. Yeah correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you're going to be asked questions in relation to the events preceding 20 December 1999? 
         
        A. I don't wish to say anything about this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is that? 
         
        A. No comment. I just, I don't want nothing to do with this. I don't want to say anything about this court case. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why is that? 
         
        A. No comment. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see, you have already been dealt with so you have nothing to fear about it, have you? 
         
        A. I don't have anything to fear. I just don't have nothing to say about this matter."" 
        
       
      
    14 Witness B's attention was drawn to the Court's power to direct him to answer questions, and to punish for contempt, should he refuse to do so. That notwithstanding, Witness B maintained his refusal. He said this: (T167) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Knowing that, you say that you will not answer questions relating to this case? 
         
        A. I will not answer any questions regarding this matter. I will give you my name, that's it. Apart from that, that's it."" 
        
       
      
    15 During the voir dire, the solicitor for Witness B in the sentencing proceedings was present in court. Through that solicitor, arrangements were made for Witness B to have counsel's advice. Mr Haesler of counsel was retained. On the third day of the trial, Witness B was again brought to court. On this occasion he refused to take the oath. Mr Haesler, on his behalf, made the following statement in the presence of the jury: (T204) 
     
      
       
        
        ""For reasons unconnected with this case, (Witness B) refused to be sworn or to give evidence in this trial."" 
        
       
      
    16 Witness B was then stood down to enable the Crown to consider its position. The Crown has sought to tender the video interview with Witness B upon the basis that he is, within the meaning of the Act, ""unavailable to give evidence"", creating the right to tender an account of his evidence by other means (s65). 
     
      
    17 The Act, in the dictionary, defines the expression, ""unavailability of persons"" (s4(1)). There are a number of categories. They include persons who are dead, not competent, or who are missing. They also include the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s4(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
        
       
       
        
        (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success."" 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Byrne SC acknowledged that the Crown had taken all reasonable steps to compel Witness B to give evidence. That acknowledgment simply recognised that the sanction of contempt, in the context of Witness B, is unlikely to change his mind. 
     
      
    19 I accept, therefore, that Witness B is, for the purposes of the act, unavailable to give evidence. 
     
      
       
      The exception provided by s65 
       
      
    20 Section 65, relevantly, is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s65(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made."" 
        
       
      
    21 The Crown relied s65(2)(c) and (d), although most of its submissions were directed to sub-section (d). Aspects of Witness B's account may be regarded as highly probable (the introductory words and inconsequential information provided). However, his position, as an accomplice, makes it difficult to have that degree of confidence in his account that it could be characterised as ""highly reliable"". I will approach the matter upon the basis of s65(2)(d). In respect of that sub-section, the Act makes the following further provision: 
     
      
       
        
        ""65(7) Without limiting paragraph (2)(d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that paragraph to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends: 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted;"" 
        
       
      
    22 Witness B's interview took place on the date of his arrest. He had not yet been convicted. 
     
      
    23 Counsel for Ms Suteski drew attention to the structure of s65. Witness B would give ""evidence"" by means of the video. Counsel pointed to s65(3), (4) and (5), which dealt with an analogous situation, namely the use that can be made of evidence previously given by a person who becomes unavailable. The Act, in that circumstance, incorporated safeguards to protect the accused. Such evidence can only be given where the party against whom it is tendered has cross examined the unavailable witness, or has had a reasonable opportunity of doing so (s65(3)). Section 65(8), it was submitted, is a further indication of a legislative policy of protecting the rights of the accused. 
     
      
    24 The submission appeared to be that s65(2) should be construed by reference to the philosophy which is apparent in other sub-sections. However, s65(3), (4) and (5) deal with a particular situation, previously dealt with by s409 Crimes Act, 1900. Section 65(2) must be construed on its own terms, by reference to the words which appear in that sub-section. 
     
      
    25 It was further submitted that the statements by Witness B cannot be characterised as being against his interests. The statement, ""Ms Suteski gave me instructions to arrange the bashing of Richard Peich"" was not, it was submitted, against the interests of Witness B, so far as it identifies Mr Suteski. Only that part of the statement in which he acknowledged an instruction from someone (unnamed) came within s65(2)(d). 
     
      
    26 Such an approach is, I believe, too narrow. Statements by Witness B, tending to implicate him in a joint criminal enterprise with Ms Suteski, may be characterised as against his interest. Having said that, each statement in the interview, each representation, must be examined in order to determine whether it may be regarded as a statement against interest (ss(2)(d)).  
     
      
    27 Counsel for the accused also drew attention to Witness B's position as an accomplice. Whilst his statements may be incriminating (and to that extent, against his interests), he, nonetheless, may well be serving his own interests, as s165(1)(d) of the Act recognises. In this case, Witness B's position was complicated by his girlfriend having been arrested. It is likely that he also had her interests in mind as he answered questions, endeavouring to insulate her from prosecution. In these circumstances, it was submitted, the statements by Witness B cannot be characterised as ""against interest"". 
     
      
    28 Whilst unquestionably Witness B may have had mixed motives when providing the answers he gave, those answers were, with some exceptions, objectively against his interests at the time they were made. 
     
      
       
      The rule against second hand hearsay 
       
      
    29 It was further submitted that the proposed evidence would offend the hearsay rule, in that its presentation would inevitably involve second hand hearsay. The Act, of course, permits only first hand hearsay (s62). Counsel for Ms Suteski drew attention to the opening words of s65(2), which for convenience I repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s65(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was: ..."" 
        
       
      
    30 It was said that statements by Witness B in the interview, where he attributed words and actions to Ms Suteski, or Witness W, or others, were representations of fact. Section 65(2) required that someone who had seen, heard, or otherwise perceived the representation being made, should give evidence of the representation (cf R v Souleyman (unreported, Smart J, 23.5.96)). That process involves a person (in this case the police officer) who was present at the interview, repeating the representation for the purposes of proving the truth of the representation (Lee v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 594). That, it was submitted, would be second hand hearsay, and therefore offend s62. 
     
      
    31 However, I believe the submission misstates the hearsay rule. Witness B, when he spoke the words in the interview, was describing events in which he was a participant, or which he witnessed. It was a direct account, not involving hearsay. Where he related what was said to him, his statements may or may not have been hearsay. In circumstances where Witness B repeated to the police assertions of fact by someone else, and where the only relevance of such evidence was the facts asserted, it is hearsay. Its repetition by the police officer, when giving evidence of the interview, would involve second hand hearsay. It must therefore be excluded. 
     
      
    32 Where, however, Witness B was relating to the police the words of Ms Suteski in respect of the request said to have been made by her, such words are not hearsay. Rather, they are a description of what occurred. They are what used to be described as ""verbal acts"" or ""operative words"". Their repetition by the police when giving evidence of the interview (through the tender of tapes) does not offend the rule in respect of first hand hearsay. 
     
      
    33 Accordingly, I do not believe that the police officer who participated in the interview is prevented, by s62, from giving evidence of previous representations made by Witness B in the course of the interview. Particular statements may offend the rule against first hand hearsay, as in the illustration given above. The material should be examined in order to exclude such statements. 
     
      
    34 There was debate as to the form in which the evidence, if admitted, should be given. Mr Byrne SC, counsel for the accused, contended that the only permissible way in which it may be given, having regard to the opening words of s65(2), is by a police officer reading onto the record what was said. That, he submitted, may be inconvenient. However, it was required by the Act. I do not accept that submission. Section 65(2) identifies the qualifications of the person who may give evidence. He or she must be a person who ""saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made"". However, the sub-section does not specify the form in which such evidence may be given by such a person. I believe, if admitted, the evidence should be given in the usual way, by playing the video, excising any portion that may be objectionable. 
     
      
    35 I have seen the interview for the purposes of determining this application. Witness B is particularly hard to understand, first, because he has an accent, and secondly, because of his manner of speech. A transcript (amended to reflect the video) should be made available to the jury as an aide memoir, if the material is admitted. 
     
      
    36 It is my view that, subject to issues of discretion, which I will now address, the evidence is admissible under s65(2). 
     
      
       
      Exclusion of the evidence 
       
      
    37 Section 135 of the Act provides, relevantly, that the Court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial to any party. However, in a criminal trial, the more exacting standard, which the evidence must meet, is that set out in s137, which is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""s137 In a criminal proceeding, the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 
        
       
      
    38 In R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61, the Court (Sheller JA, James and Dowd JJ) described the nature of the task required by s137. It said this: (para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""19. When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion. ..."" 
        
       
      
    39 The Court added: (para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... Translated to the task set by s137, a trial judge's estimate of how the probative value should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice will be one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge's own trial experience. In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment."" 
        
       
      
    40 The approach which must be taken was described in these terms: (para 20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""20. Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not other admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected."" 
        
       
      
    41 The term ""probative value"" is defined by the Dictionary in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue."" 
        
       
      
    42 The Australian Law Reform Commission, in the context of the companion provision, s135(a), and the phrase ""unfairly prejudicial"", said this: (ALRC 26 Vol 1 para 644) 
     
      
       
        
        ""By risk of unfair prejudice is meant the danger that the fact-finder may use the evidence to make a decision on an improper, perhaps emotional, basis, ie on a basis logically unconnected with the issues in the case. Thus evidence that appeals to the fact-finder's sympathies, arouses a sense of horror, provokes an instinct to punish, or triggers other mainsprings of human action may cause the fact-finder to base his decision on something other than the established propositions in the case. Similarly, on hearing the evidence the fact-finder may be satisfied with a lower degree of probability than would otherwise be required."" 
        
       
      
    43 In R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ, Newman and Sully JJ) identified the meaning of unfair prejudice in these words: (para 52) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In connection with the proper exercise of that statutory discretion, his Honour was required to bear in mind, among other things, a proposition that cannot be put more clearly and succinctly than is done in the relevant portion of the Australian Law Reform Commission Report which is quoted in Odgers: Uniform Evidence Law: 3rd Edition at 447: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'There is some uncertainty over the meaning of 'prejudice'. But clearly, it does not mean simply damage to the accused's case. It means damage to the accused's case in some unacceptable way, by provoking some irrational, emotional response, or giving evidence more weight than it should have.'"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    44 Dunford J, in R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101, provided a helpful summary of the principle: (at 109) 
     
      
       
        
        ""All relevant evidence led in the Crown case at trial is prejudicial to the accused, but it is only that of which the probative value is outweighed by the danger of  
        unfair  
        prejudice which is excluded; that is, evidence which has only slight probative value but which carries with it a probability that it be misused by the tribunal of fact in a way logically unconnected with the issues in the case:  
        R v Lockyer 
         (1996) 89 A Crim R 457; see also  
        R v Singh-Bal 
         (1997) 92 A Crim R 397."" 
        
       
      
    45 The evidence of Witness B is obviously relevant. Mr Byrne SC, for Ms Suteski, did not contend otherwise. Witness B is alleged by the Crown to have been the person approached by Ms Suteski in order to harm Mr Peich. His interview includes his account of conversations with Ms Suteski, and his actions in consequence. An assessment of the probative value, required by s137, involves an evaluation of the worth of such evidence, and its capacity to rationally affect the assessment of facts in issue. The evidence must be examined in the context of other evidence in the trial. A number of records, according to the Crown, objectively support the account given by Witness B. Video surveillance evidence from the St George Leagues Club records the movements of various people on the evening of 20 December 1999, as described by Witness B. The phone records likewise support the account by Witness B of communication between the various participants that evening. 
     
      
    46 I accept, as a generality, that the evidence of Witness B has significant probative value. Some aspects are more cogent than others. I will deal with particular aspects of his evidence in the context of possible unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    47 Turning to that issue, many of Witness B's responses appear to carry no particular prejudice, unfair or otherwise. They relate to matters not seriously in issue. There are many examples. Ms Suteski's presence at the St George Leagues Club on the evening of Friday 20 December 1999 is an illustration. It is a significant aspect of the Crown case that Ms Suteski was present at the Leagues Club that evening (where Witness W lay in wait for Mr Peich). Her presence, however, was recorded on the surveillance video at the Club, and other records which form part of the Crown case. 
     
      
    48 The questions in the first part of the interview were reasonably open ended and non-leading. Having obtained Witness B's account, the police then put a number of suggestions to him for his comment. They were suggestions which had obviously come from others arrested the same day, Witness W and Ms Salem (Witness B's girlfriend) among them. Of particular concern is an allegation by Witness W made during his interview, which has been repeated in his evidence at this trial. The suggestion appears in the following questions put by the police to Witness B: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q.282 I've also been told that she said, 'Stab him, bash him, kill him if you want, I don't give a fuck as long as he doesn't go to work'? 
         
        A. Yeah. That's it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.283 Sorry? 
         
        A. Yeah, yeah, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.284 Do you recall her saying that? 
         
        A. Yeah, she said that a few times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.285 OK. Do you recall her using those words, 'Stab him, bash him, kill him if you want, I don't give a fuck as long as he doesn't go to work.'? 
         
        A. Something like that, but not the exact words, you know ... 
        
       
       
        
        Q.286 Words to that effect? 
         
        A. Yeah."" 
        
       
      
    49 Later in the interview the police put the same question again (Q.394). Witness B on that occasion responded: 
     
      
       
       ""Yeah, like, words like that."" 
       
      
    50 The probative value of that evidence, in my view, is less substantial than Witness B's own recollection, unprompted by suggestions made by others. In the context of a police interview, there may be the temptation, on the part of the person being interviewed, to ""go along"" with suggestions which are put where they are not perceived as directly touching the person's own interests. The statement put to Witness B did, objectively, affect his interests adversely. The words of Witness W suggested a somewhat more serious assault. Nonetheless, the suggestion was, in its terms, attributed to Ms Suteski. One may rather doubt that Witness B saw clearly the implications which it carried for him personally. 
     
      
    51 The actual words attributed to Ms Suteski by Witness W are important. The words themselves are striking. I do not doubt that they would resonate with the jury, reminding them of Witness W's evidence. Witness B does not adopt these words. Indeed, he says, that ""they are not the exact words"". Yet their reception into evidence is likely to be taken by the jury as confirmation that the words were said (notwithstanding Witness B's guarded response). Taken in that way, they would damage the accused's case, in my view, in an unacceptable way by provoking an emotional response or being given weight that they should not have. The potential for unfair prejudice is therefore substantial. In my view it outweighs the probative value of the evidence. The evidence must therefore be rejected. 
     
      
    52 Shortly before these answers by Witness B, certain other suggestions were put to Witness B by the police. The transcript of the interview included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q279 I've been told that Snez said words to the effect of break his knees or his legs, do you recall her saying that? 
         
        A. Beg yours? 
        
       
       
        
        Q280 Break his knees or his legs? 
         
        A. She wanted something like that."" 
        
       
      
    53 Some of the same considerations apply in respect of this material. The question by the police is a leading question. The answer does not have the probative force of an unprompted response from Witness B. Again, Witness B may not have recognised the implications for him personally, in his agreeing with the proposition which was put. Although it was objectively against his interests (and therefore qualifies under s65(2)(d)), its weight is less substantial because he may not have fully perceived that that was so. 
     
      
    54 Nonetheless, Witness B does, guardedly, adopt the suggestion. The words are not likely to resonate with the jury in the way that Witness W's words will. Balancing the probative value of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice, I believe that the probative value outweighs such prejudice. The material should be included. 
     
      
       
      Absence of notice 
       
      
    55 Witness B was foreshadowed as a Crown witness. His statement of 28 December 1999, and interview of 25 January 2000, were served as part of the Crown brief. 
     
      
    56 However, the Crown did not give notice in writing of its intention to adduce hearsay evidence in respect of Witness B, as required by s67(1). Nor was leave sought by the Crown under s192 for a direction under s67(4) that, despite the failure to give notice, s65(2) should apply. The presentation of Witness B's ""evidence"" by means of the video interview arose unexpectedly when Witness B refused to be sworn. When the admissibility of that material was argued, neither party adverted to the issue of notice under s67. 
     
      
    57 The material having been admitted, the Crown later drew my attention to this oversight. The matter was plainly one in which leave under s192(1) to give a direction under s67(4) was appropriate. The video evidence was relatively short (s192(2)(a)). It was plainly important (s192(2)(c)). Witness B was an accomplice to the murder (s192(2)(d)). He was the person who, on the Crown case, Ms Suteski approached in order to procure the assault upon Mr Peich. Mr Byrne SC, counsel for Ms Suteski, did not suggest any particular unfairness through the absence of notice. He acknowledged the issue arose unexpectedly (s192(2)(b)). Directions were given to excise certain parts of the interview, in accordance with these reasons (s192(2)(e)). 
     
      
    58 Mr Byrne, in these circumstances, did not oppose my giving a direction under s67(4) that s65(2) should apply, notwithstanding the absence of notice. I therefore give that direction. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    59 The parties should therefore examine the video and the transcript which accompanies it, isolating and excluding the following: 
     
      
    · First, those matters which, objectively, in the sense described in these reasons, are incapable of being described as against the interests of Witness B (such as his denial of allegations put to him by the police). 
     
      
    · Secondly, those matters which can only be known to Witness B through conversations with others (such as the reference to Witness W having been phoned by Ms Suteski). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, those matters where Witness B recounts conversations with others where the only relevance of those conversations is to prove the facts asserted (and therefore offend the rule requiring only first hand hearsay). 
     
      
    · Questions 282 to 286 should be excluded, as well as question 394 and any repetition of the same question.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentence imposed on the respondent by his Honour Judge Hosking SC in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 7 November 2001 following the respondent pleading guilty before a magistrate to two counts, firstly, a count of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and one count of demand money with menaces contrary to s 99 of the said Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
      
       
     2 He also asked that two other offences be taken into account in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely, one count of affray contrary to the provisions of s 93C of the Crimes Act and one count of self-administration of a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine, contrary to the provisions of s 12(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
      
       
     3 In respect of the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a term of 3 years and 4 months commencing on 25 February 2001 and expiring on 24 June 2004. His Honour found special circumstances and set a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months commencing on 25 February 2001 and expiring on 24 October 2002. 
      
       
     4 In respect of the offence of demanding money with menaces, his Honour sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 25 February 2001 to be served concurrently with the other sentence. His Honour directed that the respondent be released on parole on 24 October 2002. A Notice of Appeal by the Director was signed on 17 December 2001 and served on the respondent 2 days later. 
      
       
     5 During the evening of 25 February 2001 the respondent and a friend, identified only as Nathan, boarded a train at Cabramatta and at or about 9.30 pm either the respondent or Nathan shook a passenger, Arjun Dhir, awake, sat next to him and demanded his money. He then showed Mr Dhir a clear syringe with a needle attached and said to him, ""otherwise you will get AIDS"". Mr Dhir said he had no money and showed the respondent his empty wallet. Nathan thereupon took Mr Dhir's mobile phone returning his SIM card to him. Either the respondent or Nathan told Mr Dhir, ""Don't do anything till we get off"" and they left the train at Strathfield station. Mr Dhir reported the matter to police describing the respondent, including a description of injuries to his assailant's forehead and blood marks on his head consistent with having been recently injured. These facts gave rise to the charge of robbery whilst armed. 
      
       
     6 The respondent and Nathan apparently caught another train from Strathfield to the city and after leaving it walked to George Street, Sydney, where at about 10.20 pm that evening they approached Rupert Jones and asked him for a dollar. When Mr Jones took his wallet from his pocket the respondent said to him, ""No, not change, give me notes"", and Mr Jones, fearing violence, handed a $10 note to Nathan. Both the respondent and Nathan then left. 
      
       
     7 Mr Jones reported the matter to police describing both the respondent and Nathan, and these are the facts which gave rise to the count of demand money with menaces. 
      
       
     8 The respondent and Nathan had been recorded walking in George Street on closed circuit video cameras. Their descriptions accorded with those given by Mr Jones. They then turned into Park Street, Sydney, where at about 10.45 pm in the southern portion of Hyde Park they approached an intended victim and, with the assistance of Nathan, the respondent put him in a headlock and attempted to pull him to the ground. The intended victim broke free and approached a passing police car. As a result the respondent was arrested but Nathan escaped and has not been arrested in relation to these matters. These facts gave rise to the charge of affray referred to in the Form 1. 
      
       
     9 Upon being interviewed by police the respondent gave an account of an attack made on him the previous night when he was the victim of an assault by a group of Aboriginals. This explained his injuries which were consistent with the description thereof been given to police by one of his victims, Mr Dhir. He also told police he was seeking to bash the group of Aboriginals and he had confronted the intended victim because he looked homosexual and he hated homosexuals, and that he had had the syringe in his possession since he administered amphetamine to himself at 6 pm that evening. These facts gave rise to the second matter on the Form 1. 
      
       
     10 The respondent has been in custody since his arrest on 25 February 2001.  
      
       
     11 The respondent was born on 8 February 1980 and so was aged 21 at the time of the offences and at the time of his sentencing. His natural father died before he was born and he was brought up by his mother and stepfather whom he described as a ""tough man"" and a workaholic who disapproved of the respondent's homosexuality and lifestyle. The respondent appeared to his Honour to have relatively little schooling, having left school when aged 14 years to enter the family business. His Honour found that the respondent's stepfather disapproved of the respondent's homosexuality and lifestyle and the respondent told his Honour he had fallen out with his family and did not know where they lived. 
      
       
     12 His Honour also found the respondent would upon release from prison have nowhere to live unless the Salvation Army or some other charitable body was prepared to give him assistance. The respondent began to use marijuana at about the age of 14 years and by the age of 17 years was dependent on marijuana, alcohol, heroin and painkillers after claiming to have been bashed by members of a football team who believed that he was homosexual. 
      
       
     13 Since entering custody at the time of his arrest, the respondent has been in strict protection because other prisoners regarded him as homosexual, as apparently he is, so that he was in danger of homosexual attack and because other prisoners believed, apparently incorrectly, he had given up to police either Nathan or Nathan's identity; and he was expected to remain in protected custody during the balance of his sentence. His Honour expressly found that the respondent was distressed, partly by the seriousness of his offences, and that he was genuinely contrite. 
      
       
     14 The respondent's prior record was not impressive. On 22 January 1999 he was charged with possession of a prohibited drug and on 5 February that year at the Campbelltown Local Court he was placed on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 18 months and to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. Six months later, on 29 July 1999, whilst still subject to the recognisance, he was charged with robbery in company and on 8 February 2000 at the Liverpool District Court he was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 18 months to date from 29 July 1999, with an additional term of 18 months with an order for his release on parole subject to supervision and to the requirement that he undertake counselling, treatment or programs as directed. On the same day he was also sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months' imprisonment for stealing a motor vehicle. He was released on parole on 28 January 2000 and these offences were committed within 4 weeks of such release. Apparently he had not become involved with any treatment or counselling for his drug problems in the meantime.  
      
       
     15 His Honour took as his starting point the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 relating to pleas of guilty to charges of armed robbery. His Honour regarded the present case as a worse case than Henry because at the time of the commission of the armed robbery the respondent was on parole for a similar offence; secondly, because he used a syringe which the courts regard as abhorrent because of the fear it is calculated to, and does in fact, instil in victims, and also the two matters on the Form 1. 
      
       
     16 Having regard to these matters he took as his starting point a term of 5 years or 60 months which is at the top of the guideline range indicated in Henry (see [165]). He then looked at a number of subjective features and, having regard to the circumstances that the sentence has been and will be served in strict protection, his Honour reduced the term of 60 months to one of 50 months, a reduction of almost 18 percent.  
      
       
     17 His Honour then noted the plea of guilty at a relatively early time and said that the plea showed more than its bare utilitarian value because the respondent had shown genuine remorse, and there was some prospect, ""albeit not a great one"" that he may have been acquitted. He therefore gave a 20 percent discount on the 50 months thereby reducing it to 40 months.  
      
       
     18 He found special circumstances because he felt there was a need for an extended period of supervision on release and imposed a sentence of 40 months, or 3 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of half, namely, 20 months or 1 year and 8 months, and quite properly backdated the sentence to the date the respondent was taken into custody on these matters. 
      
       
     19 In relation to the demand money with menaces, his Honour then sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months. 
      
       
     20 A number of submissions have been made on behalf of the appellant, but it is first convenient to deal with the submissions made on behalf of the respondent relating to the continued relevance of the guidelines laid down in Henry. Much attention was in particular directed to the recent decision of the High Court in Wong and Leung v The Queen [2000] HCA 64 and we were informed that a Bench of five judges has been arranged to consider the continued relevance of another guideline judgment, namely R v Jurisic (1998) 101 A Crim R 259; 45 NSWLR 209, on 15 April 2002 that is R v Lee. It was submitted that it would be unfair to the respondent to determine this matter prior to the proper resolution of this question, but on the other hand, it would also be unfair for this matter to be adjourned for that question to be determined given the respondent's interest in the final resolution of his sentencing. 
      
       
     21 Wong and Leung v The Queen was concerned with a matter of Federal jurisdiction. It involved in part a consideration of the provisions of s 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 which has no direct equivalent in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and in addition, although this seems to have had only limited relevance to the judgment of those who constituted the majority in Wong, the guidelines had been promulgated in relation to circumstances which were not directly relevant to the case before the Court. Accordingly, the applicability of Wong to sentencing guideline judgments relating to offences under State law is not clear and, in any event, regard should, in my view, be had to the provisions of the Criminal Legislation Amendment Act 2001 No. 117. That Act inserted a new s 37A in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 authorising this Court to give a guideline judgment on its own motion in any proceedings considered appropriate by the Court and s 41 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Any guideline judgment given by the Court of Criminal Appeal before the commencement of s 37A that would have been validly given had s 37A commenced before it was given has, and is taken always to have had, the same force and effect as it would have had if s 37A had commenced before it was given."" 
         
        
       
     22 Accordingly, in my view, this Court and sentencing judges should apply guideline judgments such as Henry unless this Court or the High Court determines otherwise. 
      
       
     23 The Crown submits in fixing a starting point of 5 years or 60 months the learned sentencing judge failed to take into account a number of aggravating features which were not involved in the guideline judgment set by Henry; namely, that at the time of the commission of the offences the respondent was on parole for a similar offence, that the offences were committed at night, that the offence of armed robbery was committed by the use of a syringe, that his Honour was also imposing a concurrent sentence for the separate offence of demand money with menaces committed later that evening and that he was taking into account the two matters set out on the Form 1. Although his Honour did refer specifically as aggravating features to the fact that the respondent was on parole, that the instrument used was a syringe and that he was taking into account the matters on the Form 1, in my opinion he failed to take sufficient account of them as aggravating features; and he seems to have completely overlooked in this regard the fact that he was also sentencing the respondent for a totally separate offence the same night and making that sentence concurrent. 
      
       
     24 When these factors were taken into account the starting point should, in my opinion, have been beyond the range set out at [165] in Henry and should have been in the range of about 6 years (see [169] and [170]), and in failing to have regard to those matters I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error. I have no problem with the reduction of approximately 18 percent on account of the need to serve the sentence on strict protection, which from a starting point of say 72 months would translate to approximately 60 months. However, his Honour then, purportedly relying on R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, allowed a further discount of 20 percent on account of the respondent's plea of guilty. In doing so, I am satisfied his Honour overlooked the fact that the guidelines in Henry already had built into them a plea of guilty, particularly where the significance of that plea is limited by a strong Crown case (Henry at [162(vii)]). 
      
       
     25 In Thomson at [160] the Chief Justice said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea."" 
         
        
       
     26 His Honour went on at [161]: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The Court was asked to clarify its earlier guideline judgments in light of any guideline it might propose in this respect. The standard case identified in each of  
         R v Jurisic  
         and 
          R v Henry 
          included a plea of guilty. … In each of (those cases) the Court was concerned with a guilty plea of limited value. The guidelines for the offences considered in those cases should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty, for purposes of the application of the guideline promulgated in these reasons."" 
         
        
       
     27 The High Court has now held that a plea of guilty should not be regarded as having a utilitarian value in saving the time and expense of a trial but as demonstrating the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice: R v Cameron [2002] HCA 6 at [13]. However, in the present case where the plea was entered at an early stage such refinement of the ratio for the discount for the plea, in my view, makes no difference.  
      
       
     28 This plea was entered when it was first reasonable to do so and it was, on his Honour's findings, accompanied by remorse. The respondent was therefore entitled to some additional discount on account of his plea, but in my opinion the allowance of a further discount in the order of 20 percent indicates that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that a discount for the plea of guilty was already built into the guidelines in Henry and in this regard his Honour fell into error. In my view, the appropriate further discount in the circumstances of this case was no more than 15 percent. When applied to a sentence of 60 months it would result in a head sentence of 51 months, which I would round out to 50 months or 4 years and 2 months. 
      
       
     29 His Honour found special circumstances and there is no argument about this. In light of that finding he fixed a non-parole period of half the head sentence and I would not depart from this, but in my view the head sentence of 3 years and 4 months was inadequate. However, having regard to the principles that govern Crown appeals and in view of the principles of double jeopardy, it is in my view not a case where I would be inclined to interfere with the sentence imposed. I would therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed.  
      
       
     30 HEYDON JA: I agree with the order proposed for the reasons proposed by Dunford J. 
      
       
     31 BUDDIN J: I also agree with the orders proposed.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 12 March last a jury convicted the prisoner of the murder of Lee Michael Petrie on 23 August 2000. The trial before me was a re-trial, the jury at an earlier trial being unable to agree upon a verdict. The prisoner is now to be sentenced for that offence consistent with the jury’s verdict and the facts upon which it was based. 
     
      
    2 The substantial issue before the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the prisoner who caused the death of the deceased. There was also an issue raised as to whether at the time of the stabbing the prisoner had the intention for murder but it is unsurprising that, once the jury were satisfied that the prisoner was the person responsible for the death, they would find him guilty of murder. The nature of the stab wound and the circumstances in which it was inflicted were eloquent of the fact that whoever stabbed the deceased did so with at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and the only basis upon which the jury might have found that the accused was guilty of manslaughter rather than murder was if, by reason of his intoxicated state, they were left in doubt as to whether he had formed that intent. 
     
      
    3 The facts, therefore, upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced are really no longer in dispute. The prisoner, who has suffered from a long history of alcohol abuse, was staying for a short time on a property near Candelo in the State’s southeast. On that property, at the relevant time, were living Brian Peebles and John Tait. The prisoner had met Peebles through a mutual friend and had been staying at the property for a week before the stabbing. He was intending to return shortly to his home in Tenterfield. Much of the time of the persons living on the property, and those who visited them, was spent drinking alcohol throughout the day and well into the evening. 
     
      
    4 The deceased, who was aged 41 years, lived in Tathra. He was between jobs at the time and often went to Bega shopping and, when he did so, spent some time at the Commercial Hotel. He there became acquainted with Peebles who also use to drink at the hotel whenever he was in town. They had known each other for about 3 months before the killing. At some stage they discussed whether the deceased was interested in buying a motor vehicle that Peebles had repaired and was on the property. The deceased travelled to the property once to inspect the vehicle but decided not to purchase it. However Peebles and the deceased remained friends, Peebles offering to do minor repairs to the vehicle bought by the deceased.  
     
      
    5 On 23 August 2000 Peebles, Tait and the prisoner travelled together into Bega with the wife of a neighbour. They went to the Commercial Hotel where they met the deceased and arranged for him to drive them back to the property for a barbeque and a few drinks. They purchased some food and beer and all returned to the property in the deceased’s motor vehicle. They spent the afternoon drinking together. 
     
      
    6 At about 9.30 in the evening Tait decided that he had consumed enough alcohol and retired to the caravan in which he lived on the property. Peebles, the accused and the deceased remained in the lounge room of the residence drinking beer. By this time the three of them were well affected. Peebles described the deceased as being very drunk and sleepy. At some stage in the evening the prisoner got up and went to the kitchen ostensibly to get another can of beer from the fridge. However, he picked up a filleting knife from the butcher’s block in the kitchen and returned to where the deceased was sitting. He then stabbed the deceased three times in the chest. The prisoner then returned to the kitchen and obtained a plastic shopping bag, which he placed over the head of the deceased. 
     
      
    7 There were two superficial wounds inflicted upon the deceased and a third penetrated the deceased’s sternum and entered his heart. During one of the strikes the blade of the knife broke and remained caught in the deceased’s clothing. The deceased had some cuts to his hands that were consistent with defence wounds. 
     
      
    8 The body of the deceased was placed in the back of the deceased’s vehicle, which was driven a distance of about 15 kilometres to a picnic area on what is known as Myrtle Mountain. The body was dumped out of the vehicle and left on the side of the road. No attempt had been made to hide or cover the body. The deceased’s vehicle was driven back to the property and parked outside the residence. There was some issue in the trial as to who had taken the body to Myrtle Mountain but I have no doubt that it was both the accused and Peebles. It does not matter for the purpose of sentencing the prisoner who did the driving or whose decision it was to take the body there and leave it, although the prisoner later told police that he wanted the body left where it would be found. 
     
      
    9 At about 11.30pm on the night of the stabbing the prisoner telephoned his mother, Ms Peters. He had been trying to contact a friend of his, Mr Valentine, who was his spiritual advisor and alcohol counsellor, but had been unable to have Mr Valentine answer his calls. The prisoner told his mother that he had committed the “cardinal sin” and, when she asked what he meant by this, he told her that he had killed a man by stabbing him three times. Ms Peters could hear another man in the background who was repeating what the prisoner was saying including that he had killed the man. This was Peebles. The prisoner at one stage told him to shut up and assured his mother that Peebles had not killed the man but he had. Ms Peters asked the prisoner why he killed him and the prisoner said, “He was a mongrel and deserved to die”. The prisoner also said, “he had money and was ruining everybody’s lives and he deserved to die”. Peebles was still repeating the prisoner’s words and again the prisoner told him to shut up and said to his mother, “Don’t take any notice of him that’s Brian, he’s only trying to save my bacon.” Shortly after this the prisoner terminated the call. 
     
      
    10 The prisoner spoke to his mother again the next morning and once more confirmed that it was he who had killed the deceased and not Peebles. He also told her that he intended to do nothing as they had got rid of the body and were going to wait to see what happened. After this call Ms Peters spoke to a friend who had been a police officer and he contacted Detective Winterflood in Bega. 
     
      
    11 Later that day Thursday, 24 August, a Telstra employee found the body on Myrtle Mountain and the police were notified. 
     
      
    12 Back at the property the prisoner and Peebles were cleaning up in the lounge room and getting rid of any evidence of the killing. A fire was lit near the premises and the prisoner threw on it the settee upon which the deceased had been sitting when he was stabbed. The prisoner also threw the deceased’s wallet on the fire after he had gone through it. Mr Tait gave evidence that the prisoner was in possession of the deceased's watch and asked him whether he wanted his old watch. Tait declined the offer. Peebles told Tait that the deceased had been stabbed after an argument and his body had been dumped. The prisoner threatened Tait that he should not say anything or attempt to leave the property. Tait then withdrew to his caravan. 
     
      
    13 That evening the prisoner rang Mr Valentine. He told him that he and another person had killed a man. He said that he had spoken to his mother and told her what he had done. He also said “the only thing that has upset me is the grief that I’ve caused mum and the guy’s relatives”. He indicated that, although others with him wished to bury the body, he wanted it to be found. 
     
      
    14 The next day the prisoner was arrested. He thereafter on three occasions admitted to police that he was responsible for the stabbing of the deceased, two of those occasions being during video-recorded interviews. At the scene of the killing the prisoner demonstrated to police how he had stabbed the deceased. However, the prisoner was never able to give an account of the events preceding the stabbing or surrounding the disposal of the body. In particular he never claimed to be acting in self-defence or to rely upon any conduct by the deceased that might have explained or in some way justified an attack upon him. 
     
      
    15 Three days after his arrest the prisoner requested to speak to police and on that occasion he first raised what was to be his defence in the trial; that is he had no memory of the stabbing and his admissions were based upon what he had been told by Peebles. The prisoner later indicated to police that in effect they should be looking at Peebles as the killer and not him. Notwithstanding these claims Peebles was eventually charged with being an accessory after the fact to the murder and made a statement in which he gave an eyewitness account of the stabbing by the prisoner. As a result of giving an undertaking to testify against the prisoner, Peebles received a suspended sentence. 
     
      
    16 The prisoner has never claimed that he did not stab the deceased. Rather the trial was fought on the basis that he had no memory of the night’s events and that the admissions made by him were not reliable because they were a result of what he had been told by Peebles. The jury by its verdict were clearly satisfied that the confessions were based upon an actual memory of the stabbing by the prisoner however faulty and deficient his recollection of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing might be. 
     
      
    17 An important part of the trial concerned the level of intoxication of the prisoner at the time of the stabbing. Professor Starmer estimated that the prisoner had a blood alcohol reading of between .25 and .3. I doubt the accuracy of that estimate. But it is undisputed that the prisoner was well intoxicated and that it was the effects of alcohol upon him that at least partly explained the commission of the offence. That explanation, however, does nothing to mitigate the seriousness of his criminal conduct because the prisoner has a long history of violence associated with his abuse of alcohol. 
     
      
    18 The prisoner is aged 40 years. He has a record that commences as a juvenile in 1977 for stealing. Since that time he has continually breached the criminal law by the commission of offences of violence, dishonesty and traffic matters. He has spent a very considerable part of his adult life since he was first imprisoned in 1980 in gaol either serving sentences or on remand. But he has also been given the opportunity to address his problems with alcohol and in 1985 he was placed upon a good behaviour bond with supervision and counselling. However, the prisoner has continually re-offended and I am told, and accept, that these offences were always related to his misuse of alcohol. There is no doubt that while under the influence of alcohol the prisoner can be aggressive and violent to others. 
     
      
    19 The most serious matter on his criminal record was a sentence for being in possession of a firearm with intent to murder in 1981. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment for that offence. I am not aware of the full facts or circumstances surrounding it but the nature of the offence, which contains an allegation that he intended to kill another human being, is of some impact in determining the appropriate sentence for the present matter. This is not to suggest that the prisoner is again to be re-sentenced for that matter or that in the particular circumstances of this case his record will increase the seriousness of what he did or the length of the sentence he should serve. But the prisoner’s conduct on the occasion of his killing of the deceased must be seen in the light of an extensive criminal history including the fact that once before under the influence of alcohol he has acted with an intention of killing another human being. 
     
      
    20 I am satisfied that in the present case he also acted with such an intent despite his level of intoxication. The most significant stab wound was one calculated to kill the deceased. Once the jury determined that he had the intention necessary for murder, it follows in my view from the nature of the wound and the circumstances of the killing that he intended to kill the deceased. What is not clear is why the prisoner formed that intention in relation to a person whom he did not know. Clearly something must have occurred between the deceased and the prisoner that so enraged him that he picked up a knife and stabbed the deceased in the chest. Mr Peebles, who generally cannot be regarded as a reliable witness, mentioned to Mr Tait the next day that there was an argument between the prisoner and the deceased. It seems from what the prisoner told his mother that the dispute involved money. However that may be, I find that the intention to kill was formed almost instantaneously when the prisoner saw the knife on the kitchen block and that intention was put into effect only seconds later when he stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
    21 I accept that shortly after the murder the prisoner realised the gravity of what he had done such that he sought to contact Mr Valentine to tell him and, being unable to reach him, then rang his mother. I also accept that at least the next day the prisoner was remorseful for what he had done. I do not believe that it went so far as remorse for taking the life of Mr Petrie. The prisoner took possession of the deceased’s wallet and watch which is hardly consistent with a concern for the deceased. But certainly in his conversation with Mr Valentine the prisoner was remorseful as tor the effects of his acts upon the deceased’s family. To the prisoner’s benefit he never in any of his conversations with police tried to diminish what he had done by claiming self-defence or attributing misconduct to the deceased justifying his attack upon him. Rather the prisoner simply explained his conduct as the result of the effect of alcohol. He was clearly disturbed that he could not remember the circumstances surrounding the killing or comprehend why he had stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
    22 So far as any offence of murder can be said to lack the seriousness of some other case of murder, the present offence is not within the most serious category being as it was unpremeditated and occurring as a result of the prisoner losing his temper while under the influence of alcohol. I am prepared to accept the prisoner’s version that he went to the kitchen initially to obtain another can of beer rather than to get a knife with which to attack the deceased. Still it was a senseless killing of a wholly innocent and defenceless man who at least would have died almost instantaneously without suffering. In realistic and frank submissions by the parties before me a sentence in the range of 16 to 20 years was discussed as being appropriate to meet the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    23 The prisoner pleaded not guilty and tested the prosecution’s case as he was entitled to do. However, apart from the plea he has never denied the offence. I accept that over the days after his arrest the prisoner started to have doubts as to whether he did have a memory of the stabbing or whether his belief that he had killed the deceased came from what he had been told by Peebles and that it was he who was actually responsible. I can understand how this occurred because there is little doubt that the prisoner does suffer from memory problems due to his consumption of alcohol and there was material at least suggestive of Peebles guilt. Although the prisoner cannot be given the benefit of a discount which would follow from a plea of guilty, he is not to be sentenced on the basis that he refuses to accept responsibility for what he did or has no remorse or compunction for his conduct. The sentence, therefore, can be reduced somewhat on that account notwithstanding the sentence is imposed after trial. 
     
      
    24 The prisoner’s long history of aggressive conduct while under the influence of alcohol is a matter of grave concern. Before the commission of this murder, he has not presented as a real danger to society but the fact that this is the second occasion where he has acted with the intention of killing another human being and has on this occasion put that intention into effect does raise questions of his potential dangerousness to members of the public while he is under the influence of alcohol. At the present time there is little real likelihood that he will be able to overcome his abuse of alcohol when he is eventually released from custody. It may well be the case that he is institutionalised as he says, in so far as he feels more comfortable in custody than when he is at liberty in the community. But that is not a matter of mitigation. Rather it indicates that there is little prospect of the prisoner being able to live in society without abusing alcohol and without indulging in more aggressive conduct which can threaten the safety and welfare of other persons. 
     
      
    25 Mr Haesler, who appears for the prisoner, accepts that there is every possibility that the prisoner will not be released at the end of his non-parole period. He concedes that there are no special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. On behalf of his client he asks the Court to impose the least severe sentence that can be imposed which is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence yet has regard to the fact that the prisoner may have to serve the total sentence either because he is not released to parole or because he may breach any parole order such will be his difficulty of living within the community after another very lengthy period in custody. Whether the prisoner will be released at the end of his non-parole period will depend on what, if anything, he has been able to achieve while in custody which suggests some prospect for his rehabilitation. At the present there seems to be little, if any, hope of reform given his age and his history. 
     
      
    26 This is not simply to write off the prisoner as lost. He does have some insight into his problem and a willingness to address it. I am not unsympathetic to the severity of the prisoner’s problems having been addicted to alcohol since his early teens and having spent the greater part of his adult life in gaol. I can well understand the feelings of inadequacy that confront him when he is released into the community. He has suffered depressive episodes and spent time in psychiatric institutions. He receives anti-depressant medication in custody. Clearly there are some very deep-seated problems at the root of his criminal behaviour. He has been receiving some psychological assistance in prison but so far to no avail so far as his being able to cope in society. The gaol sentence that he must now serve will simply make it more difficult for him. 
     
      
    27 It seems to me to be one of those comparatively rare cases where the non-parole period should be more than that which would flow from the application of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Despite Mr Haesler’s submissions to the contrary it seems to me that personal deterrence is an important factor in determining the sentence to be imposed and the appropriate non-parole period despite the prisoner’s addiction to alcohol. Although his criminal responsibility may to some extent be reduced by reason of the effects of alcohol on him, his alcohol addiction and his resultant propensity for violent behaviour raise real concerns as to his conduct on release. His prospects of rehabilitation in gaol are poor and will be little better when he is in the community. I do not doubt the prisoner is willing to reform, as evidenced by his contact with Mr Valentine, but he has been quite unable to achieve that aim. He knew before the killing that his drinking was becoming out of control and in his own words to the police he was “going off the rails”. 
     
      
    28 I have received in evidence a victim impact statement by way of the report of a psychologist as to the effects of the death of Mr Petrie upon his parents, and in particular his mother. That report was not admitted for the purpose of increasing the sentence of the prisoner and has not been used by me in any way to aggravate the severity of his crime. But the reception of such evidence permits the family of the deceased to participate in the proceedings by expressing their grief and loss as a result of his death. It reminds the Court, if it is necessary to do so, of the real human tragedy involved in matters that come before it. I understand that it is particularly difficult to come to grips with the death of a treasured family member when it occurs so pointlessly and unexpectedly. The Court expresses it sympathy and understanding to Mr Petrie’s family. 
     
      
    29 The head sentence that I am about to impose is in my view at the lower end of the range, and in the light of the prisoner’s criminal record it may be thought to be unduly lenient. But the prisoner’s record does not completely disentitle him to leniency nor does the fact that he pleaded not guilty mean that I cannot reduce the sentence to give him some credit for his confessions and his statements of contrition and remorse. Without the confessions the prisoner would not have been convicted. As I have indicated there is a real likelihood that the prisoner will spend the whole sentence in custody and, therefore, actually serve longer in prison than many other persons who have committed similar offences. 
     
      
    30 However, this is not a case where he should be deprived of any opportunity to earn parole if he can. But the non-parole period is the least which in my view can reflect all the necessary elements of punishment and is appropriate to the seriousness of the offence he committed. It also reflects my view of his very limited prospects of rehabilitation either while in custody or if released to parole and so might be thought to have an element of preventative detention that is justified by the criminality of the offence he committed. The length of the parole period is in my view sufficient, if he can earn parole, to provide him with a structured program to re-enter society with support and guidance. He will either succeed in that period or not, and no longer period of parole supervision is in my view either required or justified. 
     
      
    31 A question arises as to when the prisoner’s sentence should commence. He was serving a period of custody in relation to traffic offences totalling 12 months from 25 August 2000, that is from the date of his arrest for the murder. The most serious of those offences is high range PCA and the prisoner has a history for such matters well justifying the sentence imposed upon him. The offences are unrelated to the murder and the prisoner was on bail for them at the time of the killing. I think it is appropriate that the murder sentence commence six months after his arrest. 
     
      
    32 The prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years with a non-parole period of 15 years. The sentence is to commence on 25 February 2001 and the non-parole period will expire on 24 February 2016 the date upon which the prisoner is eligible to be released to parole.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Steven McSmith against his conviction before her Honour Judge Morgan and a jury and an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him on three counts of assault with an act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900 for which he was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 18 months periodic detention with a non-parole period of 12 months. 
      
       
     2 He was acquitted by direction of a fourth count in similar terms. The three counts on which he was convicted concerned improper touching of the private parts of the body of the nine year old daughter of his de facto wife. The other count related to an allegation that the appellant caused her to touch his penis. For present purposes, it is not necessary to go into the facts in any further detail at this stage. 
      
       
     3 A number of grounds of appeal are relied upon. The first three are as follows: 
      
       
       1) Her Honour erred in allowing the Crown to amend counts 2 and 4. 
        
       2) Her Honour erred by directing the jury as to the evidence which constituted counts 2 and 4. 
        
       3) Her Honour erred by failing to direct the jury to acquit in relation to count 2. 
        
       
     4 These grounds are all related to the fact that the sequence of the complainant's evidence relating to the various counts did not come out in the order which had been particularised, and apparently not in the order contained in her statements. Accordingly, her Honour, the learned trial judge, permitted the Crown to amend the dates in three of the counts in the indictment and permitted the Crown to rely on evidence particularised as relating to count 4 as evidence relating to count 2, and vice versa. Ultimately her Honour directed a verdict of acquittal on count 4 and it is submitted that she should have directed a verdict of acquittal on count 2. In view of consideration of one of the other grounds, it is not necessary to consider these grounds any further except as to the ultimate disposal of the appeal, and I will come to this aspect later in this judgment. 
      
       
     5 Ground 4 was that the trial miscarried because the appellant was unable to cross-examine the complainant about the content of reports tendered in Family Court proceedings following a ruling by her Honour that s 121 of the Family Law Act 1975 operated so as to prohibit such cross-examination. I shall return to this ground later. 
      
       
     6 Ground 5 was as follows: 
      
       
       Her Honour erred by admitting evidence of uncharged sexual assaults committed upon the complainant as evidence of the relationship between the complainant and the appellant. 
        
       
     7 After giving evidence of three indecent assaults, the complainant gave evidence about a number of other incidents which did not relate to any of the counts in the indictment. She talked of ""a fourth occasion"" and said that there were other occasions when similar acts occurred. There were no further details given about these other uncharged acts. There was no evidence about how many times they occurred or about where or when they occurred. There was no evidence about whether or not anyone else was present on such occasions, and no surrounding details or descriptions were given, although it did appear from the brief details that she gave that they were concurrent with, or closely concurrent to, the occasions of which she had given evidence and which ultimately became the subject of the first three counts in the indictment.  
      
       
     8 The evidence apparently took the parties by surprise and arose because the Crown was attempting to lead the complainant to a further incident which had been particularised where the complainant claimed the appellant caused her to touch his penis, and the Crown was endeavouring to do this without asking leading questions. 
      
       
     9 The appellant's counsel objected immediately following the receipt of the evidence. An extensive argument was had in the absence of the jury about the relevance of the evidence and the consequences of it having been admitted. The Crown was then allowed to continue its examination-in-chief of the complainant and evidence of the penis-touching incident was received. 
      
       
     10 At the conclusion of evidence-in-chief, counsel for the appellant sought an adjournment to the following day and on resumption that day, counsel for the appellant sought a discharge of the jury which was refused, and the evidence was admitted as relationship evidence: see R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, R v AH (1997) 98 A Crim R 71 at 77-8. Appropriate directions in relation to that evidence were given in the summing-up where her Honour said that it was admitted solely for placing the evidence of the facts in context; that the jury must not use it as showing tendency for committing such offences, and must not substitute evidence of those other acts for the evidence of the specific acts charged. Whether the evidence was appropriate to be admitted as relationship evidence, has not been debated before us. The evidence may or may not have been admissible in that regard, but in so far as it was admissible for that purpose, the directions in the summing-up were appropriate and unobjectionable. 
      
       
     11 However, the Crown has conceded that once this evidence had been unexpectedly introduced by the complainant, the application for the discharge of the jury should have been granted. I am by no means satisfied that this concession was properly made. Young witnesses in sexual assault cases will from time to time unexpectedly give evidence of other instances of sexual misconduct and not every such occasion will justify the discharge of the jury. Moreover, such evidence may, though unexpected - and it may from time to time arise in cross-examination - be admissible as relationship evidence, although I prefer to describe it as “background” evidence, or as her Honour did in the summing-up, as “context” evidence so as to clearly distinguish it from tendency evidence. 
      
       
     12 Were it not for the Crown's concession, I would need to hear further submissions before upholding this ground of appeal, but in view of such concession, I consider it appropriate to uphold the appeal on this ground, and there it becomes necessary to order a new trial. 
      
       
     13 Harking back to grounds 1, 2 and 3, Mr Boulten, on behalf of the appellant, has submitted that the new trial should be limited to grounds 1 and 3 and a verdict of acquittal should be entered on ground 4. What happened at the trial was that that there were four counts in identical terms. Particulars had been given of the allegations to be made in respect of each count. When the complainant gave her evidence she placed the events in a different time sequence to that which had been particularised, and in particular gave evidence of the penis-touching incident as being the last of the matters. Accordingly her Honour allowed the date in three of the counts to be amended and directed that the penis-touching incident allegation related to the fourth count and the further touching incident be related to the second count. 
      
       
     14 Ultimately because the facts relating to the penis-touching incident did not satisfy the essential ingredients of a charge under s 61M, her Honour directed a verdict of acquittal on the fourth count. Mr Boulten has submitted that permitting the Crown to substitute the particulars for a different count was an error of law and that the verdict of acquittal should have been on the second count, and that therefore the accused should have the benefit of the verdict of not guilty which he already has on the fourth count, and that this Court should direct a verdict of acquittal on the second count. 
      
       
     15 There was no error of law on her Honour's part in permitting the Crown to treat the matter the way it did. Apart from the change in date - and the dates were not material to the ingredients of any of the offences - the counts were all in the same form, and after her Honour permitted the switching of the particulars, the counts still remained in the same form as before. What occurred, in my view, amounted to no more than an amendment of the particulars. There was no amendment to any count and the appellant was not prejudiced in any way. The ruling was given quite early in the trial and the appellant knew which counts he was answering in relation to which set of particulars. For these reasons, I am satisfied that there should be a new trial on counts 1, 2 and 3. 
      
       
     16 I return now to ground 4 relating to whether defence counsel should have been permitted to cross-examine the complainant about the content of reports tendered in the Family Court proceedings, and in respect of this I note that her Honour, the trial judge, gave a certificate pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. With an order for a new trial, the issue, in one sense, becomes academic but is likely to arise again in the new trial, and it therefore appears desirable to say something about it. 
      
       
     17 We were referred to the provisions of s 121(9) of the Family Law Act 1975 and cases decided under that subsection. However, it appears from the limited material available to us that the material on which defence counsel sought to cross-examine may have been notes of conferences held pursuant to s 62F of that Act, in which case the provisions of ss (8) of that section would need to be considered, or alternatively s 19N may be relevant. Having drawn the parties' attention to these provisions, I consider this Court should not give a final ruling on the issue which is now immaterial to the disposal of this appeal. 
      
       
     18 There was another ground of appeal relating to the failure of appellant's counsel to lead evidence relating to proof that the appellant was a person of good character in a particular respect, namely that he did not engage in inappropriate sexual activity with children, but in view of what I have said, it is not necessary to consider this ground further. 
      
       
     19 I accordingly propose that the appeal be upheld, the convictions and sentences quashed, and I would order a new trial on each of counts 1, 2 and 3. 
      
       
     20 HEYDON JA: I agree

        REGINA v ROY CARRION 
        
        
       On 26 May 2000, the court delivered judgement in relation to a Crown appeal against sentence, in which it was announced that the appeal was allowed, the periodic detention sentence below was quashed, and that the respondent was sentenced to 3 years full time imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years and three months. On the day upon which the judgement was handed down, the respondent was not present and in his absence, a warrant for his apprehension was issued. This warrant was executed some 14 months later and the respondent was returned to custody. In the meantime, the orders that the court had announced were not perfected so that the District Court was not notified of them and the indictment was not endorsed. When the matter came back before the court, the Crown asked it to amend the date of commencement of the sentence to the date on which the respondent was returned to custody. The Crown asserted that the court has the power to perfect the clear intention that it earlier expressed, and this should be achieved by varying the commencement date. The crown submitted that this power has been exercised in the past (for example  
       R v Ponfield  
       [1999] NSWCCA 442) 
       , that this power arises by reason of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to amend orders to accord with its intention, as expressed in the  
       Slip Rule 
       , and that the power additionally arose in this case as the judgement had not been perfected. 
       
      
      
       
       Held: 
        (amending the date for commencement): 
       
      
      
       
       Exercise of the power in the past 
        
       Although the Court had varied its order in  
       Ponfield 
       , this was done by consent, and thus the question of power had not been considered. 
       
      
      
       
       Source of the courts power 
        
        The Court has an implied or inherent power to vary an order so as to give effect to the Court’s true intention. It is not necessary to answer the question of whether or not the  
       Slip Rule 
        applies in criminal cases.

       Whether the judgement had been perfected 
        
       The order pronounced on 26 May 2000 was provisional, and was intended to come into effect only when the warrant was executed. Further, the formalities required for a sentencing order to pass in to record are found in r51, 52 and 53 of the Criminal Appeals Rules (NSW): It is the duty of the proper officer of the district court upon receipt from the registrar of the Court of Appeal of notification of the orders made to formally enter the particulars. For the District Court, the record of the proceedings is the indictment itself. The steps required to place the order on the record in this case had not been taken, and the Court had power to reopen the matter.

       Whether the respondent can claim, as a matter of law, to have been serving a sentence between May 2000 and July 2001 
        
       The respondent, as a matter of law was not taken to have been serving the substituted sentence or the original order for periodic detention even though he was not in custody. The original order for periodic detention remained on foot. Sections 82 and 89 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentence) Act 1999 however meant that the term of the sentence had been extended during the period when the respondent had been at large and had not been reporting for periodic detention.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 THE COURT: On 12 May 2000, this Court heard an appeal by the Crown against the leniency of a sentence of periodic detention for 3 years, to date from 2 October 1999, which was imposed upon the Respondent by his Honour Judge Woods QC, in the Sydney District Court. 
      
       
     2 By its judgment dated 26 May 2000, the Court decided that the Crown appeal should be allowed, that the sentences imposed in the Court below should be quashed, and that in lieu thereof the Respondent should be sentenced on each of the 2 counts in question, to 3 years full time imprisonment, to commence on 23 May 2000, and to be served concurrently. It also decided that a non parole period of 2 years and 3 months to commence also on 23 May 2000 should be set, as a consequence of which the Respondent would be released to parole on 22 August 2002. 
      
       
     3 On the day upon which Grove J handed down the judgment of the Court, the Respondent was not present, as was permissible under s 14A of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In his absence however, his Honour directed that a warrant for his apprehension be issued. 
      
       
     4 That warrant was expressed as a “Bench warrant to apprehend a Respondent who has failed to appear before the Court of Criminal Appeal”. It was executed on 18 July 2001, as a result of which the Respondent was returned into custody.  
      
       
     5 On 4 October 2000 the Parole Board revoked the periodic detention order made by his Honour Judge Woods. However it rescinded the revocation order on 15 August 2001 when the circumstances of the Crown appeal came to its notice. 
      
       
     6 The matter next came before this Court on 6 August 2001, when an issue was raised as to whether it had power to re-open the matter and to amend the date for the commencement of the substituted sentences to the date on which the Respondent had been returned into custody. Several further submissions have been provided, including submissions dealing with an additional point which was raised by the Court, as presently constituted, during the hearing which was refixed for 4 February 2002. 
      
       
     7 In its submissions, the Crown has asserted that the Court does have the power to perfect the clear intention which it had earlier expressed, namely that the Respondent serve a term of 2 years and 3 months in full time custody, and that he thereafter be released to parole for the balance of the proposed term of 3 years. This, it submits, should be achieved by varying the commencement date of the new sentences to 15 July 2001 (preserving the backdate of 3 days previously allowed). 
      
       
     8 This power it submitted: 
      
       
        
       (a) has been exercised in the past: for example  
       R v Ponfield 
        [1999] NSWCCA 422; 
        
        
       (b) arises by reason of the inherent jurisdiction which the Court has to amend orders or judgments to accord with its intention, as expressed in the “ 
       slip rule” 
       , and so as to ensure that the Respondent does not receive an unjustified windfall by reason of the fact that he failed to appear on the day appointed for delivery of the judgment, and was not arrested until a date 14 months or so later; and  
        
        
       (c) arose, in this case, additionally by reason of the fact that the judgment of 26 May 2000 has not been perfected, there being evidence before the Court that no steps have been taken since that date, pursuant to the  
       Criminal Appeal Rules 
       , to notify the Court of trial, of its determination (Rule 51), with the consequence that no relevant entry has been made on the indictment, or on the District Court file or its computer records relating to the proceedings (Rule 53). 
        
       
     9 In reply, the Respondent has submitted that the Court has no such power to amend its order, with the consequence that the new sentences must be taken to have been running, and to have been served, albeit the Respondent was at large, during the period from 23 May 2000 to 18 July 2001. If this proposition is correct, then the Respondent would be released to parole on 22 August 2002, having served only 13 months of the intended non parole period of 27 months. 
      
       
     10 In support of that proposition, the Respondent submits that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the judgment, in its terms took effect on the day on which it was handed down; and that 
        
        
       (b) the  
       slip rule 
        does not apply to criminal proceedings.  
        
       
     11 In this regard reliance was placed on s 48 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which requires the Court to specify the date on which a sentence commences; and on s 47 of the Act which states, subject to s 70 (periodic detention), and subject to an order made under sub section (2) fixing some other date, that a sentence of imprisonment commences “on the day on which sentence was imposed”. 
      
       
     12 The direction of Grove J, made on 26 May 2000, that “the Respondent should be taken into custody to serve the sentence now imposed”, it was submitted, meant that the substituted sentence should be taken to have commenced from that day. Additionally, it was pointed out that s 47(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act permits the Court to direct that a sentence commence after the date on which it is imposed, only where it is imposed wholly or partially by way of accumulation upon any other sentence of imprisonment.  
      
       
     13 It is true that in Ponfield the Court varied its order, so as to alter the commencement date of the term of imprisonment imposed, thereby reflecting the circumstance that the Respondent had not turned himself in after the Court had made its order, and was only taken into custody when arrested on other charges. It was similarly a Crown appeal against leniency. However it appears that this was done by consent, and as a consequence the question of power was not in issue. 
      
       
     14 There have been a number of decisions in which consideration has been given to the question whether the Court has, in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction, the ability to correct orders so as to reflect its intention, either under the slip rule or by virtue of some inherent power, or otherwise. 
      
       
     15 In Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 319, Gummow J made reference to the possibility that a notification of the determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal, of an application for leave to appeal against a sentence, which had incorrectly recorded the orders which had been made, could be corrected under the slip rule. Although the Respondent submitted that his Honour had in mind the High Court Rules, clearly the Court would have had no power, under its slip rule, to correct orders or notifications made by the Supreme Court. His Honour could only have had in consideration the possibility of correction being effected by the latter court.  
      
       
     16 In Regina v Allen [1994] 1 Qd R 526, the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal, by a majority, held that it had inherent jurisdiction to vary the order which it had originally made, so as to allow the appellant to argue a ground of appeal based upon a recent decision of the High Court (Robinson v The Queen (No 2) (1991) 65 ALJR 644) which had not been considered during the trial or appeal. 
      
       
     17 This was done, notwithstanding the fact that the order of the Court on appeal had been perfected, although its reasons had not been handed down. Dowsett J commented: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         whether the slip rule applies to proceedings on the criminal side in this Court or not does not matter. If it does not, then the inherent jurisdiction is available. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     18 That inherent jurisdiction was seen to lie in the fact that “the interests of justice required” the Court’s intervention, applying the decision in R v Daniel (1977) 1 QB 364. There, the English Court of Appeal had permitted an appeal to be reopened where, by reason of an administrative error, it has been heard without the participation of the legal representatives of the appellant. This was allowed even though its order had been perfected.  
      
       
     19 Earlier in Regina v De Zylva (1988) 38 A Crim R 207, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal corrected an internal inconsistency in an order which it had handed down following its determination of a sentence appeal. The court said (at 208): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It has been held on many occasions that a court may recall an order before it has passed into record: see Billington [1980] VR 625; State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd (1982) 150 CLR 29. We have accordingly inquired of the appropriate court officers and have been informed that the judgment of the court has passed into record in that it has been entered in the records of the trial court in accordance with r 35(b) of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1956. 
         
        
        
         
         We should not therefore recall the order which we pronounced or vacate it. But any court has an inherent jurisdiction to correct any judgment or order which owing to error does not give effect to what the court intended to do. It is a power which is essential to ensure that justice is done. It is not possible pursuant to the power to vary an order which the court intended to make but an error in an order can be corrected so as to do justice and to give effect to the court’s intention. 
         
        
        
         
         This case is a clear case for the exercise of the power. The operative part of the order does not give effect to the court’s intention and the failure was due to error. 
         
        
        
         
         Since we cannot recall the order which has passed into record, the appropriate course is for us to make a supplemental order. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     20 The slip rule, which is formalised in an express rule of the Supreme Court of New South Wales applicable to its civil jurisdiction (Supreme Court Rules Part 20 r 10), has been said to reflect an inherent jurisdiction of a Court to correct, at any time, a clerical mistake, or an error arising from an accidental slip or omission in a minute of a judgment or order. 
      
       
     21 In L. Shaddock & Associates Pty Limited v Parramatta City Council (1982) 151 CLR 590 the High Court considered a situation in which, following its allowance of an appeal, and the perfecting of the orders made, it was discovered that, through inadvertence, the Court had not been asked to make an order for the payment of interest which had accrued from the date of the original judgment until the date of the decision of the High Court. 
      
       
     22 It was held, notwithstanding the fact that the issue had not been raised before them, and notwithstanding the fact that orders had been perfected, the slip rule permitted the Court to go behind the order and deal with the outstanding question. It was said (at 594) by the Court, in this respect:  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Order 29, r.11 is in the traditional form of a slip rule. It reflects the inherent jurisdiction of a court ‘at any time to correct an error in a decree or order arising from a slip or accidental omission’ (see Milson v Carter). In terms, the rule provides, inter alia, that ‘an error arising in a judgment or order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court or a Justice on motion or summons’. The rule extends to authorise an omission resulting from the inadvertence of a party’s legal representative (see Fritz v Hobson; Chessum & Sons v Gordon; In re Inchape (Earl); Coppins v Helmers & Brambles Constructions Pty Ltd; Tak Ming Co Ltd v Yee Sang Metal Supplies Co. This is so, regardless of whether the order has been drawn up, passed and entered (see Milson v Carter; Fritz v Hobson).

     23 In Regina v Cripps  [1984] 1 QB 686, the Court of Appeal observed (at 695): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It is well settled that any judge is fully entitled to reconsider and vary any decision at any time before the order embodying or based upon that decision has been perfected (In re Suffield and Watts, Ex parte Brown (1888) 20 QBD 693, 697, per Fry LJ), although in some circumstances he may be under an obligation to give the parties a further opportunity to be heard. At that stage no slip rule power is needed. However, once the order has been perfected, the trial judge is functus officio and, in his capacity as the trial judge, has no further power to reconsider or vary his decision whether under the authority of the slip rule or otherwise. The slip rule power is not a power granted to the trial judge as such. It is one of the powers of the court, exercisable by a judge of the court who may or may not be the judge who was in fact the trial judge 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         In the case of the High Court, the slip rule power is contained in RSC, Ord 20, r 11: 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         It is surprisingly wide in its scope. Its primary purpose is akin to rectification, namely to allow the court to amend a formal order which by accident or error does not reflect the actual decision of the judge: Preston Banking Co v William Allsup & Sons [1895] 1 Ch 1414. But it also authorises the court to make an order which it failed to make as a result of the accidental omission of counsel to ask for it: In re Earl of Inchcape [1942] Ch 394, approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Tak Ming Co v Yee Sang Metal Supplies Co [1973] 1 WLR 300, 304. It even authorises the court to vary an order which accurately reflects the oral decision of the court, if it is clear that the court inadvertently failed to express the decision which it intended: Adam & Harvey Ltd v International Maritime Supplies Co Ltd [1967] 1 WLR 445. However, it cannot be over-emphasised that the slip rule power can never entitle the trial judge or a court to reconsider a final and regular decision once it has been perfected, even if it has been obtained by fraud: per Lord Halsbury in Preston Banking Co v William Allsup & Sons [1895] 1 Ch 141, 143. We say ‘final’ decision, because different considerations apply in the case of orders which are provisional because, for example, they were obtained ex parte and we say ‘regular’ because again different considerations arise where the order may be said to be irregular for any of a variety of reasons.” 
          
         
        
       
     24 The Respondent places particular reliance upon the decision by the Full Federal Court in Jovanovic v The Queen  (1999) 106 A Crim R 548 in contending that there was no jurisdiction under either the slip rule, or the inherent power of the Court, to now vary the sentencing order. Jovanovic was a case where the sentencing judge initially imposed a sentence, in relation to the first count in an indictment containing 14 counts, which exceeded the maximum sentence available for the offence to which it applied. The overall sentence imposed, by reason of an accumulation of the sentence for count 3, was one of imprisonment for 9 years, with a non parole period of 6 years. After an appeal was lodged, the Sentencing Judge discovered the error, and then purported to vary the sentencing order by revoking the sentences for counts 1 and 3, by resentencing in respect of them, by directing that the new sentence for count 3 be cumulative upon that for count 1, and by directing that the sentence for count 6, which had previously been directed to be served concurrently, now be served cumulatively upon that for count 3. The net result was the same as that previously imposed, namely a head sentence of 9 years with a non parole period of 6 years. No reference was made to the slip rule (O 32 r 14) although his Honour did say: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The slip having occurred, it is appropriate to resentence the accused on all counts 
         .” 
         
        
       
     25 It was held on appeal that the sentencing judge had no jurisdiction to revoke any of the sentences, or to impose a substitute sentence, because the sentence first imposed had passed into the Court record, that is, it had been perfected in accordance with the law and practice of the Australian Capital Territory.  
      
       
     26 The Court (Wilcox, Miles and Weinberg JJ) noted (at p 551): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         As a general rule, except by way of appeal, a court has no power to review, alter, vary or set aside any judgment or order one it is finally recorded.” 
         
        
        
       They went on to say (at 552): 
        
        
         
         “ 
         In civil cases, before a judgment or order has passed into record, the judge who gave the judgment or made the order may reconsider the decision and withdraw, alter, or vary it: Carroll v Price [1960] VR 651 at 657. After a judgment or order has been formally entered in the records of the court or, to use the language which is sometimes invoked, ‘authenticated’, the judge is said to be functus officio. 
         
        
        
         
         This general rule does not apply to an order made ex parte, which may be set aside or varied on the application of any party affected by it. 
         
        
        
         
         Superior courts of record are said to have an inherent (or implied) jurisdiction to amend or vary a judgment or order even after it has been authenticated, or drawn up, passed, and entered, so that it states correctly what the court decided and intended: Re Swire (1885) 30 Ch D 239 at 243 per Cotton LJ; Bailey v Marinoff at 539 per Gibbs J; L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (No 2) (1982) 151 CLR 590 at 594 per Mason ACJ, Wilson and Deane JJ. This inherent (or implied) jurisdiction is generally 
          reflected in rules of court. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     27 Reference was made to the passage in Cripps; Ex parte Muldoon above noted, after which their Honours made the observation upon which the Respondent has seized: 
      
       
        
         
         “ ‘Slip-rule’ powers of this type contained in rules of court generally have no application to criminal proceedings. 
         ” (See also a similar observation at p 560). 
         
        
       
     28 They then went on to consider whether a superior Court of record has, or does not have, an inherent power when it exercises criminal jurisdiction to vary or amend a conviction after the verdict of the jury has been accepted, and if so, whether it extends to varying or amending a sentence which has been imposed. After a review of some of the authorities in England and elsewhere their Honours said (at 554): 
      
       
        
         
         “In Australia, the approach which has been taken at common law seems to be more complicated. The general rule is that a sentencing judge may correct a sentence before it has ‘passed into record’. The difficulty is that there is no clearly defined or obvious point at which that may be said to have occurred. As a general rule, orders are not drawn up, entered, or taken out, in criminal cases.” 
         
        
       
     29 Their Honours made reference to the practice in Victoria and in the Australian Capital Territory concerning the administrative steps following the reception of a verdict or plea of guilty and the passing of sentence, before observing (at 557): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In our opinion it is likely that in Victoria at least,.. the common law position is that a sentence is regarded as having ‘passed into record’ when it is recorded on the back of the presentment, and possibly in the relevant court document described as the triplicate as well. Certainly when both of these events have occurred, the sentencing judge is functus officio, save perhaps for a genuine application of the ‘slip-rule’ in the exercise of the court’s inherent (or implied) jurisdiction.  
         
        
        
         
         In New South Wales the common law seems to be viewed in the same way 
         .” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     30 Their Honours next gave consideration to way in which the matter had been dealt with by statute, noting the existence of an express power both in Victoria (s 104A of the Sentencing Act 1991) and in New South Wales (s 24 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 – now replaced by s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) to reopen proceedings where the Court has imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or has failed to impose a penalty, that is required by law. Their existence, it was accepted (at 558): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         … does not derogate from the existing common law power to correct sentencing slips – see De Zylva (1988) 38 A Crim R 207; Saxon [1998] 1 VR 503, or from statutory rights of appeal or review in respect of sentence. However, neither the common law, nor the statutory power to correct a sentencing slip or clerical error, permits a sentencer to vary an order actually intended to be made simply because the sentencing judge has changed his or her mind.” 
          
         
        
       
     31 In the particular circumstances of that case it was held that the recording of the sentences on the “yellow sheets” used for that purpose in the ACT, followed by the issue of a warrant for the removal of the applicant to the Goulburn Correctional Centre meant that they had passed into record.  
      
       
     32 While it is true that their Honours expressed the view that the “slip rule” did not apply to criminal cases, they did not question the existence of the implied or inherent power to vary an order which did not reflect the words spoken or the intent of the sentencing judge, so as to give effect to the Court’s true intention (see pages 560-561), or the power to intervene when the sentencing order has not been perfected. 
      
       
     33 Properly considered, the decision does not make good the point for which the Respondent contends, namely that the Court has no power to vary the order announced by Grove J on 26 May 2001 by substituting for the commencement date of 23 May 2000, the date 15 July 2001. The better view, on the authorities reviewed, is that it did have an inherent power to do so, whether or not the order had been perfected. 
      
       
     34 It is not however necessary to finally decided that question, since the case is one where the orders proposed and announced on 26 May 2001 have not been perfected. In that regard, leaving aside the formalities required for a sentencing order to pass into record, I am additionally of the view that Grove J intended the order pronounced to be provisional and to come into effect only when the warrant, which he directed should issue, was executed.  
      
       
     35 That the Court has power to amend or vary an order which has not been perfected, and even to reopen an appeal in those circumstances, is well established upon the authorities mentioned so far, as well as by the decisions of this Court in Regina v Lapa (No. 2) (1995) 80 A Crim R 398, Regina v Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71, and Regina v Reid [1996] NSWCCA 21. See also the observations of Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 300, of McHugh J at 315 and of Gummow J at 327 in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
      
       
     36 In Regina v Lapa (No. 2), application was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal to reopen an appeal against conviction, which had earlier been dismissed, in order that the Court might deal with one of the original grounds of appeal that had not been considered by it. At the time of the application, the order of the Court dismissing the appeal had not been perfected, although that was attended to subsequently. At the reconvened hearing, the ground of appeal which had not been dealt with, was considered upon its merits, but was found not to have been made good. 
      
       
     37 In the course of his reasons concerning whether or not the appeal should be reopened, Clarke JA, with whom Handley JA and Sully J agreed, said (at 402): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         It is well established at common law that a court may review, correct or alter its judgment at any time until its order or judgment has been perfected: Smith v NSW Bar Association (No 2) (1992) 176 CLR 256 at 265; Re Suffield & Watts; Ex parte Brown [1888] 20 QBD 693 at 697; Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1940)63 CLR 382 at 457; Pittalis v Sherefettin [1986] QB 868 at 879; Re Harrison’s Share [1955] Ch 260. 
         
        
        
         
         The position is different once the judgment or order has been perfected. Subject to the rules of court and possible exceptions concerning subsidiary matters, a court has no power to reconsider its decision and the judgment can be reviewed only on appeal: Bailey v Marinoff (1971) 125 CLR 529. Since Bailey there have been a number of decisions in the High Court bearing on the question of the court’s power to review its own decision and the circumstances in which it may alter an order made but none of those cases has overruled Bailey or the common law rule that once the judgment has been perfected a court has no power, subject to any relevant rules, to alter its judgment in a substantial respect.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour continued (at 403): 
        
        
         
         “In the present case it is common ground that the order had not been perfected when the application for reconsideration was filed. Nor had it been perfected at the time that the court heard argument on the application. In accordance with the old authority the court had undoubted jurisdiction to entertain the application and to accede to it. The action which was taken after the Crown had spoken to the Registrar of the District court may, however, have perfected the order. There was no argument on this point but I will assume, against the appellant, that it did so. 
         
        
        
         
         The manner of perfection of the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal (ie by the Registrar of the District Court noting it on the indictment) when coupled with the fact that there is no question that the perfected order will affect the rights of third parties or settle questions of status does lead me to question whether the interests of justice are furthered by the maintenance of the rigid distinction drawn by the common law rule as evidenced in authorities such as Bailey in a case such as the present. I do not doubt that the principle of finality is of first importance. What I do question is whether it should operate so as to close off automatically any reconsideration of a judgment after it has been perfected, at least where questions of status and the rights of third parties are not concerned. To take the instant case as an example – Why should the rights of the parties be so dramatically affected by the administrative actions of a court officer? 
         
        
        
         
         Where an application for consideration of a judgment is made before the judgment is perfected a court accords great weight to the principle of finality and, primarily for this reason, it is only in rare cases that it does accede to the application. A similar approach in cases where a judgment has been perfected would, in my opinion, more readily meet broad considerations of justice than the present rule does.  
         
        
        
         
         In each case the principle of finality would be of primary importance but the court would be able to exercise a judicial discretion having carried out a balancing exercise. Where questions of status or the rights of third parties are involved these stand as additional and important reasons why a court should not re-open its judgment once it had been perfected. 
         
        
        
         
         It is not, however, necessary to take that question further in these proceedings…” 
         
        
       
     38 In the particular circumstances of that case where the order had not been perfected at the time of the application for reconsideration of the appeal, but had been subsequently perfected, his Honour said, (at 405): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         For my part there are two considerations which lead me to conclude that, accepting that the power of the court to vary a judgment cannot be enlivened, absent any relevant rule, after the judgment has been perfected it does have power to remedy an oversight where application is made before that has occurred, notwithstanding that the judgment is perfected while the court is considering the matter. The fundamental consideration which should determine whether a court of criminal appeal should reconsider its judgment is whether the failure to do so might lead to a miscarriage of justice. To put it another way, the application should be determined upon the interests of justice, giving full weight to the principle of finality. The second consideration is the basic practical one to which reference was made by the High Court in Jones and Pantorno. That is, that the Court of Criminal Appeal should deal with all grounds of appeal upon which argument was proffered before the case is sent to the High Court for consideration of a leave application. 
         
        
        
         
         In the present circumstances there can be no doubt that the overwhelming interests of justice favour the granting of the application. Indeed, both parties invited the court to embark upon a consideration of the outstanding point if it were open to the court to do so. 
         
        
        
         
         For these reasons I am not prepared to accept, in the state of authorities, that the administrative act of the Registrar of the District Court in affixing the order of this Court to the indictment after the court had embarked upon the consideration of an application to reopen was effective to remove a power which until that moment the court undoubtedly enjoyed. In my opinion the court should proceed to consider the outstanding point and to give an ultimate judgment reflecting its views on that point.” 
         
        
       
     39 Lapa (No 2) was considered by the court in Saxon, where following dismissal of an appeal against conviction, an application was made to the Court for it to entertain a further appeal based upon what was asserted to be fresh evidence which had recently come to light. In this instance, the order of the Court dismissing the appeal had been perfected before the further application was made. The Court held, applying Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431 that, in the circumstances of the case, it lacked jurisdiction to reopen the appeal. 
      
       
     40 In Regina v Stephens (1990) 48 A Crim R 323, Allen J said, in relation to the way in which orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal were perfected (at 327): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         In accordance with the requirements of those rules (r 51,52 and 53 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW)) it was the duty of the proper officer of the District Court upon receipt from the Registrar of the Court of Appeal of notification of the orders made on 19 December 1983 formally to enter the particulars. There are no other provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules for the recording of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. What, however, constitutes the record of the District Court in relation to trials upon indictment? By long practice the record is the indictment itself. It is upon the indictment that the orders are noted… Nevertheless, the rules recognise the practice of the noting of judicial orders on the indictment. The indictment is the ‘record’ of the proceedings: Billington [1980] VR 625; Cross [1973] QB 937; (1973) 57 Cr App R 660.” 
         
        
        
       I see no reason to adopt any different view, nor has any argument been developed to the contrary of these observations.  
        
       
     41 The evidence led in this case shows that the steps required to place the order on record, that is to perfect it, have not been taken. It is accordingly open for the Court to reconsider the matter, and subject to the consideration next mentioned, to vary the commencement date of the sentence so as to give effect to its intention.  
      
       
     42 Next, of relevance for the position which now arises, is the decision of the High Court in Whan v McConaghy (1984) 153 CLR 631. That was a case where the applicant had been sentenced in the Local Court. Upon appeal to the District Court, the fine imposed below was quashed and, in lieu, a sentence of periodic detention was imposed. The applicant was granted bail pending an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He did not attend for periodic detention pending the hearing of the appeal, but no order was made staying the execution of the sentence during that period. The appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was later conceded to be incompetent and dismissed. A subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. The Court of Appeal, however, by majority, purported to vary the sentence which had been imposed, so that the time spent on bail would not be counted as part of his sentence.  
      
       
     43 It was not a Court which possessed the statutory power possessed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (s18(3) Criminal Appeal Act) to vary a sentence so as to take account of the period spent on bail. Mason, Murphy, Wilson and Deane JJ, in refusing special leave to appeal to the High Court, said at 635-6: 
      
       
        
         
         “A sentence of imprisonment, like any other court order, must operate in accordance with its terms as interpreted in the context of any statutory provisions pursuant to which it is imposed or framed. If the sentence does not itself direct that the term of imprisonment which the offender is ordered to serve be a period commencing on a particular day or if overriding statutory provisions do not have that effect, the term of imprisonment will ordinarily commence when the offender is taken into custody and begins to serve it. The framing of the sentence or the effect of overriding statutory provision can however, intentionally or inadvertently, be such that the imprisonment to which an offender is sentenced is imprisonment during a period which is identified by reference to a nominated specific commencing date. In such a case, if the offender fails to serve the term of imprisonment imposed, he may be guilty of some further offence (see, e.g.,  
         Periodic Detention of Prisoners 
           
         Act 
         ,  
         s.33 
         ). In the absence of statutory provision or valid court order to the contrary however, the term or period during which the offender is sentenced to be imprisoned will commence on the designated day. 
          
          
         On our reading of the  
         Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 
         , the specification of a commencing date does not itself form part of the sentence. The commencing date must however be identified by the sentencing court in order that the procedures of that Act may be applied to the sentence of imprisonment.  
         Section 8 
          of the  
         Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act 
          expressly provides that the sentence ""shall commence"" on the date specified in the order imposing the sentence. There is nothing in  
         the Act 
          which qualifies that clear provision. That being so, its effect is that the period or term of imprisonment which the person sentenced is required to serve is the period or term commencing on that designated date. 
          
          
         The fact that the applicant did not actually commence to serve the 
          
         sentence of imprisonment did not, in itself, prevent the term of the sentence from commencing to run. In that regard, it is to be recalled that not even escape from custody had the effect, at common law, of preventing a term of imprisonment from continuing to run (In re Court (1871) 2 QSCR 171; Wilson v. Attorney-General (1938) NZLR 496).” 
         
        
       
     44 Brennan J said at 642-643: 
      
       
        
         
         “The grant of bail in the present case effectively cancelled the sentence and allowed the applicant to ""escape from punishment and laugh at justice"". Although that consequence was unintended, it does not follow that the Court of Appeal had inherent jurisdiction to impose a sentence to make up for the sentence avoided. The limits of the inherent jurisdiction are determined primarily by reference to the purposes served by its exercise, the chief among 
          
         them being control of the court's procedure, suppression of abuses of its process, preventing attempts to thwart its process, and ensuring fairness in its proceedings (see Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1964) AC 1254, at pp 1301, 1347). The authorities are helpfully reviewed by Mr Mason Q.C. and by Master Jacob in their respective articles on the inherent jurisdiction: Australian Law Journal, vol.57 (1983), 449 and Current Legal Problems, vol.23 (1970), 23. The inherent jurisdiction is not closely circumscribed, but it does not extend to sentencing a convicted person to a term of imprisonment in addition to, or in substitution for, a term of imprisonment which was not served because the court had bailed the prisoner during the term. If the processes of the Court were abused by the seeking of bail, the suppression of the abuse lay in refusing bail or, perhaps, in revoking the bail once granted. If the seeking of bail in the present case were an abuse, it was not to be remedied by imposing what is in truth a new sentence. The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction, either inherent or statutory, to make the order under appeal.” 
         
        
        
       
     45 Whan v McConachy was applied by this Court in Regina v Nunan [1999] NSWCCA 117. That was a case where the applicant had initially been granted bail upon an assumption, which later proved to be incorrect, that she had filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, from a sentence of imprisonment for 10 weeks. By the time that the case came before the Court, following the grant of an extension of time to file the appeal, the 10 weeks contemplated by the sentence had expired by effluxion of time, although the sentence had not in fact been served. 
      
       
     46 The applicant argued that in those circumstances, there was no need to address the application and that there was no basis for her to be taken into custody. Spigelman CJ, with whom James and Bell JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my view the absence of an appeal to this Court prevents the statutory description within s 18(2) [of the Criminal Appeal Act] being satisfied on the facts of this case, for the same reasons that the High Court in Whan v McConaughy concluded in that case, with respect to the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act there under consideration. In my opinion, s 8 of the Sentencing Act is to the same effect. Time continued to run under the sentences originally imposed by her Honour. Section 18(2) was, as I have indicated above, the only provision which could have had a relevant consequence. On its proper construction, in my view, it did not have that consequence.” 
         
        
       
     47 The question which therefore arises is whether, similarly to these cases, the Respondent can claim that during the period between 26 May 2000 and 18 July 2001, he is to be taken, as a matter of law, to have been serving either the substituted sentence, or the original order for periodic detention, even though he was not in custody, and upon that basis to have that period taken into account – either by leaving the order announced on 26 May 2000 intact, or by setting that period off any amended sentence. 
      
       
     48 The present case is not one of unlawful absence to which either s 40 or s 254(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act  1999 would apply – each of which would have to be taken into account in determining how much of the sentence the inmate should be taken to have served during that period of absence. Nor is it a case where the original order had been stayed or where the Respondent was on bail pending the final determination of the appeal, to which s 18(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act would have applied, so as to exclude the time on bail as being part of the sentence. 
      
       
     49 It is, however, a case where, in the absence of the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal having been perfected, the original sentence of periodic detention remained on foot. Although at one time the Parole Board made an order revoking it, that order was itself revoked with the consequence, it may be assumed, that the original order was left in force.  
      
       
     50 This requires that reference be made to the Crimes (Administration of Sentence) Act 1999 and in particular to sections 82 and 89, which provide respectively:  
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         82 Duration of periodic detention order 
          
         (1) Unless sooner revoked, an offender’s periodic detention order expires: 
          
         (a) at the end of the term of the sentence to which it relates, or 
          
         (b) when the offender is released on parole, 
          
         whichever occurs first. 
          
         (2) Any detention period or part of a detention period during which an offender is in custody (whether in relation to the offence concerned or otherwise and whether as an inmate of a correctional centre or otherwise) is taken to have been served by the offender in accordance with this Part. 
          
         (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 89. 
         
        
        
         
         .. 
         
        
        
         
         89 Failure to report or reporting late extends term of sentence 
          
         (1) The sentence to be served by an offender who fails to report for one or more detention periods (whether or not leave of absence is granted) is, by this subsection, extended by one week for each detention period for which the offender fails to report. 
          
         (2) The sentence to be served by an offender who reports late for one or more detention periods (otherwise than where leave of absence is granted) is, by this subsection, extended by one week for each detention period for which the offender reports late. 
          
         (3) The sentence to be served by an offender: 
          
         (a) who reports late for one or more detention periods, and 
          
         (b) who is granted leave of absence subject to a requirement that an equivalent period of time to that for which leave is granted is to be served as part of an additional detention period, is, by this subsection, extended by one week for each additional detention period necessary to accommodate the total period of time directed to be served by all such directions given in relation to that sentence. 
          
         (4) The sentence to be served by an offender who fails to report, or who reports late, for one or more detention periods (otherwise than where leave of absence is granted) is, by this subsection, further extended by one week for each detention period for which the offender fails to report or reports late. 
          
         (5) An offender’s sentence may not be extended by subsection (4) by more than 6 weeks. 
          
         (6) Any extension by subsection (4) of an offender’s sentence is in addition to any extension by subsection (1), (2) or (3) of that sentence with respect to the same failure to report or lateness in reporting.  
          
         (7) In this section, a reference to the extension of an offender’s sentence is a reference to: 
          
         (a) the extension of the term of the sentence, and 
          
         (b) if the relevant failure to report or reporting late occurs during a non-parole period of the sentence, the extension of the non-parole period of the sentence. 
          
         (8) If an offender has failed to report for a detention period but during that detention period is taken into custody (whether in relation to the offence concerned or otherwise and whether as an inmate of a correctional centre or otherwise), the offender is for the purposes of this section taken to have reported late for that detention period without leave of absence.” 
         
        
       
     51 It is common ground that the applicant did not report after 26 May 2000, and remained at large notwithstanding the warrant, until his arrest in July 2001. I see no reason why such conduct should not be regarded as a failure to report.  
      
       
     52 It follows, in my view that, during the period between 26 May 2000 and at least 18 July 2001 (and possibly until the order of this Court is perfected - by reason of ss (8)), the sentence of periodic detention should be regarded as having been extended by one week for each of the detention periods, in respect of which such failure occurred. 
      
       
     53 The present case is, upon this basis, distinguishable from Whan. If the sentence of periodic detention was now to be served, it would be extended at least by an equivalent period to that for which the Respondent was at large, together with any penalty extension arising under s 89(4) of the Act. I would not, however, be minded to reflect that last mentioned consideration, or to direct that the sentence commence any later than 15 July 2001, when the order of the Court is corrected. 
      
       
     54 In all of these circumstances, and in order to achieve the result which the Court intended on 26 May 2000, I am of the view that it should now intervene and vary the sentencing order proposed by Grove J on 26 May 2000. In lieu the following orders should be made:  
      
       
        
       1. Crown appeal allowed; 
        
        
       2. Sentences imposed below be quashed; 
        
        
       3. In lieu thereof the Respondent be sentenced, on each count, to imprisonment for 3 years, each to be served concurrently, to commence on 15 July 2001, and to expire on 14 July 2004; 
        
        
       4. A non parole period be set, for each count, of 2 years and 3 months to commence on 15 July 2001 and to expire on 14 October 2003; 
        
        
       5. Respondent to be released to parole on 15 October 2003. 
        
        
       
     55 I would add that it would now be sensible for there to be an amendment to the Criminal Appeal Act to address the several circumstances, now identified, where an offender has been deemed to have been serving a sentence of imprisonment during a period when he or she was in fact at large. There can be no justification for any offender receiving an unintended windfall in having that period counted against the sentence. 
      
       
     56 SULLY J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL 
      
       
     57 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and with his Honour’s reasons.

      REGINA v KYLE RAYMOND GUIVARRA 
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Grove J to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by Finnane DCJ on the respondent at Sydney District Court. The respondent appeared before his Honour on a single count of malicious wounding having been committed for sentence after pleading guilty to that offence before a Magistrate. The maximum prescribed penalty is seven years imprisonment. The learned Judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for two years but directed that the imprisonment be suspended on condition that the respondent enter into a recognizance to be of good behaviour, such recognizance to be current for the whole of that term. 
      
       
     3 The respondent was born on 14 January 1970. For about ten years prior to September 2000 the respondent and one Penny Jarrett had lived in a de facto relationship. There are no children of that relationship, the respondent having been rendered sterile as a result of critical illness and treatment in his childhood. The relationship terminated and Miss Jarrett commenced a relationship with one Richard Hoskins.  
      
       
     4 At about 12.30pm on 25 September 2000 the respondent was driving in Maroubra, a suburb in which he had lived for many years and in which Miss Jarrett and Mr Hoskins were also living, when he passed Miss Jarrett and her sister who were walking dogs. There was some dispute as to the ownership of one of the dogs but as he drove past the respondent made insulting remarks to his former girlfriend. 
      
       
     5 Shortly thereafter he arrived at the victim’s premises. The respondent raised the question of ownership of the dog with Miss Jarrett’s sister. Mr Hoskins emerged from the premises and an argument ensued between the two men, in the course of which Mr Hoskins struck the respondent with a golf club. A fight continued until they were separated by Miss Jarrett’s brother. 
      
       
     6 The respondent left the scene but returned in his car shortly thereafter. He was armed with a long bladed knife. He testified to Finnane DCJ that that knife had at all times been in his car. He had not journeyed for the express purpose of collecting it. Be that as it may, whilst armed with it he called out to Mr Hoskins who emerged again from his premises armed with an extendable baton. Fighting between the two men resumed in the course of which the respondent used his knife to stab Mr Hoskins twice in the abdomen.  
      
       
     7 Mr Hoskins sought sanctuary in a nearby TAB agency from which he was in due course transferred to hospital. Emergency surgery stemmed his bleeding and he was discharged from the hospital four days later. Whilst the wounded Mr Hoskins was within the TAB premises the respondent continued aggressive actions and language which included doing some damage to the TAB building. He was arrested at his place of work about two days later. 
      
       
     8 The respondent appeared for sentence on 19 February 2001 on which occasion the learned Judge at first instance adjourned the proceedings for nine months making particular reference to the respondent’s undertaking anger management counselling and overcoming an apparent addiction to marijuana. During the period of remand he was required to report to police three times per week. Prior to that whilst on bail he had been reporting to police daily. When the respondent reappeared for sentence on 9 November 2001 his Honour imposed the sentence which I have mentioned.  
      
       
     9 The Crown’s submission is that the sentence imposed failed adequately to reflect the objective gravity of the offence. It is acknowledged by the Crown that there were significant subjective factors to be taken into account. A submission by the Crown adverted to the apparent absence of attempts by the sentencing Judge to undertake the “two step process” referred to by Kirby J in The Queen v Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321, that is to say, first a determination of whether a sentence of full time imprisonment was appropriate and second whether the circumstances were such as to lead to a further determination that the sentence should be suspended. It has been observed that it does not follow that every failure to advert to the two stage process mentioned by Kirby J requires a conclusion that this court must set aside the sentence and to proceed to re sentence R v Foster [2001] NSWCCA 215 per Badgery-Parker AJ, (Giles JA and Greg James J agreeing). Foster has been cited with approval in Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. 
      
       
     10 Some mention should be made of the subjective factors. Although the respondent did not have an entirely clear record there had been no entry since 1993 when he was convicted of an offence relating to a dog and fined. Other offences were dealt with by fine except that in 1991 he had been placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for one year for common assault. He kept the recognizance. He was one of two children who were left to be raised by their mother when the respondent was aged about two. I have already mentioned his serious illness and chemotherapy treatment whilst he was a young person. About five years prior to appearing before his Honour he had cared for his mother in her final illness. He had had little or no contact with his father for many years. Whilst he was growing up his father had achieved responsible positions in relation to both Australian organisations concerned with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and representation upon a United Nations body in relation to indigenous people. When the respondent was charged with this matter his father became reinvolved with him and it was noted by his Honour that the respondent’s father, whose place of residence and principal activity are centred upon Melbourne, had attended in support of him.  
      
       
     11 His Honour had the benefit of two reports from probation and parole officers, one prepared prior to the proceedings in February which led to the adjournment and another for the final period. He also had reports concerning the rehabilitation progress of the respondent. It is true that the respondent’s progress was not perfect but his Honour was in a position to make a judgment about the extent and significance of progress. He found that the respondent complied with the conditions fixed and on the whole behaved in a responsible manner. That finding has not been shown to be wrong. 
      
       
     12 The Court has been referred to a number of cases for comparative purposes. For example R v Zamagias (above cited) where a sentence similar to the present was, on Crown appeal, replaced with a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention with a non parole period of one year and nine months. However, that case involved a trial pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes Act which involved intent and carries the prescribed maximum penalty of twenty five years imprisonment, in contrast with the statutory maximum of seven years applicable to the respondent’s crime. We were also referred to R v Kama [2000] NSWCCA 23 where the victim suffered what was described as “an extremely severe brain injury”. The primary Judge had imposed a sentence of penal servitude for twenty seven months comprising a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of eighteen months to be served by way of periodic detention. On Crown appeal the Court increased the sentence to a minimum term of two years together with an additional term of one year, again the sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. In the course of his judgment Spigelman CJ pointed out that this offence (under s35 of the Crimes Act) is one which can vary to an extraordinary extent particularly in terms of the severity of an attack. Although Finnane DCJ quite rightly, if I may say with respect, observed that the respondent “had no cause at all to approach Mr Hoskins with a knife, much less to stab him”, a judgment on severity of attack must necessarily take into account the overall circumstances which included the extendable baton with which Mr Hoskins armed himself and which he used. 
      
       
     13 The principal thrust of the Crown’s argument was directed towards the order made by his Honour suspending service of the sentence of imprisonment. It was not directed to the assessment of two years imprisonment as such. It was submitted that there had to be something “special, exceptional or unusual” about the case for the court to conclude that it was appropriate to place the respondent on recognizance rather than ordering him to serve the sentence.  
      
       
     14 The court was taken to remarks in R v Zamagias (supra) including a statement about the scale of escalating severity expressed in Regina v LRS [2001] NSWCCA 338. It is unnecessary to dispose of this appeal to investigate the applicability or the validity of that scale in every circumstance.  
      
       
     15 In my opinion Finnane DCJ has not been shown to be wrong in reaching his conclusion. In addition to the matters which I have mentioned, his Honour was also made aware that Mr Hoskins and Miss Jarrett had relocated to Queensland the likelihood of further friction was removed by distance, as well as the apparent progress of the respondent towards rehabilitation. Although after being charged and appearing in court on the first occasion the respondent’s employment had taken a turn for the worse, he had throughout his life generally been in active employment. Although the injury to the victim was no doubt threatening in the absence of treatment, he was discharged from hospital after four days without any indication of any need for further treatment. These are but factors to be weighed in the balance in order to determine whether the sentence and order were in all the circumstances manifestly inadequate. As I have indicated, in my view, that has not been demonstrated. 
      
       
     16 I would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     17 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
      
       
     18 SMART AJ: I have found this appeal quite troubling as it involves the respondent stabbing the victim in the stomach. Initially I was disposed to think the sentence was manifestly inadequate. It was certainly very lenient. However, on further consideration and having regard to the views of my brothers, I am not prepared to dissent from the orders which they propose. 
      
       
     19 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order is as indicated by Grove J.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA:  After a hearing over 22 to 26 May, or at least over parts of those days, on Monday 29 May 2000 Dent DCJ QC found a verdict for the defendant in relation to the plaintiff’s claim for damages for personal injuries. This is an appeal by the plaintiff against that order, seeking a new trial. 
      
       
     2 The background was described thus by the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff’s case is based upon a sale transaction and advice given to him which he alleges occurred at the defendant’s place of business at Narellan shortly before the accident of 15 March 1996. The evidence discloses that at and significantly prior to the date of the accident the plaintiff was a concreting contractor operating that business in an advertised name suggesting his wife had an interest in it which apparently on the tax returns provided in evidence she did not in fact have, from what appears to be the family home at 20 Morgan Street Miller New South Wales. The plaintiff held the appropriate licence to trade in his own name since 1995. By that time he had become a person long skilled in his avocation able to quote for jobs as well as physically perform the tasks of laying concrete and skilfully decorating it by what is known as stencilling. As at the date of the accident the plaintiff’s tools of trade included a Bosch electrically powered angle grinder. This portable machine was not produced in evidence but one similar to it was entered in evidence by the defendant after the plaintiff identified it as a similar machine. The machine was designed to use inter alia cutting discs up to nine inches in diameter and it was fitted with a part circumferential metal guard which would only permit discs up to nine inches in diameter to be fitted and used on it. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff in the course of his business used this machine to cut expansion joints in concrete fabrications that had been laid. He had, he says, up until the subject accident used Flexivit 9-inch discs for this purpose. This practice was followed on smaller jobs. For bigger jobs he hired concrete cutting saws. The type of angle grinding machine used by the plaintiff is a widely used device. The cutting discs used are widely used devices by both tradesmen and handymen. The guard fitting to that machine serves a number of obvious purposes. It protects the hand of the operator from the disc, it protects the operator from detritus expelled as part of the cutting process. It provides protection to the operator from the consequences of a disc fracturing at high speed and propelling fragments towards the operator’s body.  
         
        
        
         
         Attachment of a disc to a grinder requires the use of metal flanges which fit over the spindle shaft of the grinder on either side of the disc. The flanges are circular. The flange nearest the grinder body drops over the threaded spindle shaft and slots into its base so as to lock it to the shaft. The disc has a bore hole in its centre. The disc is then placed around the spindle shaft so as to rest against the inner flange. The outer flange is then dropped over the threaded spindle shaft or screwed down the threads to the disc and screwed down the threads to the disc or bolted on the threads of the spindle. The outer flange has a central fixed circular protuberance or boss which mates exactly into the bore hole in the disc. When the outer flange is screwed down or bolted down the disc is then precisely centred on the spindle and the disc is attached to the spindle by the compression of the outer flange on to it by screwing the outer flange down on its own thread or it would seem bolting it down to the disc by a separate bolt. A 9-inch Flexivit disc was introduced by the plaintiff as exhibit B in these proceedings. A 12-inch Flexivit disc was introduced as exhibit C. 
         
        
        
         
         On Exhibit B the 9-inch disc of Flexivit brand which was the brand used by the plaintiff prior to the accident, the following information appears. ‘Flexivit made in Australia cut off wheel and various descriptive numbers’. On the left of the disc ‘flanges must be fitted as illustrated below on the right of the disc.’ Then a diagram is given under the ‘flanges must be fitted’ on the left side of the disc headed ‘incorrect mounting’ and the words under that, flanges not equal in diameter showing a distortion of the disc. On the right-hand side of the disc appears the words ‘correct mounting blotter, flanges are equal in diameter. The disc is described as a stone disc with identifying numbers under it followed by the following words, ‘Warning cutting wheels must be mounted correctly. Metal guard must be used on all machines. Danger, do not exceed maximum safe speed. Flanges must be one-third of the diameter of the wheel.’ In the central or what appears to be the blotter area of the disc it is advised that the disc is to be used at revolutions per minute not exceeding 6,800.  
         
        
        
         
         On Exhibit C, the 12-inch Flexivit disc, the following information appears. ‘Flexivit made in Australia.’ On the left a numerical description of it with the words ‘max RPM 6,200.’ The same incorrect mounting and correct mounting are described. A warning is given that the flanges must be equal in diameter. The following warning is then given. ‘Cutting wheels must be mounted correctly. Metal guard must be used on all machines. Danger. Do not exceed maximum safe speed. Flanges must be one-third the diameter of wheel.’ These discs have no cutting teeth as such but cut by high speed abrasion of the material to which they are applied. The disc also abrades away as it is used, until its diameter is reduced to a point where it is unserviceable.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     3 The crucial aspect of the plaintiff’s evidence was summarised by the trial judge as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff testifies that on some date in March 1996 prior to 15 he attended at the defendant’s large premises at Narellan to buy a cutting disc for his grinder in the company of his brother-in-law Hass. He says that he had done business there before. He went to the disc stand and spent some time there. He was concerned to obtain a cutting disc with a longer cutting life than the ones he had been using. He testifies that whilst he was looking, a male person approached him wearing a blue T-shirt with the Mitre 10 motif and said ‘Can I help you’ or words to that effect. The plaintiff says he said words to the effect of ‘I am looking for a 9-inch disc for concrete cutting expansion joints’. He says the man showed him a 9-inch disc. He says he said to the man ‘Do you have any bigger disc?’ and the man said ‘Yes’. He says he told the man ‘I want a bigger disc to last longer. I want to use it on a 9-inch grinder’. He says the man said ‘You can use it’. He said he said to the man ‘What about the safety guard?’ and the man said to him ‘You can take it off’. He says he then said to the man ‘Is there any danger if I take the safety guard off?’ and the man said ‘No we have never had one of these break before’ or words to that effect. He says he then examined the 12-inch disc he was given and saw it was not possible to use it without removing the safety guard on his grinder. The plaintiff testifies he then purchased the 12-inch disc because of the man’s assurance that it had never broken before. 
         
        
        
         
         I observe at this point that the 12-inch disc has a larger bore hole than a 9-inch disc and quite obviously could not be precisely centrally located to the spindle by an outer flange which would locate a 9-inch disc.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     4 The plaintiff’s evidence as to the injury sued on was summarised thus by the trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff says that on the day of the accident he was working the second day of a job at a home in Thompson Street Camden. He says he decided to cut expansion joints with his grinder. His brother-in-law, Hass, stood on a board forming a straight edge for him. He cut with the 9-inch disc on the grinder until it, that is the disc, was finished. He then replaced it with the 12-inch disc. To do this he took the guard off. He started cutting with the disc. It started wobbling. He stopped and checked it for tightness. He started it up again and it worked all right. He cut a further one to one and a half feet of the expansion joint when the disc broke. A fragment from the unguarded disc flew at him and gave him a terrible wound to his left lower arm from which he has never made full recovery in function and for which he on the probabilities never will.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     5 The operative parts of the trial judge’s reasoning were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff has never been able to identify the man at the defendants who served him. The defendant produced and identified in court all of its staff who could have served him in the period he nominates and he identifies none of them although he looked closely at two before he was able to positively swear that they were not the person that had served him. The plaintiff’s case on liability is founded on an alleged conversation in the defendant’s store when he says he was in effect advised it was safe to use a 12-inch disc on a grinder without the guard on it. I observed that that was extraordinary advice to give but all things are possible in this life. If it was given and acted on, it would give the plaintiff a strong sense of grievance against the fool who gave it and the employee foolish enough to employ that fool. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff’s only confrontation or attempt at confrontation of the wrongdoer apart from one visit to the store on his solicitor’s advice to seek to identify who had served him, was the service of the subject statement of claim three years after the event. The plaintiff called his brother-in-law, Hass, to verify the fact of acquisition of the disc from the defendant and to explain the destruction of the purchase docket. In the process of cleaning up the plaintiff’s truck he also explained that he had collected and thrown out the disc fragments from the disc that shattered and injured the plaintiff. He said that this cleaning up of the plaintiff’s truck was something that they did for the plaintiff. This witness is selective in his recollections and quite unconvincing. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff called his wife to explain the loss of the subject grinder. She swore it was lost in a fire in her garage well after the accident. She is an unconvincing witness who says that whilst this was the real cause of the loss of the grinder, she told her husband that it had been stolen instead for the unconvincing reasons that she gives. This evidence was given against the background of a defendant’s solicitor pre trial having asked the plaintiff’s solicitor to provide the grinder for inspection. The plaintiff’s solicitor on instructions from the plaintiff had responded that it was not available as it had been stolen from the plaintiff’s truck at Narellan. The absence of the grinder of course was significant. It was implicit in the plaintiff’s case it had not been used by him since the accident and of course the flanges fitted to it at the time of the tragedy may have been of significance in explaining its occurrence. The plaintiff gives evidence of flange changing to use the bigger disc on the grinder which of itself is far from convincing and his testimony is that he just happened to have a set of flanges in his tool box on his truck which had a box which would fit the bore hole of the 12-inch disc. The plaintiff called his cousin Steve who contradicted Hass’s evidence as to who it was who cleaned up the cabin of the plaintiff’s truck after the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         All of the above evidence was called for the purpose of clearing up the loose ends in the plaintiff’s case. Unfortunately it did not. It rather presented an imbroglio leaving me, the trial judge, unable to clearly discern where truth lies as opposed to creative reconstruction. Learned counsel for the plaintiff criticises the defendant’s identification parade in court and submits that each of the 11 salesmen called should have been sworn to testify that they did not advise the plaintiff as alleged or anyone as alleged and the like. The procuring of these persons to this Court from Narellan for the identification parade must have been enormously disruptive of the defendant’s enterprise and given the circumstances it can be seen as a forensic exercise in fairness to the plaintiff that led the plaintiff’s case nowhere. 
         
        
        
         
         I am deeply conscious that no one expressly refutes the defendant’s sworn testimony that he was relevantly advised as I have referred to above. What I have to finally determine is whether I am persuaded by the plaintiff’s testimony that on the balance of probability the advice upon which he says was given and that he relied upon it to his peril. The alternative proposition is that he chose to use the larger disc of his own decision. I confess I am unable to find in this tarnished imbroglio that more probably than not the advice the plaintiff swears was given, was given at all.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
     6 The grounds of appeal are largely directed to the concluding observation of the trial judge that he was “unable to find that more probably than not the advice the plaintiff swears was given, was given at all”. 
      
       
     7 The plaintiff’s arguments in written submissions to this Court were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The ultimate question of fact which his Honour himself posed for determination was whether the advice which the plaintiff said was given, and which the plaintiff relied upon to his peril, was given at all, or whether the plaintiff chose to use the larger disc of his own decision … 
         
        
        
         
         This formulation strongly suggests, at least implicitly and in the absence of any findings to the contrary, that his Honour must have accepted that the plaintiff - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) had, indeed, purchased the twelve inch disc from the defendant; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) had been injured as a consequence of its use in the circumstances of which the plaintiff had testified.  
         
        
        
         
         In those circumstances, most of the matters in respect of which his Honour made findings as to the credit of witnesses - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) in respect of the plaintiff, as to whether there had been flange changing before the accident; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) in respect of the plaintiff’s wife, as to what she had said had happened to the grinder after the accident; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) in respect of the plaintiff’s brother-in-law, Hass, as to the destruction of the purchase docket and the disc fragments from the disc that had shattered and injured the plaintiff; and 
         
        
        
         
         (d) in respect of the plaintiff’s cousin, Steve, as to who he had said cleaned up the truck after the accident 
         
        
        
         
         could not rationally affect his Honour’s assessment of the probability of a fact in issue, namely, that, more probably than not, the advice the plaintiff said was given when he had purchased the twelve inch disc from the defendant was in fact given. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff’s uncontradicted evidence was that the plaintiff made known expressly to the defendant’s salesman, before the plaintiff purchased the twelve inch disc, that he wanted a bigger disc than the nine inch disc for the purpose of using it on a nine inch grinder, and that the plaintiff was relying on the salesman’s judgment that the plaintiff could safely use a bigger disc with the safety guard off. … 
         
        
        
         
         Whether uncontradicted evidence should be accepted must depend on all the circumstances of the case, including its inherent probability and the possibility of calling evidence in denial. … 
         
        
        
         
         Whether the advice which the plaintiff said was given, and whether the plaintiff relied upon it to his peril, were questions of fact to be answered by examining all the evidence as to what was said and done with regard to the proposed transaction on either side from its first inception to the conclusion of the agreement to purchase. … 
         
        
        
         
         What the plaintiff did not do after the conclusion of that agreement, in particular, that the plaintiff did not confront or attempt to confront the salesman after the accident also could not rationally affect his Honour’s assessment of the probability of the fact in issue whether the plaintiff had been advised as the plaintiff alleged that he had been. 
         
        
        
         
         There being no finding that the plaintiff’s sworn testimony that he was relevantly advised as he alleged was inherently improbable, the circumstances of the case that - 
         
        
        
         
         (a) the plaintiff’s only ‘ 
         confrontation or attempt at confrontation of the wrongdoer 
         ’, apart from one visit to the store on his solicitor’s advice to seek to identify who had served him, was the service of the subject Statement of Claim three years after the event; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) the plaintiff had never been able to identify the man at the defendant’s who served him, including from among the defendant’s staff produced and identified in Court as all of its staff who could have served him in the period he nominated 
         
        
        
         
         might rationally affect whether his Honour believed the plaintiff’s evidence that the advice the plaintiff said was given was, in fact given, but only if the defendant had adduced contrary evidence to the effect that such advice had not been given.  
         
        
        
         
         In any event, however, such circumstances could scarcely have the probative value which his Honour apparently ascribed to them; otherwise, plaintiffs who failed to confront or identify the particular person in a defendant’s employ who had done them wrong would invariably fail in claims such as the present. 
         
        
        
         
         The defendant’s failure to call each of the salesmen to the witness box, or to lead evidence which could amount to a reasonable explanation for not doing so, permitted his Honour to infer that the untendered evidence would not have helped the defendant, and would have entitled his Honour the more readily to find that, more probably than not, the advice the plaintiff said was given was in fact given. 
         
        
        
         
         That his Honour may have been ‘ 
         deeply conscious 
         ’ that no-one expressly refuted the plaintiff’s sworn testimony that he was relevantly advised as alleged (red AB 021P) does not demonstrate that his Honour treated the unexplained failure in the manner to which the plaintiff was entitled to have it treated. … 
         
        
        
         
         In all the circumstances of the case, including his Honour’s reasons or lack of them, by concluding that he was ‘ 
         unable to find 
         ’ that the advice the plaintiff swore was given at all, his Honour failed to use or palpably misused his advantage in having seen the witnesses of the plaintiff only.” 
         
        
       
     8 It is convenient to deal with the plaintiff’s written submissions and his oral submissions to be noted below, on the assumption that what is said early in the quoted written submissions is correct, namely that the trial judge did accept that the plaintiff had purchased the twelve inch disk from the defendant and had been injured as a consequence of its use in the circumstances described by the plaintiff in evidence. Whether the trial judge was in fact making implicit findings to that effect is a difficult question which need not be determined.  
      
       
     9 Apart from the written submissions, there were additional oral arguments. One of these related to the relationship between the plaintiff’s failure to complain about the advice and its causal connection with his injury and the trial judge’s inability to be satisfied as to his account of the advice. Counsel for the plaintiff in this Court submitted that in a passage not recorded on the transcript the trial judge observed of the plaintiff “he is from the Levant”, that is, he would be likely to complain if he had a ground for complaint. No submission based on this can be accepted. There is no evidence of the trial judge having said that. There is no ground of appeal relating to any bias on the part of the trial judge. In any event, the force, or lack of force, of the trial judge’s reasoning would be the same even if the observation had been made. The trial judge’s point is that any person in the plaintiff’s position, injured as the plaintiff was, wherever he came from, might be expected to confront the defendant, or at least to identify the employee who gave the advice in issue. 
      
       
     11 Other oral arguments advanced by the plaintiff will be considered at the appropriate stage below. 
      
       
     12 Underlying the plaintiff’s arguments is the contention advanced in paragraph 5 of the Notice of Appeal, namely that the trial judge gave inadequate reasons. It is true that the reasons for judgment do not contain just before or just after the trial judge’s statement of his conclusion a set of discrete grounds for it. He did not say that he found the plaintiff’s demeanour unsatisfactory. He did not point to internal contradictions in the plaintiff’s evidence, rendering it unworthy of acceptance. He did not explicitly point to contradictions between the plaintiff’s evidence and other evidence which was either incontrovertible or acceptable. He did not rely on any admission by conduct stemming from the evidence of the witnesses called by the plaintiff, namely his wife, his brother-in-law and his cousin, which was both conflicting and unsatisfactory; indeed, in the absence of verbal admissions or admissions by conduct on the part of the plaintiff personally in cross-examination, this would not have been possible. 
      
       
     13 However, throughout the reasons for judgment there are stated matters capable of operating as reasons for the trial judge’s conclusion and in fact apparently supporting his reasons. Whether they do so sufficiently was the question raised by other parts of the plaintiff’s submissions. These matters may be summarised as follows, with some amplification of their significance. 
      
       
     14 First, the trial judge said that if the advice alleged by the plaintiff had been given, it was “extraordinary advice to give but all things are possible in this life”. The reason why it was extraordinary is that the defendant’s Mitre 10 store appeared no doubt to be a substantial operation with eleven relevant employees. It would conform with the judge’s general experience of life that that type of shop, usually staffed by persons of adequate skill and persons not prone to recklessness, would not have advised changing machinery capable of inflicting serious injury so as to remove safety features. The unlikelihood of an employee doing so would stem from the commercial interests of the employer and from common humanity.  
      
       
     15 Secondly, the trial judge believed, and was entitled to believe, the evidence called by the defendant to the effect that the eleven persons produced in court comprised the totality of the staff who could have served the plaintiff. Mr Salter’s evidence to that effect appeared to be careful and was based on contemporary business records which were made available to the plaintiff. He was closely cross-examined. He made various small mistakes and changed testimony in a manner suggesting he was attempting to recall the events of four years earlier in a sincere fashion as he responded to each question. With all respect to the ability of the cross-examination, it did not shake Mr Salter; and the trial judge’s finding that all the staff who could have served the plaintiff had been produced is not to be overturned in this Court. It is a finding capable of operating as a reason for his conclusion.  
      
       
     17 Thirdly, the plaintiff positively denied that any of the eleven men who attended the court served him. Had he been unsure about some of them, there might have been point in calling them, but since the plaintiff out of his own mouth denied that they had served him, it would have been superfluous for the defendant to duplicate that evidence by calling each of them to deny having served the plaintiff. 
      
       
     18 Fourthly, had the conversation happened as the plaintiff said, the trial judge said this would have given the plaintiff a strong sense of grievance against the employee in question and the defendant. The accident happened on 15 March 1996 and the conversation occurred, to the extent that it occurred, only days before that date. Yet the plaintiff did not confront the defendant and the first that the defendant knew about the allegations against it was on receipt of the Statement of Claim three years later. The trial judge evidently thought it open to infer from the failure to complain speedily that there was little to complain about. Alternatively, it could be inferred that whatever was said might, with the passing of time, have become reconstructed into a form which might assist the case which the plaintiff eventually brought. 
      
       
     19 Fifthly, the trial judge noted that there was no documentary evidence of purchase and that both the disk fragments and the grinder were not tendered. The loss of those items, for whatever reason, made it harder to check the plaintiff’s version of events in relation to some parts of his case. The plaintiff had the onus of proving that case and the loss of those items increased the judge’s difficulty in being satisfied on the balance of probabilities in relation to other parts. The trial judge said: “The absence of the grinder of course was significant. It was implicit in the plaintiff’s case it had not been used by him since the accident and of course the flanges fitted to it at the time of the tragedy may have been of significance in explaining its occurrence.” 
      
       
     20 Sixthly, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff gives evidence of flange changing to use the bigger disc on the grinder which of itself is far from convincing and his testimony is that he just happened to have a set of flanges in his tool box on his truck which had a boss which would fit the bore hole of the 12-inch disc.” 
         
        
       
     21 It is true that the trial judge did not say why the evidence was not convincing. It is also not clear whether the trial judge actually rejected the evidence. But that obscurity does not alter the fact that when the judgment is read as a whole, reasons can be found in it for the conclusion of which the plaintiff complains. Whether they are satisfactory reasons is the next question for consideration. 
      
       
     22 In essence, the question is whether the reasons given by the trial judge are so unsatisfactory in point of validity as to justify an order for a new trial. In oral argument, the issue was posed as being whether the trial judge had failed to use or abused a position of advantage enjoyed by him in relation to the hearing of the testimony of the witnesses. 
      
       
     23 While the requirement in civil cases that the trier of fact be satisfied on the balance of probabilities has been called an undemanding standard, it has some reality. Traditionally there are two approaches to its application. One is to demonstrate that the odds of the fact existing or the event happening which the plaintiff is seeking to establish are at least fifty one to forty nine (Davies v Taylor [1974] AC 207 at 219). In view of the inherent unlikelihood of a Mitre 10 salesman saying what the plaintiff alleged, that criterion could not be satisfied, but, as the trial judge said, the conversation could have happened, despite its improbability. This requires the trier of fact to turn to the other approach. On that approach, the trier of fact must 
      
       
        
         
         “feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. [At] common law it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation be made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the Tribunal.” ( 
         Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
          (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 361-2 per Dixon J; see also  
         Jones v Sutherland Shire Council 
          [1979] 2 NSWLR 206 at 227 per Mahoney JA). 
         
        
       
     25 The trial judge did not find that the conversation occurred and did not find that it did not occur. Rather he took a third course, which was an available one. In Rehsa Shipping Co SA v Edmunds [1985] 1 WLR 948 at 955-6; [1985] 2 All ER 71 Lord Brandon of Oakbrook said: 
      
       
        
         
         “the judge is not bound always to make a finding one way or the other with regard to the facts averred by the parties. He has open to him the third alternative of saying that the party on whom the burden of proof lies in relation to any averment made by him has failed to discharge that burden. No judge likes to decide cases on burden of proof if he can legitimately avoid having to do so. There are cases, however, in which, owing to the unsatisfactory state of the evidence or otherwise, deciding on the burden of proof is the only just course for him to take.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     26 In a case of the antiquity of the present one, the trial being over four years after the events in issue, it is quite understandable that the trial judge would find it impossible to come to a conclusion one way or the other.  
      
       
     27 It is also necessary to remember that the appeal is by way of rehearing: Supreme Court Act 1970 s 75A(5). It is not a trial de novo, or a trial of the case afresh on the record. The plaintiff bore the burden in the appeal not merely of showing that on the facts that his contentions might be available but of showing that the trial judge’s conclusions ought to be reversed. 
      
       
     28 One other background matter must be borne in mind. In Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319, McClelland CJ in Eq said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive (which I will compendiously describe as ‘misleading’) within the meaning of s 52 of the  
         Trade Practices Act 
          1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the  
         Fair Trading Act 
         ), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was; and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading. Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances. In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition. Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. All this is a matter of ordinary human experience. 
         
        
        
         
         Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the court, which means that the court ‘must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence’. Such satisfaction is ‘not … attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved’ including the ‘seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding’:  
         Helton v Allen 
          (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 712. 
         
        
        
         
         Considerations of the above kinds can pose serious difficulties of proof for a party relying upon spoken words as the foundation of a cause of action based on s 52 of the  
         Trade Practices Act 
          1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the  
         Fair Trading Act 
         ), in the absence of some reliable contemporaneous record or other satisfactory corroboration.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     29 Though those words were uttered in relation to a misleading conduct case, they have general application. Indeed, the present case is a case of misleading conduct though it was not pleaded as such. Here, not only was the plaintiff relying on a conversation for which there was no support in contemporaneous records and no corroboration (since, though the plaintiff’s brother-in-law was present in the shop at the time, he said he was too far away to hear the conversation), but the plaintiff was contending for a conversation, the inherent unlikelihood of which was high. In addition, the risks of misunderstanding alluded to by McClelland J were doubtless increased by the plaintiff’s lack of skill in speaking English. Parts of his evidence were given through an interpreter and the parts which were not were not of high linguistic quality. 
      
       
     30 In my opinion, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has demonstrated error in the trial judge’s failure to be satisfied that the conversation took place. As the plaintiff submitted, whether uncontradicted evidence should be accepted depends on all the circumstances, including its inherent probability and the possibility of calling evidence in reply. It was possible but it was not inherently probable. The plaintiff submitted that there was no finding that it was inherently improbable, however the trial judge’s statement that the alleged advice was “extraordinary” amounts to the same thing. 
      
       
     31 Further, the failure of the plaintiff to make speedy complaint was, at least taken with other factors, capable of weakening confidence in the vital element of the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff’s contention that his failure to confront the defendant or identify the particular employee of the defendant lacked significance because if it had had significance, persons in the position of the plaintiff would invariably fail is invalid. That factor taken with other factors is capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion in the present case. It might not in other cases, and it might not if it stood alone. In oral argument, it was pointed out on behalf of the plaintiff that after the accident he was in hospital for some time. It was also pointed out that any confrontation might have been less likely once legal advice had been sought. It was submitted that the plaintiff was of little commercial sophistication and did not have a confident command of the English language. In summary, it was submitted that to hold against the plaintiff the fact that he did not confront the defendant or its employees was an inappropriate mode of analysis. As indicated earlier, while standing alone it would not be sufficient to justify the trial judge’s reasoning, it cannot be an irrelevant mode of analysis. 
      
       
     35 The plaintiff’s complaint that the defendant should have called each of the eleven employees who appeared in court to deny having given the plaintiff the alleged advice is invalid. The plaintiff himself denied that any of them had advised him in the terms complained of. The defendant, on the strength of evidence which the trial judge accepted and which the plaintiff did not claim to have been wrongly accepted, found that there was no other relevant employee. It follows that there was no other member of staff on the plaintiff’s own evidence who could have given relevant evidence. Those circumstances meant that Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 was inapplicable. 
      
       
     36 In Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 at 201-202, Glass JA said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether the principle can or should be applied depends upon whether the conditions for its operation exist. These conditions are three in number: (a) the missing witness would be expected to be called by one party rather than the other, (b) his evidence would elucidate a particular matter, (c) his absence is unexplained. 
         
        
        
         
         ...  
         
        
        
         
         According to  
         Wigmore 
         , par 285, the second condition is fulfilled where the party or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated. Under other formulations, the condition is made out when the witness is presumably able to put a true complexion on the facts:  
         Jones v Dunkel 
          [(1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308], might have proved the contrary: ibid [(1959) 101 CLR 298 at 312]; would have a close knowledge of the facts:  
         O’Donnell v Reichard 
          [[1975] VR 916 at 921], or where it appears that he had knowledge:  
         Nuhic v Rail & Road Excavations 
          [[1972] 1 NSWLR 204 at 211]. I would think it insufficient to meet the requirements of principle that one party merely claims that the missing witness has knowledge, or that, upon the evidence, he may have knowledge. Unless, upon the evidence, the tribunal of fact is entitled to conclude that he probably would have knowledge, there would seem to be no basis for any adverse deduction from the failure to call him.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      Here, the only relevant witnesses to be called were those who, according to the plaintiff, did not speak to him. Their evidence would not have “elucidated” the facts beyond the extent to which the plaintiff had done so. The employees of the defendant who were not called are people whom the plaintiff “merely claims” to have material knowledge. The trial judge concluded that they probably would not have material knowledge. Hence there is no room for Jones v Dunkel to operate. 
      
       
     38 The truth is that the plaintiff’s denials of having been served by the eleven employees and the trial judge’s acceptance of the proposition that there were no other employees were fatal to the reliability of the plaintiff’s account and the trial judge’s statement that he was not satisfied that the relevant advice had been given may have been a polite way of cloaking a conclusion implicit in his reasoning that in fact the advice was not given. 
      
       
     39 In oral argument, it was pointed out on behalf of the plaintiff that the identification parade involved an attempt to identify a person whom the plaintiff had only ever seen once. A positive claim of a successful identification might have excited disbelief. Indeed, it was submitted that it might be enormously damaging for the plaintiff to have made such a claim. It was also submitted that when each answer to a series of questions in the form, “The gentleman who has answered the name of Stephen Butler, is he the man who gave you advice”, was “no”, the true meaning of the evidence is that the plaintiff was simply saying “I am not prepared to put my oath positively to the proposition that he is the man who gave the advice but he could have been.” It was also submitted that there was no evidence and there should have been that it was not the practice of employees of the defendant to give advice of the character complained of. 
      
       
     42 I would reject these arguments. The difficulty of identification after one encounter is no doubt a real difficulty but it was inherent in the case which the plaintiff was bringing. Once the plaintiff had denied that the persons in court had served him in the shop, there ceased to be any point in calling them. Whatever the plaintiff’s difficulties with English, on the face of the cross-examination as recorded, to say “no” does not mean “I’m not sure”. If that was what the plaintiff had intended, the matter could have been clarified in re-examination but there was no re-examination on that point. 
      
       
     43 A further submission advanced orally concerned the following passage in the reasons for judgement: 
      
       
        
         
         “The procuring of these persons to this court from Narellan for the identification parade must have been enormously disruptive of the defendant’s enterprise and given the circumstances, it can be seen as a forensic exercise in fairness to the plaintiff that led the plaintiff’s case nowhere.” 
         
        
       
     44 It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that it was wrong for the trial judge “to visit upon the plaintiff’s head” the inconvenience to the defendant of having brought those employees to the court and that the passage just set out was a veiled criticism of the plaintiff. It was further submitted that the defendant could have had photographs taken of the relevant employees and had them brought to court for the consideration of the plaintiff. Finally, it was submitted that it was wrong to describe what happened as a forensic exercise carried out in fairness to the plaintiff. 
      
       
     45 First, it seems to me that the trial judge was not criticising the plaintiff for the fact that the identification parade was held; it was not the plaintiff who had asked for it. 
      
       
     46 Secondly, whether or not the identification parade was a forensic exercise being carried out in fairness to the plaintiff does not matter. Even if the trial judge intended to say that, or even if it was a flaw in his approach to say that, it is not a flaw which is decisive and certainly not one which would justify a new trial. The Court is not able to order a new trial unless of opinion that some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been occasioned by the ground of appeal which succeeds: Supreme Court Rules Pt 51 r 23(1)(d). 
      
       
     47 The next matter dealt with in oral argument related to the trial judge’s treatment of the plaintiff’s evidence about flange changing, which was quoted above. The trial judge said that the plaintiff’s evidence was “far from convincing”. If the trial judge was intending to reject the plaintiff’s evidence on that subject, it was capable of having an impact on his credibility on other subjects and to that extent I would reject the plaintiff’s oral argument, which was that doubts about the plaintiff’s evidence in relation to the changing of flanges could not rationally affect his reliability on whether the conversation occurred. In the course of oral argument, various possibilities were floated between the bar table and the Court as to the significance of the flange evidence. Even if the trial judge committed some error in relation to the flange evidence or even if there is some obscurity in his reasoning about it, it is not sufficiently decisive in his reasoning to justify a new trial. 
      
       
     49 A further argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiff orally related to the credibility of the plaintiff’s wife, brother-in-law and cousin in relation to issues relating to what happened to the purchase docket, what happened to the grinder and what happened to the disk fragments from the disk which had shattered and injured the plaintiff. The submission advanced on behalf of the plaintiff was that if there were difficulties with the particular aspects of the evidence of those witnesses, they did not flow on to justify a rejection of the plaintiff’s evidence. A related criticism was that insufficient reasoning was exposed to justify the criticisms made by the trial judge of those witnesses. As to that latter criticism, in my opinion there was sufficient reasoning, brief though it was. The trial judge indicated that there were contradictions between the evidence of the witnesses (as there were) and indicated other weaknesses in it.  
      
       
     50 It is not clear whether the trial judge intended his criticisms of those witnesses to flow on to his evaluation of the plaintiff. There was unquestionably an important relationship between the plaintiff’s evidence and their evidence. Some of the difficulties in the plaintiff’s case were that there was no corroboration for the vital conversation, that there was no documentary proof of purchase from the defendant and that the absence of the grinder meant that it was not possible to test those parts of the plaintiff’s testimony that were related to the grinder. 
      
       
     51 The calling of those witnesses was a decision taken by the plaintiff’s advisers in order to explain the lack of some of those vital ingredients. The task committed to those witnesses was a task which they failed satisfactorily to perform. To the extent that the trial judge took this into account in rejecting the plaintiff’s case as a whole he was entitled to. If on the narrower question of the plaintiff’s personal credibility the trial judge is said wrongly to have used the evidence of the others to reject the plaintiff’s evidence, the answer is that the trial judge did not reject the plaintiff’s evidence but merely found himself unable either to accept or to reject it. In coming to that conclusion, the trial judge was entitled to take into account the evidence of the other witnesses called on behalf of the plaintiff.  
      
       
     52 The plaintiff’s submission that in all the circumstances the trial judge failed to use or palpably misused his advantage in having seen the witnesses is invalid. That contention is not supported by the transcript record of the trial, nor is it supported by the reasons for judgment. Delivered as they were very soon after the trial judge heard the evidence, they reveal a sound grip on the central elements of the evidence. Nor are the particular matters relied on in oral argument concerning the failure to complain, the identification parade and the failure to call employees sufficient to support the argument.

    1 His Honour: The prisoner “T” was arraigned before a jury on a count of murdering David Laxale on 24 February 1997. He pleaded not guilty to that charge but on 9 November 2001 he was convicted and is now to be sentenced for that offence. 
    2 It is the second time that the prisoner has been convicted of this murder. After a trial by jury in 1999, Justice Hidden sentenced the prisoner on 25 June of that year to 15 years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 11 years and an additional term of 4 years. That sentence commenced on 23 March 1997, the date upon which the prisoner had been arrested for the offence. However, on 28 May 2001 this sentence was set aside when the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed an appeal against the prisoner’s conviction and ordered that there be a re-trial, see R v Tang [2001] NSWCCA 210. It was the retrial that was conducted before me. 
    3 There is a convention that, where a sentence is to be imposed upon a prisoner following a re-trial after a successful appeal, the sentence should not ordinarily be greater than that imposed by the original sentencing judge. The policy considerations underlying that convention and the principles operating in respect of it have been most recently considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Merritt [2000] NSWCCA 365. It is enough for the moment to note that the policy behind this practice is a concern that an accused should not find himself in a worse position as a consequence of a successful appeal. In the present case the Crown has submitted that, applying the principles set out in Merritt, I should impose a more severe sentence upon the prisoner than that imposed by Justice Hidden. I shall return to the arguments in support of that contention and the considerations they raise later in these remarks. 
    4 The facts in the matter can be stated briefly. There is, in light of the jury’s verdict, little need or justification for me to find facts apart from one matter; that is the extent of the injuries inflicted by the prisoner upon the deceased. I do not believe that this matter is of crucial importance in the sentencing of the prisoner but it was a matter that was the subject of considerable debate between the parties during the sentencing hearing. 
    5 The jury’s verdict meant that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the stab wounds inflicted by the prisoner at least substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. It does not seem to me in this particular case to be a significant matter whether some other person may have also inflicted a wound that might have led to the death of the deceased. The prisoner has been found by the jury to have been responsible for the death of Mr Laxale to the extent that he should be held to have murdered him. There is no doubt that the jury must have found that the prisoner inflicted more than one fatal wound and his criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased is substantial regardless of the acts of any other person which contributed to the death of the deceased. 
    6 However, I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence in the trial and the issues left to the jury by me in the summing up, that the verdict should be taken to mean that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner inflicted all of the deceased’s wounds. In any event, for reasons, which I will give shortly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did inflict all fatal injuries suffered by the deceased. 
    7 The stabbing of the deceased arose in circumstances where the prisoner and three other young men, “JI”, “AM” and “LS”, were involved in the theft of mangoes from a tree growing in the yard of the deceased’s property. The four young men were wandering aimlessly around the streets of Berala, a Sydney suburb, when they saw the mangoes. The prisoner entered the yard and commenced to pick fruit which he then threw to the others in the street. The deceased interrupted the activity and took hold of “AM”. A struggle ensued and when the deceased appeared to be having the best of this altercation, the prisoner went to “AM’s” assistance in order to secure his release. “AM” made good his escape but the prisoner and the deceased were then involved in a fight. I believe that it was at this time that the prisoner stabbed the deceased. The other three young men then joined in the attack upon the deceased repeatedly punching and kicking him. When a neighbour called out, the four ran away leaving the deceased mortally wounded. He died a short time later despite the attempts of ambulance officers to assist him. 
    8 The evidence, upon which the Crown chiefly relied to identify the prisoner as the person who stabbed the deceased, was that of “JI”. It was his testimony, that shortly after the fight, when the four men were cleaning themselves at a tap, he saw the prisoner with a bloody knife and heard him admit to having stabbed the deceased three times. There were in fact seven wounds inflicted upon the deceased and the evidence was that there were four fatal wounds, that is four wounds any one of which could have caused the death of the deceased. The real issue at the trial was whether it was the prisoner who was responsible for any or all of those wounds. 
    9 “I” had admitted during the trial before Justice Hidden that he was in possession of a knife at the time of the stabbing and this led to a substantial attack upon his evidence in the trial before me principally on the basis that it was he and not the prisoner who had stabbed the deceased. However, the Crown submitted to the jury that they would find that the prisoner had inflicted at least two of the fatal wounds, those being two of the three wounds to the deceased’s back. The Crown case was left to the jury on the basis that they would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those wounds substantially contributed to the death of the deceased and that the prisoner was guilty of murder even if “JI” had inflicted the other fatal stab wounds. 
    10 The prisoner gave evidence that he saw “JI” stabbing the deceased during the fight and it was he, not the prisoner, who was in possession of a bloody knife at the tap. The prisoner denied ever having admitted stabbing the deceased or having a knife except when he took the bloody knife from “JI” and washed it. The prisoner acknowledged that he had attacked the deceased in order to assist “AM” but said that he was then himself struck over the head by the deceased which blow caused him to fall to the ground dazed. It was at this time that he saw the other three men fighting with the deceased and witnessed “JI” stabbing him. The prisoner then re-entered the affray punching and kicking the deceased with the others. 
    11 It is obvious that the jury concluded that the account given by the prisoner in the witness box could not possibly be true. In light of the fact that he did not give that version until after he had lodged an appeal against his conviction before Justice Hidden, it is not surprising that the jury concluded that it should be rejected. The version was not even totally consistent with an account the prisoner gave in an affidavit placed before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Consistently with the jury’s verdict but on my own assessment of the evidence, I also conclude that the version was completely untrue and should be disregarded for any purpose in sentencing the prisoner. 
    12 There was a strong attack made upon the reliability of the evidence of “JI” during the course of the trial. Much of the criticism of his evidence was completely justified. Not only had he been involved in the attack upon the deceased, but he had also received a sentencing discount for the offence to which he pleaded guilty arising from that attack on the basis that he would give evidence against the prisoner. There were numerous and significant inconsistencies in his various accounts and his conduct after the stabbing was consistent with his having played a more serious role in the attack than he was willing to admit. Even the Crown was prepared to accept the possibility that “JI” was not telling the jury the complete truth when he denied that he was responsible for inflicting any of the stab wounds upon the deceased.  
    13 But at the end of the day I am satisfied that the jury must have accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the account given by “JI” was substantially true and that the prisoner was holding a knife covered in blood after the fight when he admitted to having stabbed the deceased. Mr Cook, who appeared for the prisoner at the trial, submitted to the jury that, if there was any possibility that “JI” may have inflicted stab wounds to the deceased, then they could not accept him as a witness of truth and as a result they should reject his evidence and acquit the prisoner. I instructed the jury in similar terms despite the Crown’s opposition. It follows that by their verdict, the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that “JI” did not stab the deceased. I would, myself, independently come to the same conclusion. 
    14 “JI”, for all his faults as an historian and the patent inconsistencies in his evidence, seemed to me to have been the only one of the four men involved in the fight who was attempting to be a truthful witness. I would come to this view even if I were to disregard the patently false evidence of the prisoner. The jury must have come to the same conclusion about “JI’s” credibility. It is hard to identify what it was about his evidence that made it so convincing despite the criticisms made of it and I acknowledge that, if an assessment of his evidence were confined to what is contained in the transcript, one would be well justified in dismissing it as unreliable. 
    15 However, his credibility was assisted by a piece of evidence that on its face seemed highly improbable but which ultimately was supported by objective facts. This was “JI’s” account of the prisoner making a telephone call shortly after the fight and during that call making statements that could amount to an admission that he had stabbed the deceased. “JI” had never mentioned this phone call before giving evidence before me. But by the end of the trial there was uncontroverted evidence that within minutes of the stabbing a call was made on the prisoner’s mobile phone to the home of a friend called Manunu. The prisoner was never able to satisfactorily explain why he made that call at that time. It was well open to the jury to find this piece of evidence strongly supportive of “JI’s” account and damning of the prisoner. 
    16 But even without this evidence, I would have accepted “JI’s” version of the fight and what occurred after it. I find the fact that at the first trial “JI” was prepared to volunteer that he had a knife in his possession to be highly significant in an assessment of the truthfulness of his evidence. If he had been giving false testimony against the prisoner, there was every reason why he should have simply denied that he had a knife when asked that question by the Crown Prosecutor. There was nothing that would have contradicted that denial. Before he made that admission, there had been no real suggestion that it was he, rather than any other of the four, who had stabbed the deceased. The prisoner had stated that he knew nothing about the stabbing and had never implicated “JI”. If “JI” had stabbed the deceased and was lying about the events of the night to cover his own guilt, then I simply cannot understand why he would admit having a knife in his possession. 
    17 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner was responsible for each of the stab wounds inflicted upon the deceased. This was, I note, the basis upon which Justice Hidden sentenced the prisoner. The Crown submitted that if I made such a finding then it would follow that I must conclude that the prisoner inflicted the stab wounds with an intention to kill the deceased, such were the number and seriousness of the wounds. That was not the finding made by Justice Hidden who sentenced the prisoner on the basis of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
    18 Although the number and extent of the injuries are important aspects in determining the intention with which they were inflicted they are not decisive. The injuries have to be considered in the context of the whole of the circumstances surrounding their infliction. In the present case the prisoner was a 17-year-old youth who had no prior offences for violence and who, quite unexpectedly, became involved in a fight with a bigger and stronger man. There is nothing to suggest that, although the prisoner was carrying a knife at the time, he or the other young men were looking to become involved in an attack upon any member of the public on this particular night. The incident arose spontaneously without warning. The prisoner is a man of small and slight stature as was “AM”. At the time of the stabbing the prisoner was engaged in fighting the deceased by himself and the deceased was intent on apprehending at least one of the persons whom he found stealing the mangoes. 
    19 None of these facts in anyway suggests that there was the slightest justification for the prisoner assaulting the deceased, let alone stabbing him. I am simply indicating that the number and nature of the stab wounds do not of themselves in all the circumstances of this matter compel a finding that the prisoner intended to kill the deceased. I am not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had that intention. 
    20 However, this finding does not mean that the offence was not a serious one. The use of a potentially lethal weapon against an unarmed person is unfortunately an all too frequent occurrence in our society and was so at the time of the offence. It is also notorious that young men go about the streets armed with lethal weapons without any warrant for doing so. If a person is armed with a weapon capable of inflicting serious injury or death then it can be presumed that the person intends to use it if the need arises. There is a real risk that the weapon will be used even though there is not the slightest possible justification for it being produced. That was what happened in the present case. 
    21 The prisoner gave evidence that the deceased grabbed him around the throat and struck him a blow to the head that caused him to fall to the ground stunned. I have been informed that he gave a somewhat similar account in an interview with police shortly after his arrest. That interview was in evidence at the first trial but not tendered before me. Justice Hidden referred to the fact that the deceased struck the prisoner in his sentencing remarks. However, I am not prepared to make that finding. I have already indicated that I am not prepared to act upon the account given by the prisoner in evidence before me. It is inconsistent with the evidence of the other young men, particularly “AM”, as to what the prisoner was doing when he and the other two entered the attack upon the deceased. In any event, the fact that the deceased may have struck the prisoner during their altercation is in no way mitigating of the prisoner’s attack upon him with a knife with an intention of causing him grievous bodily harm. 
    22 In my view this is a serious case of murder by reason of the circumstances in which the prisoner came to stab the deceased, the use of a knife on an unarmed member of the public who was simply protecting his property and the number and nature of the wounds. This is clearly a case where general deterrence should play a significant part in the sentence to be imposed to deter other young men from carrying and producing lethal weapons in public places. Since the commission of the offence the legislature has increased the number of offences and the penalties applicable to the carrying and use of knives in public. But I do not see that this consideration or any other matter subjective to the prisoner or arising from the facts would diminish the importance of the sentence to be imposed reflecting a significant degree of general deterrence.  
    23 The prisoner was at the time of the killing of Mr Laxale, and is still, a young man. When he was sentenced by Justice Hidden, it was erroneously believed that he was 18 years of age at the time of the killing. In fact he was 17 years and 4 months. This error was at the heart of the successful appeal against conviction because it had an impact upon the admissibility of statements made by the prisoner to investigating police. But the error has little or no impact on the assessment of the sentence that he should serve. The simple fact is that he was a young man at the time of the killing and I do not believe there is any significance in the fact that Justice Hidden sentenced him on the basis that he was an adult so far as the law was concerned. It was faintly argued by Mr Cook that the prisoner should receive some consideration by reason of the fact that, had his true age been known by the authorities, he would have served his remand period in a juvenile institution rather than an adult gaol. That fact might have had some significance if the question before me was whether the prisoner should be sentenced to prison for a relatively minor offence. But it can hardly be a relevant matter when consideration is being given to a sentence for a serious case of murder. 
    24 The prisoner was born in Cambodia in October 1979. He left his homeland in 1985 with his mother and older siblings in order to escape the Pol Pot regime. His father was apparently a victim of the atrocities committed by that administration. His mother found it difficult to adjust to life in this country but, as best she could, she provided a sound upbringing for the prisoner. Unfortunately, at the time of the killing the prisoner had been estranged from his mother for many years principally as a result of language and emotional difficulties. It appears that since his imprisonment he has re-established a close relationship with his mother and family members. 
    25 There are a number of testimonials before me attesting to the good character and stable background of the prisoner. That material and the reports from psychologists indicate that the offence committed was out of character. It is also said that the prisoner is deeply remorseful of his involvement in the incident although there is little weight to be placed upon that matter in light of his denials of guilt. He has been supported since his arrest by an organisation known as the Karuna Foundation and members of this group have visited him while he has been in custody. He also has the support of members of his family. 
    26 Not surprisingly the prisoner has not found it easy to adapt to prison life during the period of custody since he was sentenced by Hidden J. He has suffered periods of depression. There is information before me to suggest that the prisoner has been the victim of attacks by other prisoners. The prisoner appears to have fallen out with a group of aboriginal youths and one confrontation with them resulted in the prisoner suffering significant injuries himself. Unfortunately violence suffered by one prisoner at the hands of others is frequently part of the experience of life in gaol in this State. The prisoner did not give evidence before me about the circumstances in which he has been the subject of violence. However, there are reports from the gaol in evidence before me that suggest that violence involving the prisoner has not been all one way and that he has been part of a group engaged in attacks upon other prisoners. But I know little about the circumstances in which these incidents have occurred and I can place no weight upon them. However, the fact that the prisoner has been injured in prison and holds fears for his safety is not a matter to which I can attach significant weight when sentencing him for an offence as serious as that before me. 
    27 The prisoner’s general health has also been affected during his period in custody and he has been greatly concerned and distressed by this fact. Unfortunately this is not an infrequent result of a period in gaol and, again, it is not a matter that can be given great weight when sentencing him for an offence of murder. 
    28 I have received in evidence a victim impact statement written by the deceased’s wife as to the effect of the death of Mr Laxale on her and their children. That statement was not admitted for the purpose of increasing the sentence of the prisoner and has not been used by me in any way to aggravate the severity of his crime. But the reception of such evidence permits the family of the deceased to participate in the proceedings by expressing their grief and loss as a result of his death. It reminds the court, if it is necessary to do so, of the real human tragedy involved in matters that come before it. I understand that it is particularly difficult to come to grips with the death of a treasured family member when it occurs so pointlessly and unexpectedly as it did on this occasion. The court takes this opportunity to express its sympathy and understanding to Mr Laxale’s family and friends. 
    29 Having regard to the material before me and to other sentences to which I have been referred by the Crown, I believe that a sentence in excess of that imposed by Justice Hidden would be necessary to meet the objective seriousness of the offence notwithstanding the prisoner’s age and antecedents. Clearly, by reason of his youth and the time he must spend in custody as punishment for what he has done, the prisoner will need some assistance when released. However, there does not appear to be any significant matter that needs to be addressed of a psychological or psychiatric nature. I have difficulty seeing any factor that would amount to special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period notwithstanding the prisoner’s age, his lack of relevant antecedents and taking into account that he is serving his first period in custody. 
    30 However, it is not the case that, simply because I would have imposed a more severe sentence on the prisoner than that imposed by Hidden J, I should consider myself free to impose that sentence. The convention or practice, to which I referred at the outset of these remarks, exists because a sentencing judge might not agree with the sentence originally imposed and yet policy dictates that the sentence should not be increased. In the present case there is nothing in the facts as found by me or the evidence before me which would itself justify my varying the sentence imposed by Justice Hidden. The only basis upon which I could increase that sentence was if I were justified in coming to the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate so as to warrant intervention by the Court of Criminal Appeal; Merritt at [34]. 
    31 In the present case there was no Crown appeal lodged in respect of the sentence imposed by Hidden J. I accept that there may be discretionary reasons that would explain the failure of the Crown to appeal notwithstanding that it held the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. But the failure of the Crown to appeal a sentence which it now says is so lenient as to manifest error by the sentencing judge, is a matter which causes me to exercise considerable caution before determining that a sentence imposed by another justice of this Court is so inadequate that the Court of Criminal Appeal would have intervened had the Crown in fact appealed. 
    32 I have expressed the view that the sentence imposed by Hidden J is not the sentence I would have imposed had this been the first time that the prisoner had been convicted of this offence. But I am not satisfied that the sentence was so lenient as to be erroneous having regard to the prisoner’s age and antecedents and the circumstances of the offence. It is trite to observe that, generally speaking, there is a range of sentences that would be appropriate for a particular offence committed by a particular offender. I believe that the sentence imposed by Hidden J is at the very bottom of that range but I am not satisfied that it falls outside it. The fact that the sentence I would have imposed would also fall within that range but nearer the top end of it does not justify my now imposing that sentence where there is no appreciable difference between the facts which were before Hidden J and those which are before me. 
    33 Further, I believe that there are considerations that militate against increasing the sentence even if it were otherwise appropriate to do so. These are chiefly the prisoner’s age, the stress of having to stand trial twice for murder for reasons that were not of the prisoner’s making, the effects of imprisonment upon him and the period of uncertainty for the prisoner which attended the two trials. However, in my view the prisoner can regard himself as fortunate indeed when consideration is given to sentences imposed by judges of this Court upon other young men for somewhat similar offences. 
    34 Therefore, the prisoner is sentenced to 15 years imprisonment commencing on 23 March 1997 with a non-parole period of 11 years dating from the same date and expiring on 22 March 2008 the date he is eligible to be considered for release to parole.

       The Respondent was sentenced in the District Court for six offences to which he had entered a plea of guilty. The offences were four counts of armed robbery, one count of assault with intent to rob when armed with an offensive weapon and one count of use of an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. Two other offences – one of armed robbery, the other, assault – were also taken into account. The District Court judge sentenced the Respondent to a total of six years with a non-parole period of three years, commencing from the date of arrest.  
        
        
       The Crown appealed against the sentences, claiming that they were manifestly inadequate and that the District Court judge had failed to give adequate weight to the aggravating factor that the offences were committed while the offender was on parole.

       The District Court judge failed to give consideration to the fact that the offences were committed while the Respondent was on parole. This constituted an error of law in the sentencing process.

       Manifest inadequacy 
        
       The sentences imposed gave insufficient weight to the gravity of the offences, including considerations of the vulnerability of the victims and the terror occasioned by the threat of a syringe. The District Court judge gave excessive weight to the subjective case of the Respondent. The sentence was manifestly inadequate.

       The Respondent did not present significant evidence of progress in rehabilitation to reduce the effect of the gravity of the offences, the Respondent’s long criminal record and the commission of the offences while on parole.  
        
        
       All offenders should be sentenced according to the same principles The Aboriginality of an offender operates to highlight mitigating factors which may occur more frequently in some groups than others. The Respondent presented a common history of deprivation leading to drug abuse.  
        
        
       The sentences should not commence from the date of arrest but from the conclusion of the sentence for which the Respondent was on parole when he committed the offences. The sentences should be made partially concurrent sentences to reflect the overall criminality of the conduct.

      REGINA v Stanley John FERNANDO 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Respondent, Stanley John Fernando, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six offences and was committed for sentence to the District Court under s51A of the Justices Act. There were four counts of armed robbery contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed respectively on 30 July, 1 August, 8 August and 16 August 2000. There was one count of assault with intent to rob when armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which occurred on 9 August 2000. The maximum penalty for each of these offences was twenty years imprisonment. The sixth count was a charge of attempting to use an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension contrary to s33B(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which occurred on 22 August 2000. 
      
       
     2 The Respondent adhered to his pleas of guilty in the District Court and was sentenced by Moore DCJ in Dubbo on 15 March 2001. His Honour imposed a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years for the offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. For each of the other five offences his Honour imposed a term of six years with a non-parole period of three years. All of the sentences took effect from 22 August 2000, the date on which the Respondent was arrested. His Honour was informed that on 4 December 2000 the Respondent had been sentenced in the Local Court to a term of imprisonment of twelve months, with a non-parole period of nine months, for an offence of taking and driving a conveyance and that that sentence took effect from 22 August 2000. 
      
       
     3 The first offence in chronological sequence occurred at about 12.45pm on Sunday 30 July 2000. The Respondent entered the premises of the Ashwood Country Club in Waylandra Street, Dubbo. He had been driven to that location by a co-offender who waited outside in the vehicle. The Respondent’s fingerprints were identified in that vehicle. In the reception area of the motel the Respondent brandished a syringe filled with a red coloured liquid at the victim, a Mr Ronald Seidlitz, and said, “Give me the money or I’ll stick you in the face”. Mr Seidlitz handed the Respondent a cash tin containing $340. 
      
       
     4 The second offence occurred two days later on Tuesday 1 August at about 8.15am when the Respondent and a co-offender, Bianca Byrnes, entered the Dubbo RSL Resort Motel foyer. The Respondent was again armed with a syringe filled with a red liquid and demanded money saying “Where’s your cash bag where’s the rest of the money”. The victim, Kylie Tighe, handed the Respondent a cash tin containing $1,322. 
      
       
     5 The third offence occurred at about 9.45am on Tuesday 8 August 2000. The Respondent and an unidentified co-offender attended the premises of the West Dubbo Post Office in Victoria Street, Dubbo. He again produced a syringe filled with red liquid. He demanded cash. The Respondent lent over the counter placing his palm on the centre of the counter from which a fingerprint was later developed and identified as his. He removed $850 from the drawer behind the counter. 
      
       
     6 The fourth offence occurred at 2pm on Wednesday 9 August 2000. Mr Barry Trollope was behind the reception counter at the Endeavour Court Motel in Bourke Street, Dubbo. The Respondent presented a syringe filled with a red liquid. Mr Trollope locked himself out of the reception area. The Respondent attempted to open a number of closed doors. The Respondent left the reception area without obtaining any money. He was later identified through computer images by Mr Trollope. (Although actually an attempt, I will hereafter include this incident in my references to “armed robbery offences”.) 
      
       
     7 The fifth armed robbery offence occurred at about 3.30pm on Wednesday 16 August 2000. The Respondent went to the premises of Jeans West in Orange City Centre. He was again in possession of a syringe filled with a red liquid. He approached Sandra Maguire, an employee of Jeans West, was who working alone. He pointed the syringe at Sandra Maguire and said it was filled with Hepatitis C. He threatened to stab her unless she handed him money from the cash register. The cash register was locked and Ms Maguire was unable to locate the key. The Respondent became agitated and continued to threaten her with the syringe. He escorted her into a back room where she eventually located the keys and opened the cash register. The Respondent threatened Ms Maguire’s life. He took $385 and left the store. 
      
       
     8 The sixth offence occurred at the time of his arrest. The Court was informed that warrants had been issued against him for failing to appear, for revocation of parole and for armed robbery. At about 2pm on Tuesday 22 August 2000 he was seen by police outside premises at the intersection of Armstrong Crescent and Collins Avenue, Dubbo. When Constable McLaughlin attempted to arrest him, the Respondent took hold of the Constable’s service pistol and released the holster clasp. He pulled the pistol out of the holster to the stage where the trigger had cleared the holster. Constable McLaughlin then attempted to force the pistol back into the holster by pushing down on the Respondent’s hands. The Respondent shouted “Let me fucking go, I’ve got your gun, I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you”. Constable McLaughlin feared for his life and began to shout for help. He also struck the Respondent. The Respondent then took hold of Constable McLaughlin by the throat with both of his hands. The Constable was unable to breathe and kicked the Respondent twice. Shortly afterwards another constable and a male civilian came to the assistance of Constable McLaughlin. The Respondent was forced to the ground and handcuffed. Constable McLaughlin received bruising to his throat and neck area and an abrasion to the back of his right hand. 
      
       
     9 His Honour was asked to take into account two other offences under s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. First, was an armed robbery which had occurred at about 8.30pm on 1 May 1999 in Yaruga Street, Dubbo. The Respondent and a female accomplice were in a taxi when the Respondent produced a syringe with which he menaced the taxi driver. He demanded money and took $260 and the money clip. 
      
       
     10 The second matter to be taken into account on the Form 1 occurred on 23 August 2000 at Dubbo Police Station. A registered nurse employed by the Department of Corrective Services in Dubbo was standing in his clinic adjacent to the cell doors when the Respondent abused him and spat at him. This was the act that constituted the assault. Subsequently the nurse had direct contact with the Respondent during which he threatened him and, as a result of which, the nurse feared for his safety and the safety of his family. 
      
       
     11 At the commencement of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour made reference to both of the matters contained in the respective Forms 1, and said that these matters are “considered in the assessment of the total sentence”. Pursuant to s33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the offences listed on a Forms 1 may be taken into account “in dealing with the offender for the principal offence”. In the present case the Crown did not attempt to link the matters on the Form 1 to any specific offence. Nor does his Honour seem to do so in his Remarks. However, no complaint is made in this regard.  
      
       
     12 On the day of his arrest the Respondent was taken to Dubbo Police Station. He consulted a representative of the Western Aboriginal Legal Service, who advised him not to make any admissions. When asked, at about 4.35pm on the afternoon of his arrest, whether he wished to answer any questions, he said that on the basis of legal advice he would not. An hour later he approached an officer and said “I want to tell them the truth. I want to be interviewed about it and get it out of the way”. A person described as the Responent’s girlfriend, Ms Rebecca MacMillan, was contacted and brought to the police station as a support person for him. He informed the officers “I want to get everything cleared up. Rebecca and I decided that it would be that best way”. He subsequently made a full admission as to the matters about which he was interviewed which led to the charges, save in one case about which the police did not ask questions, but with respect to which he did plead guilty.  
      
       
     13 In the course of a record of interview about the respective incidents, the Respondent answered police questions about why he had changed his mind, after initially accepting the advice he had received. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The reason was that I just wanted to get these charges over and done with and I just want to try to get out and straighten stuff out and that cause I’m using heroin and that. I just want to get it all over and done with and try not to muck the court around too much, just get it over and done with. That’s the main thing.” 
         
        
       
     14 As his Honour concluded, the Respondent pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and adhered to that plea. He was accordingly entitled to a substantial discount for the plea which his Honour computed at 20% in the case of the armed robbery offences and 10% in the case of the using offensive weapon to prevent arrest offence. The Crown makes no complaint in this regard.  
      
       
     15 His Honour said that the case against the Respondent with respect to the armed robberies varied in strength from one incident to another. His Honour said that the Respondent’s immediate admission occurred in a context in which with respect to a number of the offences the Crown case could not, at that stage of the investigations, be described as strong. His Honour indicated that the case with regard to using an offensive weapon charge was a strong one. His Honour did not, in this respect, distinguish the different matters that may be reflected in a plea. 
      
       
     16 Nothing in his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence suggests that he underestimated the objective gravity of the series of offences committed over a short period. His Honour referred to the armed robbery charges in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “”In each case the offence was committed on a vulnerable individual person in a small business and a weapon was used, namely a syringe, which was filled with red liquid. The red liquid was in fact harmless but gave the appearance of blood and in each case, even when not specifically stated, I would assume that the victim was terrified, especially in the town the size of Dubbo where a number of offences of a very similar nature were committed all within less than three weeks … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         In each case of the armed robberies, the person in the shop, club, motel and post office which was robbed was alone and produced such money as was available, relatively small amounts although not inconsiderable amounts varying from $100 to different figures up to $1,092.” 
         
        
       
     17 His Honour indicated the gravity of the armed robbery offences when he referred to the terror which must have been suffered by the victims when confronted with a person wielding a syringe which appeared to be filled with blood. His Honour specifically stated that the effect on the victims was “a very serious occurrence which I take into account very much in weighing the sentence”. This Court has said on a number of occasions that the use of a syringe apparently filled with blood is a particularly serious factor because of the terror and revulsion it causes in the victims. (See e.g. R v Stone (1995) 85 ACrimR 434 at 439; R v Kyroglu and Tsoukatos [1999] NSWCCA 106 at [88].) 
      
       
     18 In the case of the charge of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, his Honour described this offence as “an extremely serious matter”. He outlined in his Remarks on Sentence the circumstances in which Constable McLaughlin tried to arrest the Respondent. His Honour made reference to the attempt to pull out the constable’s service pistol, his threat to kill the constable and the act of grabbing the constable by the throat with both hands.  
      
       
     19 His Honour was required to balance the objective circumstances of the offences, which he described as “grave”, against the subjective features of the case. In that regard his Honour referred to the vicious circle of depravation, drug addiction and offending in which the Respondent, like so many other Aboriginal youths, appears to have become trapped. 
      
       
     20 The present Respondent’s personal history had culminated in an addiction to heroin which in turn led him to commit the armed robberies in order to pay for the addiction. His Honour noted that the Respondent was young when first introduced to heroin and at that stage already had a substantial record of offending.  
      
       
     21 The record commences at the age of fourteen at Bidura Children’s Court when he was convicted of three counts of armed robbery in company. Thereafter there are numerous convictions for theft of various kinds, malicious damage, assault (including of police), escaping from custody. As a juvenile he was subject to numerous control orders. In August and October 1998 the Wyong Children’s Court sentenced him to imprisonment to be served in an adult prison for offences of assault, malicious damage and malicious wounding. 
      
       
     22 His Honour imposed the same sentence for each of the armed robbery offences. In my view he was entitled to do so. There was little to differentiate one offence from another. His Honour’s starting point was four years but, by reason of the commission of multiple offences, he increased that to six years in each case, applying the principle of “totality” as his Honour interpreted it. 
      
       
     23 The sentencing Judge referred to this Court’s guideline judgment for sentencing for armed robbery R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 as a starting point. In this Court, the submissions of both the Crown and the Respondent proceeded on the basis that the guideline in that case represented an appropriate starting point for the determination of the appropriate sentence. There was no submission that the decision of the High Court in Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64, impinged on the authority of that judgment. 
      
       
     24 In Henry the Court noted a list of characteristics which frequently recur with respect to armed robbery offences, and in cases of that character, identified a starting point of four to five years as a guide for sentencing judges. Aggravating and mitigating factors would justify a sentence below or above the narrow range of four to five years identified as a starting point (see at [161]-[170]). His Honour noted that in the subsequent decision in R v Thompson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [161], this Court clarified that Henry was based on a late guilty plea which was of limited value. In the present case his Honour indicated that he would give a discount of 20% for the armed robbery offences. This was in accordance with the significance of the matters reflected in the plea in the present case. (See Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 at [11].) 
      
       
     25 His Honour referred to the Henry characteristic in the common case of a guilty plea qualified by a strong Crown case. His Honour expressed the opinion that, save with respect to one of the offences, the Crown case in the present proceedings was not strong. In this regard his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that the police investigations had barely commenced. A number of witnesses who could have identified the Respondent had not then been asked to do so. Nor had any searches occurred for the distinctive clothing which had been identified. No doubt other investigations would have been pursued. Nevertheless, the significant value of the early admissions in the present case is highlighted by the fact that investigations of the character to which I have referred were not required. This element of assistance to the authorities together with “willingness to facilitate the course of justice” was properly considered to be material. (See Cameron v The Queen supra at [11]-[14].) 
      
       
     26 His Honour noted one distinction between this case and the characteristics of the common case identified in Henry which was an aggravating feature. Henry was based on an offender with little or no criminal history. The Respondent in this case had an extensive criminal history. 
      
       
     27 His Honour referred to the Respondent’s deprived life. He referred to the fact that the Respondent was sent to an institution for young Aboriginal men, Euabalong, which, according to the submission before the sentencing judge, which he accepted as fact, had been the subject of allegations that young men had been sexually abused. His Honour referred to the evidence of the Respondent had given to the effect that something had happened to himself when he was at Euabalong which his Honour said: “He cannot bring himself to specify”. His Honour accepted that the Respondent believed that what had happened to him at Euabalong had “destroyed his life” by commencing a process of smoking marijuana and eventually developing an addiction to heroin at the age of fifteen. The suggestion in the evidence, not expressed as such nor the subject of any finding by Moore DCJ, is that the Respondent had been subject to sexual abuse at Euabalong and that this constituted the cause of his later addiction and continued offending. 
      
       
     28 His Honour referred to the Respondent’s drug addiction as a material factor but not as constituting an excuse for the commission of armed robbery. His Honour referred to the observations of Wood CJ at CL in Henry at [273](c)(ii) where his Honour stated that drug addiction may be a relevant subjective circumstance to be taken into account when determining the appropriate sentence where, by reason of the fact that addiction occurred at a very young age, the ability of the person to “exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete”. 
      
       
     29 His Honour described the evidence given by the Respondent to the effect that something had occurred to him whilst he was at Euabalong as a “brave statement” and expressed the hope that if that matter could be dealt with in some manner then “it may well lead to his resolution, of his drug problem in due course, that will be a long road however. He has gone through at least the initial stages of rehabilitation whilst in gaol this time”.  
      
       
     30 In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour referred to the fact that the Respondent had been sentenced in the Dubbo Local Court to a term of imprisonment of twelve months with a non-parole period of nine months, commencing on 22 August. This was for an offence of driving a conveyance taken without consent of the owner.  
      
       
     31 His Honour said that this offence “pales into insignificance” when compared with the matters before him. His Honour concluded that if the matter had fallen to be sentenced together with the offences before him then all sentences would have been made concurrent. It does not appear from the record what, if any, information his Honour had about the offence for which the Respondent had been sentenced in the Local Court and whether or not it constituted, in some manner, part of the same conduct.  
      
       
     32 An appeal to this Court under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is subject to the well known and well established limitations on an appellate court interfering with the exercise of a discretion. The Crown’s case was that the sentences actually imposed were manifestly inadequate. It also submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the aggravating circumstance that the offences were committed while the Respondent was on parole. 
      
       
     33 The Crown submitted that the sentences did not reflect the objective seriousness of each offence. The Crown relied on the aggravating circumstances in which the offences were committed. First the Respondent was on parole. The sentencing judge was informed of this fact. Secondly, the offences were committed while the Respondent was on bail for the offence eventually dealt with in the Local Court. His Honour said that this second factor was an aggravating circumstance. He did not refer to the first matter. The Crown submitted that the failure to take into account the fact that the offences were committed on parole constituted a legal error. 
      
       
     34 The Respondent submits that in a case in which the Crown points to manifest inadequacy as the ground of appeal, this Court must be satisfied that the sentence actually imposed is so markedly inadequate that it must have involved a misapplication of principle, even though the precise error may not be apparent from the Remarks on Sentence. I accept these submissions.  
      
       
     35 In the present case his Honour indicated that he regarded the offences as very serious ones. However, he gave significant weight to the subjective circumstances of the Respondent. If an error of principle has occurred it is likely to have occurred either because of his Honour’s failure to give weight to the fact that the offences were committed whilst the Respondent was on parole or because he failed to give adequate weight to the objective circumstances of the offence and gave excessive weight to the subjective circumstances which his Honour identified. 
      
       
     36 The Respondent submitted that the sentences were within the permissible range of judicial discretion in all of the circumstances of the case. The Respondent relied generally on the factors identified by his Honour in his remarks on sentence, to most of which I have referred above. It was submitted that, when his Honour adjusted the sentences to reflect considerations of totality i.e. six years, the Respondent accepted that the sentences were “lenient”, but still fell within the bounds of his Honour’s sentencing discretion in all of the circumstances of the case. The Respondent submitted that if the Court decided that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, consideration should be given to exercise its residual discretion not to intervene, generally by reason of the matters to which Judge Moore had referred. 
      
       
     37 The Respondent submitted that notwithstanding his Honour’s failure to refer to the fact that the offences occurred whilst on parole he must have done so. His Honour had noted the fact that the offence had been committed on bail as an aggravating circumstance. 
      
       
     38 On 29 July 1999 in the Dubbo Local Court the Respondent had been sentenced to a number of terms of imprisonment for offences including malicious damage, break and enter with intent, three counts of break, enter and steal and intimidating a police officer. With respect to the malicious damage count, he was sentenced to a minimum term of ten months and an additional term of six months. It appears that all of the offences for which he was sentenced in the present proceedings occurred during the course of the additional term, when he had been released into the community on conditional liberty.  
      
       
     39 His Honour did not refer to this fact in his remarks on evidence. In contrast, he did refer to the fact that the offence was committed on bail. In my opinion, he overlooked this consideration. His failure to take this matter into account is a relevant legal error permitting this Court to intervene. 
      
       
     40 In a case involving an offender who committed offences whilst at liberty on bail, to which identical principles apply, Street CJ said in R v Richards [1981] 2 NSWLR 464 at 465: 
      
       
        
         
         “The community must be protected as far as possible from further criminal activities by persons who take advantage of their liberty on bail to commit further crimes. The only means open to the criminal courts to seek to provide this protection is to pass severely deterrent sentences upon those who thus abuse their freedom on bail. This will ordinarily involve a significant accumulation of the sentence for any subsequent offences on top of the sentence proper to be passed for the original offence. It must be made abundantly plain that persons at large on bail cannot expect to commit further crimes “for free”. On the contrary they will receive salutory penalties for the very reason they have abused their freedom on bail by taking the opportunity to commit further crimes.” 
         
        
       
     41 This position was reiterated in this Court in R v Readman (1990) 47 ACrimR 181 at 184, per Maxwell J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreed, when his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This Court has repeatedly stated that the commission of an offence by an offender who is in the community on conditional liberty, whether that be on bail, on a recognisance, or on a parole, will be considered as a matter that aggravates the offence.” 
           
         
        
       
       
       (See also  
       R v Jerrard 
        (1991) 56 ACrimR 297 at 380-1) 
        
       
     42 The policy behind this approach of the courts is, in part, stated by Lee J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Abadee J agreed in R v Vranic (NSWCCA, 7 May 1991, unreported) when his Honour said at p4: 
      
       
        
         
         “The commission of offences on parole demonstrates that the expectation of rehabilitation of the prisoner has not been realised and that through his own conduct the substantial mechanism designed for rehabilitation, i.e. parole has failed to achieve its purpose. The Court in such circumstances cannot proceed on the same expectation of rehabilitation that is open in other circumstances.”  
         
        
       
       
       (See also the reference by Wood CJ at CL to the “betrayal of opportunity for rehabilitation” in  
       R v Tran 
        [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15].) 
        
       
     43 His Honour gave significant weight to the prospects of rehabilitation. The fact that the offences were committed while the Respondent was on parole should have been treated as a significant factor in this regard. 
      
       
     44 Alternatively, the Crown relied on manifest inadequacy. The sentences of four years, which his Honour treated as a starting point, were the bottom of the range suggested in the guideline judgment of Henry. The value of the guilty plea was of greater significance than that assumed in the common case identified in Henry. However, this matter was offset by other considerations. First, the extensive criminal record of the Respondent. Secondly, the particular terror imposed by the weapon of a blood filled syringe. Thirdly, the fact that the offences occurred whilst the Respondent was released on parole.  
      
       
     45 Cases in which the courts have come to sentence for offences of this character are often not precisely comparable. However, some guidance can be obtained. 
      
       
     46 R v Fleming [1999] NSWCCA 142 was a severity appeal in which there was a strong subjective case and, unlike in this case, an express finding of good prospects of rehabilitation. There were five armed robbery offences. The sentence imposed was eight years with a minimum term of four years. The appeal was dismissed. 
      
       
     47 In R v ROS [2000] NSWCCA 175 there were four counts, three armed robbery offences and one assault with intent to rob. There was an additional charge of armed robbery with the use of a blood filled syringe. The offender was sixteen with a long criminal record. There was a strong subjective case based on an addiction first to alcohol, then to heroin. There was substantial supporting evidence indicating an attempt to change his lifestyle. The sentence was a term of nine years with a minimum term of four years and six months. The severity appeal was dismissed. 
      
       
     48 R v Readman, supra, was a Crown appeal from a sentence of a single offence of armed robbery, to which the offender had pleaded guilty. The Respondent was twenty-six years of age at the time of the offence. He had a long criminal record and had committed the offence whilst on parole. There was evidence of a severely deprived childhood with long periods of institutionalisation. The trial judge had imposed a three year minimum sentence and a one year additional term. The Court allowed the Crown appeal and imposed a five year minimum term and an additional term of one year and eight months. 
      
       
     49 Plainly his Honour gave substantial weight to the subjective case put forward for the Respondent. 
      
       
     50 The Respondent’s conduct on the day of his arrest was such as to support the proposition that he had some prospect of changing his ways. After his arrest the Respondent had refused to answer questions after receiving legal advice. After being alone in his cell for about an hour he resolved to change his position. He proceeded to make full admissions of all offences. He said that he wanted to clear everything up and get on with his life. In this he was supported by his girlfriend. This occurred on 22 August 2000. 
      
       
     51 The matter came before his Honour for sentence some six months after the arrest on 15 March 2001. On that occasion the Respondent gave evidence to the effect that he remained determined to change his ways. 
      
       
     52 During the course of his evidence the Respondent indicated on a number of occasions that he wanted to lead a normal life in which he did not take drugs. He indicated that he tried to give up drugs but had failed. He said that heroin “just destroyed my life”. In an affidavit filed in this Court, he affirmed his evidence before Moore DCJ. 
      
       
     53 The subjective case presented on behalf of the Respondent at trial and in substance repeated in this Court did have elements of strength. Of particular significance was the decision made by the Respondent, after contemplating his position in the cell alone, to make all the relevant admissions with respect to these particular offences. This was strongly suggestive of a decision, at that stage, that the Respondent wished to change his life from the long period of drug addiction and criminal offending that had preceded it. Such a realisation was the crucial first step in a process of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, it is of itself only indicative of the possibility of success. It was also a manifestation of “his acceptance of responsibility”, maintained in the plea. (Cameron v The Queen supra at [11] and [22].) 
      
       
     54 Some six months had elapsed prior to the sentencing judge undertaking his task. His Honour had before him no information about what had happened with regard to rehabilitation in that period. His Honour did, however, have the evidence given before him which indicated that the Respondent was still of a mind to change his ways. Nevertheless, his Honour did not feel able to draw, and did not express, any conclusion as to the prospects of a successful rehabilitation. In the absence of a finding that the rehabilitation prospects were in fact high, the subjective case presented to the Court was not of a character which could overwhelm the very serious objective features of the offences, either individually or collectively. 
      
       
     55 As indicated above, at the time the Respondent came before the District Court for sentencing he had been in prison for a period of six months following his arrest for these offences. It is customary for the sentencing court to have material before it about the personal background and conduct of the Respondent, generally in the form of a pre-sentence report and/or a report from an expert, like a psychologist. There was nothing before his Honour of this character. Nor was there any objective evidence before his Honour about the Respondent’s conduct in prison, particularly whether he had pursued any matters which were pertinent for his prospects of rehabilitation. The Respondent gave evidence to his Honour that during his previous period of incarceration, he had in fact been able to continue his habit while in gaol. He suggested, that it was “easy to get drugs in gaol”.  
      
       
     56 It is frequently the case that material is presented to the Court which indicates on the basis of urine testing that a drug user has managed to control his habit for a relevant period of time. There was no such material before his Honour. Nor was there any evidence, of a character frequently adduced, about drug or alcohol counselling. It was necessary for his Honour to give complete credence to the self-serving assertions by the Respondent in the witness box as to his intentions. 
      
       
     57 The evidence about his conduct in gaol about drug taking was decidedly equivocal: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q What do you think you need to do to break that pattern so it does not keep happening? 
         
        
        
         
         A Stay away from heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Are you able to do that in gaol at the moment? 
         
        
        
         
         A If I can try, I’d try. 
         
        
        
         
         Q How have you been going so far? 
         
        
        
         
         A Good.” 
         
        
       
     58 In my opinion, the subjective case was not of sufficient strength, in light of the objective circumstances, to justify the sentences imposed. The sentence as finally structured by his Honour was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     59 The Respondent filed an affidavit in this Court to be used for purposes of exercising the residual discretion not to intervene and in case the Court came to resentence. He affirmed the truth of the evidence he had given before the trial judge, indicated that his circumstances of incarceration had a certain harshness because he was unlikely to obtain a minimum security classification and that he was at the Lithgow Correctional Centre, some distance from his family which lives in Walgett. He also noted that his aunt was ill and that his girlfriend continued to support him whilst he has been in custody. Of particular significance is his undertaking to try to live a drug free life. He noted that he was on a methadone programme with a dose of thirty. He also said that he had volunteered for urine analysis but that had been refused. The Crown did not put before the Court any explanation for such refusal.  
      
       
     60 Again there is nothing in the nature of a detailed report from any carer or expert or prison authority as to his conduct in prison or other material that can assist the Court in determining his prospects of rehabilitation. After the period of some eighteen months which has now transpired since the Respondent was incarcerated for the offences, the Court is apparently expected to assess prospects of rehabilitation on the basis of self-serving assertions without cross-examination or independent verification. Although no onus resides on the Respondent in this respect, the Crown should have been able to assist the Court to a greater degree in this regard. 
      
       
     61 It is unnecessary to reiterate the objective gravity of the offences. As I have said above his Honour did not understate their gravity. Nor is it necessary to repeat the other relevant considerations to which I have referred above. Unless the Court can identify a real prospect of rehabilitation, in my opinion, the substantial and lengthy record of the Respondent is entitled to significant weight. 
      
       
     62 Each offence imposed particular terror on a vulnerable individual by means of the use of an apparently blood filled syringe. This Court has frequently said that individuals who work in isolated locations such as operators of small retail shops, service station attendants, motel receptionists and taxi drivers, have a particular vulnerability in a context where they perform valuable community services. Persons who commit such offences against such vulnerable people must be the subject of condign punishment. 
      
       
     63 Notwithstanding the subjective case put before the Court on this occasion, the offender did have a very long criminal record of persistent offending. Furthermore the offences were committed whilst on bail and on parole, an aggravating circumstance which is particularly pertinent to the prospects of rehabilitation. Whilst some reason had emerged for a belief that steps may been taken towards rehabilitation, the prospects of rehabilitation were not sufficiently strong to justify a sentence which does not reflect the gravity of each offence and of the course of offending. 
      
       
     64 As is well established, it is a primary objective of sentencing for criminal offences that the community must be protected from the commission of crimes, by deterring both the particular offender and other possible offenders – referred to as personal and general deterrence respectively. In a case of the character now before the Court, by an offender with this record, the protection of the community requires a substantial period of imprisonment. It is, however, often the case that such considerations of deterrence are properly tempered by considerations of compassion which arise when the Court is presented with information about the personal circumstances which have led an individual into a life of crime.  
      
       
     65 Such considerations are present in the case before the Court. The Respondent has a personal history of deprivation that is, regrettably, far too common amongst young people, particularly Aboriginal youth.  
      
       
     66 The sentencing principles to be applied by a sentencing court apply in every case, irrespective of the membership of the particular offender of an ethnic or other group. Nevertheless, when imposing sentences courts must take into account, pursuant to those very principles of general application, all of the facts relevant to the circumstances of the offence and of the offender, including facts which may exist by reason of the person’s membership of a particular group. (See e.g. Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 326.)  
      
       
     67 Aborigines who commit crimes of violence are not accorded special treatment by the imposition of lighter sentences than would otherwise be appropriate having regard to all of the relevant considerations, including the subjective features of a particular case. An offender is not entitled to any special leniency by reason of his or her Aboriginality. The principle of equality before the law requires sentencing to occur without differentiation by reason of the offender’s membership of any particular racial or ethnic group. Nevertheless, particular mitigating factors may feature more frequently in some such groups than they do in others. (See R v Fernando (1992) 72 ACrimR 58 at 62-63 as further explained in R v Hickey (NSWCCA, 27 September 1994; unreported); R v Stone (1995) 84 ACrimR 218 at 221-223; R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 esp at [29]-[33]; R v Pitt [2001] NSWCCA 156 at [19]-[21].) 
      
       
     68 The criminal justice system has accurately been described as a “hopelessly blunt instrument of social policy and its implementation by the courts is a totally inadequate substitute for improved education, health, housing and employment for Aboriginal communities” R v Daniel [1998] 1 Qd R 499 at 530 per Fitzgerald P. His Honour outlined the difficulties that arise in this regard at 530-532.  
      
       
     69 The circumstances of the present case are, regrettably, repeated across the entire community. This Court frequently hears appeals from young people who have suffered deprivation in their personal life, have succumbed to addiction - usually first to marijuana and then to heroin - and committed crimes of burglary and armed robbery in order to acquire funds to feed the habit.  
      
       
     70 His Honour referred to the personal history of the Respondent as I have set out above. Further, the Respondent’s father died when he was a baby. He lived with one of his aunts in Walgett who he believed to be his mother until she told him that she was not when he was about eight. When he was young he already began to get into trouble at Walgett - breaking into shops and malicious damage by setting fires. His aunt with whom he lived and her partner were not heavy drinkers, according to his evidence. Nevertheless he saw a lot of drinking in his community and associated violence. His period of offending as a juvenile led him to be institutionalised at Euabalong, at the age of ten or eleven, where incidents occurred about which he gave some evidence. When he left that institution he took up with others. The pattern of offending intensified in the way I have set out. He became addicted to drugs, at first marijuana and subsequently heroin. He ran away from Euabalong. He said this was because of “bad things that had happened to him there”. The allusive evidence given in this regard was accepted by his Honour. Although I find it strains credibility, in the absence of any suggestion that the Respondent has sought treatment, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that he had experienced sexual abuse in Euabalong and that that may have contributed to his addiction. 
      
       
     71 In one respect his Honour made findings which do not find substantial support in the evidence. He said that there was an expression of remorse which arose by reason of the fact that the Respondent admitted that if someone threatened him with a syringe he would feel as frightened as he believed the victims of his crimes felt. I do not see this as an expression of remorse. Indeed in the evidence he gave before his Honour the Respondent was offered an opportunity to express remorse and he did not do so: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q How do you feel about what you’ve done now that you’ve had time to think about it? 
         
        
        
         
         A I don’t know, just want to get this over and done with and just try and move on.” 
         
        
       
       
       I do not see any evidence of significant contrition. 
        
       
     72 His Honour did not refer to the characteristic identified in (ii) in par [162] of Henry of the common case involving a weapon like a knife. A syringe filled with blood is more serious than the category of weapon considered in Henry. 
      
       
     73 In R v Kyrogolu & Tsoukatos [1999] NSWCCA 106 Simpson J said at [88]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Another factor that separates this offence from those described in the guideline is the use of the syringe filled with red liquid. Only one inference could be drawn by the victim from the use of a weapon such as this: that the syringe contained blood and the blood was infected with the AIDS virus or some other deadly or life threatening organism. A weapon more calculated to instil terror into the victim can scarcely be imagined. The use of such a weapon is, in my opinion, if not more serious than the use of a knife, then at the very least right at the outside limits of seriousness of the kind of weapon the guideline contemplates.” 
         
        
       
       
       (See also  
       R v Stone, 
        supra, at 439.) 
        
       
     74 In my opinion, a sentence of seven and a half years discounted, by reason of the admissions and plea, to six years for each offence is the lowest sentence that can be imposed for each of the armed robbery offences. However, concurrent sentences of six years, with a non-parole period of three years, would not reflect the total criminality of the course of offending. 
      
       
     75 As I have noted above, Moore DJC indicated that a sentence for each of the armed robbery offences of four years was appropriate, but that the actual head sentence should be six years by reason of the number of incidents involved. I do not regard this approach as consistent with the High Court decision in R v Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
      
       
     76 Moore DCJ appeared to approach the sentencing exercise on the assumption that all offences before the court should be concurrent unless the principle of totality required an increase. However, these offences were not, in my opinion, part of the same course of conduct.  
      
       
     77 Over a period of weeks, a number of discrete armed robberies were perpetrated. The offence against the police officer at the time of arrest was plainly a distinct and different crime. In this case the starting point should have been that at least some of the sentences would be consecutive, not concurrent. The principle of totality applies to allow partial concurrence, so that time to be served reflects the overall level of criminality disclosed. 
      
       
     78 The circumstance that a single offence is one of a number of armed robberies committed over a relatively short period of time requires either a different starting point or a decision that the sentences be made only partly concurrent. In the light of the authority of the High Court in Pearce the latter would appear to be the preferable course. (See R v Hammoud (2000) 118 ACrimR 66 at [8]-[11]; R v Lemene (2001) 118 ACrimR 131 at [3].)  
      
       
     79 This Court was informed that the parole order was revoked on 15 August 2000 and the Respondent served the remainder of his sentence, being a term of four months and fifteen days commencing on 22 August 2000, expiring on 5 January 2001. It does not appear from the record before this Court that Judge Moore was informed that the period of incarceration commencing on 22 August 2000 constituted the remainder of the original additional term.  
      
       
     80 It is not appropriate to commence the sentences on the day of arrest. The Respondent would suffer no additional punishment by reason of the need to serve the balance of his additional term on the malicious damage charge upon revocation of parole and the, related, offence dealt with in the Local Court. These sentences should commence on the expiration of the original sentence on 5 January 2001. 
      
       
     81 Partial concurrence of the sentences is required to reflect the number of separate crimes and, also, to reflect the quite distinctive offence committed at the time of the arrest. Over and above the additional period of imprisonment that will arise when dating the sentences presently before the Court to the time of the expiration of the additional term, in my opinion a further sentence of twelve months should be imposed by means of partially overlapping the sentences to be served. The armed robbery to be taken into account on the Form 1, is taken into account with respect to the armed robbery of 16 August 2000 which will take effect at the later time. The offence on the Form 1 with respect to the assault on the nurse, is taken into account with respect to the offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon. 
      
       
     82 I have referred above to the additional materials placed before the Court for the purposes of both exercising the discretion not to intervene and for determining the sentence, if the Court decided to do so. As before his Honour, there was no pre-sentence report and no expert reports. Nor is there any evidence of progress with regard to rehabilitation. After the passage of a further twelve months, this aspect of the Respondent’s subjective case is weaker than it was at the time of the sentencing in the District Court. 
      
       
     83 Nevertheless, if the Respondent is released on parole it would be desirable for him to have a longer than usual period of supervision. This constitutes special circumstances which make it desirable to vary the statutory ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period so as to permit three years under supervision. 
      
       
     84 The orders I propose are as follow: 
      
       
       
       (1) Appeal allowed. The sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Moore on 15 March 2001 are quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences are imposed. 
        
        
       (2) With respect to each of the assault with intent to rob on 9 August and the armed robberies of 30 July, 1 August and 8 August, the Respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years commencing on 5 January 2001 and concluding on 4 January 2007, with a non-parole period of three years. 
        
        
       (3) With respect to the offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension, the Respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years commencing on 5 January 2002 and concluding on 4 January 2007, with a non-parole period of three years. 
        
        
       (4) With respect to the armed robbery of 16 August 2000, the Respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years commencing on 5 January 2002 and concluding on 4 January 2008, with a non-parole period of three years. 
        
       
     85 WOOD CJ at CL: I have read the judgment of Spigelman CJ. I agree with the orders proposed, and with the reasons of his Honour. 
      
       
     86 KIRBY J: I agree with the order proposed by the Chief Justice and with his reasons.

     Tort – Negligence – District Court appeal – Liability – Damages – Tort – QuantumThe plaintiff and first defendant were nurses employed at a hospital run by the second defendant. The plaintiff alleged that while assisting a patient the first defendant struck her on the coccyx with a percussion hammer. While the plaintiff did not claim her coccyx had been fractured, she brought evidence of postural problems and persistent ongoing pain to her coccyx, lower back and knee. She sued both defendants for negligence in tort, claiming that the first defendant was primarily liable and that the second defendant was vicariously liable as an employer. The trial judge found against both defendants. The second defendant appealed in relation to liability and quantum of damages.Held: Heydon JA (Sheller JA agreeing, Powell JA dissenting), allowing the appeal:(1) The trial judge’s finding that the incident happened is inherently convincing and internally consistent; there was no basis for overturning this finding: [35].(2) As to liability:a. the injury sustained was a foreseeable risk. The stressful nature of hospital work and the high spirits of the staff made pranks a real possibility and there was evidence that practical jokes were common in the hospital. Patients as well as employees stood the chance of injury as a result of such a prank and no warning had been issued to employees against pranks of the sort in issue: [41]-[46].

     b. the trial judge correctly found that the second defendant failed to apply the appropriate standard of care in directing qualified medical staff not to engage in the relevant activity. There was more than a slight chance of the relevant risk arising and the magnitude of risk was possibly high. No action to alleviate the risk had been taken and there were no conflicting responsibilities to justify this omission: [48]-[52]. Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 applied.c. the argument that compliance with the duty would not have prevented the plaintiff’s injury was rejected. A general or vague or bland or manifestly perfunctory or half-hearted instruction might be disobeyed, but what was required was a warning or instruction of sufficient gravity to make compliance likely: [54]-[56].

     d. the second defendant was directly liable making it unnecessary to consider the trial judge’s findings as to vicarious liability: [60].(3) As to quantum,a. the trial judge’s selection of the plaintiff’s non-economic loss at 38% of a most extreme case was within an appropriate range: [63]-[64].b. the trial judge wrongly took the plaintiff’s fortnightly salary as her weekly salary in calculating future economic loss. That figure and consequential amendments should be made, but the trial judge’s calculation of a cushion sum was valid: [68]-[70].

In lieu thereof, there will be judgment in the sum of $287,252.27 with effect from 6 October 2000. 4. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 5. It is noted that the costs order made by the trial judge stands. 6. Liberty to apply on seven days’ notice is granted.

      MACQUARIE AREA HEALTH SERVICE v EGAN 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments prepared by Powell JA and Heydon JA. 
      
       
     2 Reasonableness is the measure of the nature and extent, in the particular case, of an employer’s duty to protect the employee. In Liftronic Pty Limited v Unver (2001) 75 ALJR 867, McHugh J said at 874 (para 38) that the case of Bankstown Foundary Pty Ltd v Braistina (1986) 160 CLR 301 “emphasises that the employer’s duty is to take reasonable care for the safety of its employees and that what is reasonable is a question of fact to be judged according to the standards of the time.” There could be no doubt that horseplay, a word connoting rough and boisterous activity, between two or more participants, is likely to carry with it risk to any of those participants. If the employer knows, as this employer on the findings at first instance either did or should have, that such activities occur in the workplace, particularly if they take the form of physical assaults upon employees, it is the duty of the employer to protect the employees from the risks of such activities, as his Honour Judge Williams acknowledged, by appropriate counselling or instruction. The workplace was a rehabilitation unit catering for elderly people recovering from problems with hips, knees and strokes. I agree with Heydon JA that the duty alleged by the plaintiff existed and the defendant was in breach of it.  
      
       
     3 Like Heydon JA, I am satisfied that in the work environment of this hospital proper instruction and directions as to the dangers of engaging in horseplay on the premises would almost certainly have dissuaded a nurse employed there from hitting another nurse employed there on the coccyx with a percussion hammer while the victim was manoeuvring a patient in a wheelchair. For the reasons given by Heydon JA, I agree with the orders he has proposed. 
      
       
     4 POWELL JA: I have read in draft the Judgment which has been prepared by Heydon JA with which Judgment I understand Sheller JA to agree. I regret, however, that I am unable to share their Honours’ view that, to the extent to which the Appellant sought to have the Judgment of Williams DCJ set aside and Judgment entered in its favour, the appeal should be dismissed. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that, at trial, the Respondent failed to establish that the Appellant had not discharged the duty of care which it was claimed that the Appellant owed to her. In addition, I am of the opinion that the Respondent failed to establish that the Appellant was vicariously liable to the Respondent for the consequences of Nurse Greenwood’s actions. 
      
       
     5 The Statement of Claim which was filed on behalf of the Respondent is a less than shining example of the pleader’s art. After recounting what was claimed to have been the nature of the action taken by Nurse Greenwood, it continued (RAB 1-2): 
      
       
        
         
         “5. The incident occurred as a result of negligence on the part of the Defendant. 
         
        
        
         
         Particulars of Negligence of the Defendant: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Failing to instruct or properly instruct employees in relation to safe working practices. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Failing to instruct employees against the performance of ‘pranks’ in the workplace. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Failing to counsel against the commission of pranks by employees. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, the Defendant was negligent by its employee enrolled nurse Helen Greenwood in that she: 
         
        
        
         
         (d) intentionally struck the Plaintiff on her tailbone with a patella hammer when the Nurse well knew that that was a potentially dangerous activity.” 
         
        
       
     6 Despite the less than satisfactory form of the Statement of Claim, it seems tolerably plain that the Respondent’s case was advanced on two bases, they being: 
      
       
       
       (a) that the Appellant had failed in its duty of care to her in that it had failed to establish and/or maintain a safe system of work; and 
        
        
       (b) that the Appellant was vicariously liable for the action taken by Nurse Greenwood, which action – so it appears to have been put at trial – although intentional fell within the scope of Nurse Greenwood’s employment by the Appellant. 
        
        
       Each of these suggested bases of liability requires to be dealt with separately. 
        
       
     7 The relationship of an employer to his employee is one which the law has held to generate a duty of care, the scope of which duty is to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the employee to unnecessary risk of injury (Hamilton v. Nuroof (WA) Pty. Limited  (1956) 96 CLR 18; Bankstown Foundry Pty. Limited v. Braistina  (1986) 160 CLR 301). The employer’s general responsibility for the safety of his employees has been held to impose on the employer the following (inter alia) obligations: 
      
       
       
       (a) an obligation to observe reasonable care in the selection of competent fellow employees so that the work can be carried out in reasonable safety, coupled with an obligation, if the employer becomes aware that an employee is likely to prove a source of danger to his fellow employees to take remedial action; and 
        
        
       (b) an obligation to establish and to enforce a system of work which will protect his employees against unnecessary risks. 
        
       
     8 An example of the failure of an employer to fulfil the first type of obligation is to be found in the Judgment of Streatfeild J in Hudson v. Ridge Manufacturing Co. Limited  [1957] 2 QB 348 in which case, for a period of almost four years, one of the defendants’ employees had made a nuisance of himself to his fellow employees, including the plaintiff, a cripple, by persistently engaging in skylarking such as tripping them up. On many occasions he had been reprimanded by the foreman and warned that he would hurt someone, but without effect. No further steps were taken to check this conduct by dismissal or otherwise. Eventually that employee, when indulging in further horseplay, tripped the plaintiff and injured him. In the course of his Judgment, Streatfeild J said  supra at 350: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Mr. Leigh put it in his opening, he does not contend that the employers are vicariously liable for any negligent act of a fellow servant but that they are primarily liable because they were guilty of a breach of their common law duty to take care for the safety of their employees.  
         
        
        
         
         This is an unusual case, because the particular form of lack of care by the employers alleged is that they failed to maintain discipline and take proper steps to put an end to skylarking which might lead to injury at some time in the future. As it seems to me, the matter is covered not by authority so much as principle. It is the duty of employers, for the safety of their employees to have reasonably safe plant and machinery. It is their duty to have premises which are similarly reasonably safe. It is their duty to have a reasonably safe system of work. It is their duty to employ reasonably competent fellow workman. All of those duties exist at common law for the safety of the workman, and if, for instance, it is found that a piece of plant or part of the premises is not reasonably safe, it is the duty of the employers to cure it, to make it safe and to remove that source of danger. In the same way, if the system of working is found, in practice, to be beset with dangers, it is the duty of the employers to evolve a reasonably safe system of working so as to obviate those dangers, and upon principle it seems to me that if, in fact, a fellow workmen is not merely incompetent but, by his habitual, conduct, is likely to prove a source of danger to his fellow employee, a duty lies fairly and squarely on the employers to remove that source of danger. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Here is a case where there existed, as it were in the system of work, a source of danger, through the conduct of one of the defendants’ employees, of which they knew, repeated conduct which went on over a long period of time, and which they did nothing whatever to remove except to reprimand and go on reprimanding to no effect. In my judgment, therefore, the injury was sustained as a result of the defendants’ failure to take proper steps to put an end to that conduct, to see that it would not happen again and, if it did happen again, to remove the source of it. It was for that reason that this injury resulted. Under those circumstances, although it is an unusual type of case, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Leigh is right in his contention that the defendants are liable for the plaintiff’s injuries.” 
         
        
       
     9 The decision in Hudson v. Ridge Manufacturing Company Limited is to be contrasted with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Smith v. Crossley Brothers Limited  (1951) 95 Sol. J. 655 to which Streatfeild J referred in the course of his Judgment. In that case, Pearce J, at first instance, had found the employers liable because injury had been caused to the plaintiff, a boy of sixteen years of age, through the conduct of two apprentices in the misuse of a compressed air pipe, which they put up the unfortunate plaintiff’s rectum. Pearce J held that the defendants had not exercised adequate supervision over the apprentices, and that that lack of supervision was the cause of the plaintiff’s injury and constituted negligence. On the defendant’s appeal, the Court of Appeal (Singleton and Birkett LJJ and Roxburgh J) allowed the appeal. The report, which is in the form of a case note, records: 
      
       
        
         
         “Singleton LJ said that the two apprentices in question had done something which they knew to be wrong. With regard to the alleged lack of supervision of the apprentices, the compressed air pipe had been in the same position for ten years and no accidents had happened before. The defendants had no reason whatever to anticipate that the two apprentices in question would use it in that way. The duty of an employer towards his employees was to take reasonable care for their safety; and the evidence did not show any negligence by the defendants. The injury to the plaintiff resulted from what was wilful misbehaviour by the other two boys and a wicked act which the defendant had no reason to foresee.” 
         
        
       
       
       A similar approach to that taken by the Court of Appeal in  
       Smith v. Crossley Brothers Limited 
         
        supra 
        may be seen in the Judgments of Gorman J in  
       Smith v. Ocean Steamship Company Limited  
        [1954] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 482 
        and of Dunphy J in  
       Antoniak v. The Commonwealth 
         
        (1962) 4 FLR 454 
       . 
        
       
     10 The question then is whether, in the light of such evidence – which in my view was extremely slight and unsatisfactory – as there was at trial, it could be said that the Appellant failed in the respect particularised in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) to discharge its duty of care to its employees, including the Respondent.  
      
       
     11 The Respondent’s evidence in chief as to her experience, or knowledge, of practical jokes in the period – approximately 2½ years – from her commencing at the hospital until the incident complained of was as follows (Black AB 3-40: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. In the time that you worked at the hospital up until September 1995 did you ever see practical jokes or pranks being performed by members of staff on other members of staff? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can you give us some examples? A. Usually when staff were leaving it was a common occurrence that the spa bath be filled up and that the person leaving be put into the spa bath. Another occasion … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I just interrupt you for a minute. How were they put into the spa bath? A. Well literally thrown into the spa bath. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And did you ever see that occur? A. Yes I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On how many occasions did you see that occur in the time you’ve been working at the hospital up until September 1995? A. Probably around twice, two times. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see any other pranks there at the hospital? A. I didn’t see it but I heard about somebody being … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you hear any stories at the hospital about pranks being performed on other members of staff? A. Yes … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you hear stories about other pranks involving other people? A. I heard about a … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I’m not asking you what you heard but did you hear something about other pranks? A. Yes.” 
         
        
       
       
       (The nature of the “other pranks” which the Respondent claimed to have heard was not further explored in the course of the Respondent’s evidence so that it is quite impossible to know whether such alleged pranks would or might have involved some risk to those who were said to be subjected to them.) 
        
       
     12 In the course of her evidence in chief (Black AB 47-48) Miss Crawford, who in September 1995 was the nursing unit manager – the nature and extent of whose duties were not explored in the evidence – and not, as she was at the date of trial, the Director of Nursing, said that, although she had not witnessed any incident involving a member of staff being immersed in a spa bath, when she became aware of such incidents she gave instructions that they were to stop and that, so far as she was aware, they did. Although, in the course of her cross-examination (Black AB 50) it was suggested that other practical jokes were from time to time played on members of staff, what may have been the nature of those alleged practical jokes was not further explored in the course of evidence, so that it is not possible to know whether, if they in fact occurred, such practical jokes would or might have created a risk of injury to anyone. 
      
       
     13 In the circumstance, I am unable to share Heydon JA’s view that there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury arising from horseplay in general in consequence of the Appellant’s failure to give instructions or counselling against that practice, and that there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to patients and to members of staff handling them if the horseplay were directed against those members at the time they were handling the patients. 
      
       
     14 That leaves the question of whether, in the circumstances, the Appellant ought to have been held vicariously liable for Miss Greenwood’s actions.  
      
       
     15 Vicarious liability does not attach for every wrong done by an employee while on the job but attaches only to such wrongs as have been authorised or ratified by the employer or which have occurred within the course of the employee’s employment, a description sufficient to encompass such unauthorised acts on the part of the employee as can be regarded as wrongful and unauthorised modes of performing an authorised task. 
      
       
     16 Despite the stress which was sought on behalf of the Respondent to be placed on the Judgment of Mahoney JA (as he then was) in Petrou v. Hatzigeorgiou  (1991) Aust. Torts Reports 81-071 and, in particular, on the passage referred to by Williams DCJ in the course of his Judgment – which passage in the event was obiter – it is my view that Nurse Greenwood’s actions ought not to have been regarded as merely a wrongful or unauthorised method of carrying out Nurse Greenwood’s tasks as a nurse.  
      
       
     17 For those reasons, it is my view that the appeal should be upheld, the verdict and judgment below set aside and the Respondent ordered to pay the Appellant’s costs of the trial and of the Appeal but to have a Certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951. 
      
       
     18 HEYDON JA: On 6 October 2000 Williams DCJ gave judgment for the plaintiff for $320,370.35 and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs. This is an appeal by the defendant against those orders. The Notice of Appeal contains grounds directed to both liability and quantum. 
      
       
       
       Background 
       
     19 Lourdes Hospital is located at Dubbo. On 17 September 1995 the Hospital had its annual fete. The plaintiff, then aged 25, was a nurse employed at the Hospital. The unit she worked in was a rehabilitation unit basically catering for elderly people recovering from problems with hips, knees and strokes. Helen Greenwood was another nurse employed at the Hospital. The plaintiff complained of an incident which allegedly happened while she was walking backwards and manoeuvring a patient in a wheelchair out of the toilet block of the ward in which she was working. The plaintiff said that Miss Greenwood went past her to a cleaning cupboard. On returning, Miss Greenwood intentionally struck the plaintiff on her coccyx with a percussion hammer. The plaintiff felt immediate pain, and continued to feel pain.  
      
       
     20 According to an investigator’s report (Exhibit B), the plaintiff told the investigator that she reported the occurrence of the alleged incident to Miss Val Crawford, the nursing unit manager, on or about the day it allegedly happened. The report said that Miss Crawford confirmed this. The plaintiff gave evidence to the same effect as that recorded in the investigator’s report, though in the witness box Miss Crawford could not remember the plaintiff having reported the matter to her and could not remember having spoken to an investigator. 
      
       
     21 An accident report form prepared for the defendant’s workers’ compensation insurer on 2 May 1996 (Exhibit C) stated that the plaintiff gave notice of the incident to the defendant through Miss Crawford in December 1995.  
      
       
     22 From December 1995 the plaintiff visited doctors for treatment of the pain from which she was suffering. 
      
       
     23 Miss Greenwood’s evidence was that she first became aware of the allegation in September or October 1996 when the plaintiff rang her, said she was still suffering consequences from the blow, and asked her if she remembered the incident. To this Miss Greenwood replied that she did not. 
      
       
     24 In April 1997 Miss Greenwood made a statutory declaration again professing inability to remember hitting the plaintiff with a hammer. 
      
       
     25 The plaintiff’s Statement of Claim, dated 26 August 1999, advanced in paragraph 4 allegations about the incident conforming to the plaintiff’s account summarised above. 
      
       
     26 The defendant’s Defence, dated 11 April 2000, did not admit paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim, but denied negligence, injury, and damage. It also alleged that the plaintiff’s injuries were caused or contributed to by her own negligence – a proposition which is only consistent with the injuries having been suffered, and a proposition strongly suggestive of an acceptance of the plaintiff’s story. 
      
       
     27 At the start of the trial the defendant told the trial judge that contributory negligence was no longer in issue.  
      
       
     28 After the trial had proceeded for some time on the first day, and after a question in cross-examination to the plaintiff positively suggesting that Miss Greenwood had not struck the plaintiff was objected to because it did not conform with the defendant’s non-denial of the alleged incident, the defendant was given leave to amend its Defence so as to deny the occurrence of the incident. 
      
       
     29 In the witness box Miss Greenwood ceased contending that she could not remember the incident alleged, but rather positively denied that it had happened. 
      
       
     30 The trial judge made four categories of findings which are under challenge in this appeal.  
      
       
       
       (a) The trial judge found that the incident had happened as alleged by the plaintiff, and apparently found that it had happened without malice on Miss Greenwood’s part. 
        
       (b) The trial judge found that the defendant was negligent in failing to protect the plaintiff from “the unwanted effects of horseplay or practical jokes”. 
        
       (c) The trial judge also found that the defendant was vicariously liable for Miss Greenwood’s conduct, and apparently implicitly found that that conduct was incidental to Miss Greenwood’s duties and was in the scope of her employment. 
        
       (d) The trial judge found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover sums reflecting various heads of damage which, after making allowance for various sums to be credited to the defendant, totalled the judgment sum. 
        
        
       Did the incident happen? 
       
     31 The Notice of Appeal did not in terms challenge the trial judge’s finding that the incident happened, but the defendant’s written and oral submissions did.  
      
       
     32 The trial judge’s reasoning was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied the incident as described by the plaintiff did occur. Her evidence is supported in material aspects, particularly in regard to the complaint, by exhibit C and B. It is also supported by the fact of her visits to Dr Riley, a general practitioner, in December 1995 and subsequently to Dr Bowden, another GP who treated her thereafter. Her history to doctors over the years has been basically consistent throughout and accords with her evidence before me. 
          
          
         Whilst it was denied that nurses would have any cause to use a percussion hammer to test or treat patients, it was conceded that if requested to by a doctor the hammer would be obtained and they would comply with that request. It was also conceded that everyone knew where the hammer was located. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         I also have some concerns of Miss Greenwood’s improving memory between 1996 and now. The fact is that people’s memory tends to degrade rather than improve over time and whilst I can well understand her not being able to remember such an incident 12 months later I find it difficult to accept that now, almost 5 years later she is positive that the incident did not happen at all. 
          
          
         Miss Crawford’s evidence does not really take the matter any further for the reasons I have already indicated. [That was a reference to her lack of recollection.] 
          
          
         The plaintiff was criticised because she maintained or mentioned for the first time in evidence a fact, namely that she had spoken to Miss Greenwood about the matter whilst they were writing up reports at the end of the shift. She is also criticised as to not saying anything to Miss Greenwood immediately the accident occurred. It also appears that the area where the percussion hammer was kept was some distance away from the area where the incident occurred. In regard to the latter, I do not see that as a matter of any consequence going to suggest that the incident could not possibly have happened. There is no reason why a nurse would not combine a number of tasks at the one time so that the location of the hammer, to my mind, is immaterial. 
          
          
         I found the plaintiff to be an honest witness, endeavouring to give the best recollection of events occurring now some four and a half years ago. The fact that she remembers an additional matter at this point of time I do not see as reflecting on her credit, indeed, she has given other evidence in regard to a subsequent accident which occurred in September 1997. That could be regarded as contrary to her interests in that she says that her back pain was ongoing and worse from that point of time. The additionally remembered fact that she gave evidence of really takes the matter little further in any event. I do not see it as an attempt on her part to firm up the facts of the incident. 
          
          
         In regard to the incident itself, given that it was fete day, given that she was attending a patient in a wheelchair and given that she, at the time, did not expect any adverse consequences, I can understand her not saying anything to Miss Greenwood immediately, particularly if an altercation at that point of time was likely to have upset the elderly patient she was dealing with. In any event, the plaintiff says that she gave Miss Greenwood a filthy look and Miss Greenwood just laughed. 
          
          
         The plaintiff was criticised as to her memory of when she saw the hammer. In examination in chief she said she saw the hammer in Miss Greenwood’s hands after the event but in cross-examination she said she saw it before. Again I do not see this as a critical credit issue that would entitle me to totally disbelieve the plaintiff for some reason. 
          
          
         The plaintiff at the time of the event was apparently backing a patient out of the toilet area when Miss Greenwood went past her from behind to a cleaners cupboard, obtained something and came back past the plaintiff again. The plaintiff first saw Miss Greenwood over the left shoulder coming from behind her and in cross-examination said at that time Miss Greenwood had a percussion hammer in her right hand. After agreeing that her evidence was different to what she had said in examination in chief she went on to say that she was clear, at least, that she saw the hammer when Miss Greenwood was coming back from the cleaners cupboard. Given the relative positions of the parties at this time I do not see that conflict in the evidence as being critical. 
          
          
         The plaintiff has said that although the blow was painful she thought it was a transitory situation and not likely to be of long duration. Further, she knew that there was no malice behind the blow and I can well understand that at that point of time she would have felt that nothing would have come of the incident and it was thus, eminently forgettable. I also have difficulty in understanding why the plaintiff would make up such a specific incident which was easily capable of being checked.  
          
          
         I am satisfied on the medical evidence that although the blow may not have fractured the coccyx it did cause problems consequent upon that blow. If the plaintiff was making something up she could easily have said that she slipped on a wet floor and sat on her bottom. She undoubtedly had an injury. 
          
          
         The defendant has been unable to suggest an alternative as to how that injury occurred. As stated I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff sustained injury in the [manner] alleged.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     33 In the defendant’s first set of written submissions to this Court, the evidence of the plaintiff, Miss Greenwood and Miss Crawford was summarised. The following two submissions were then put: 
      
       
        
         
         “The appellant submits that it could not have foreseen the conduct that occurred would have involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. 
          
          
         The facts of this matter involve two competent and fully trained nurses who would be expected to be familiar with the nature and extent of injuries traumatically induced.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     34 In oral argument the defendant’s submissions moved from challenging the plaintiff’s honesty, to challenging the plaintiff’s reliability, to suggesting that even if the plaintiff was struck she was not struck intentionally, and back again to earlier challenges. It was submitted that since the plaintiff could not see what actually happened, she was only giving evidence of conclusions, and that her failure to complain speedily deprived Miss Greenwood of the chance of offering an innocent explanation and rendered innocent her failure to remember and then her denial. The defendant submitted that the finding made by the trial judge was not available to him. 
      
       
     35 The difficulties, such as they were, in the plaintiff’s evidence were dealt with in some detail and with some care by the trial judge. It is possible that some other trier of fact might have arrived at a different conclusion. But the trial judge’s reasoning is inherently convincing and internally consistent. It is also based in large measure on a preference for the plaintiff’s credibility over the credibility of Miss Greenwood. The history given by the plaintiff to doctors, investigators, lawyers and the court was, so far as the alleged conduct is concerned, consistent. The defendant did not point to any method by which this Court could legitimately overturn the trial judge’s findings consistently with the line of authorities associated with Abalos v Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167. Indeed the defendant’s criticisms, it must be said bluntly, were far-fetched and wholly lacking in force. This aspect of the appeal fails. 
      
       
       
       Direct liability of the defendant for negligence 
       
     36 The trial judge set out his reasoning on the question of the defendant’s direct liability for negligence and on the question of the defendant’s vicarious liability for Miss Greenwood’s striking of the plaintiff in an intertwined way as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant says that it was not foreseeable that this type of incident might occur and that even if it was foreseeable what possible response could the hospital make having regard to the principles laid down by Mason J in  
         Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
         . 
          
          
         The defendant says that Miss Greenwood’s actions on that day were not incidental to her carrying out her normal duties and were outside the scope for employment. Whilst there were incidents of specific pranks in relation to employees being dumped in the spa bath before they left their employment there had been no prior such incident. However, Miss Crawford conceded that she was aware that people do play jokes on each other from time to time, but apart from verbally warning some of the staff at some time, either before or after this incident, in regard to the spa horseplay there was no other direction, written or otherwise, in regard to the effects of inappropriate horseplay, pranks or practical jokes from the hospital administration. 
          
          
         I was referred to the case of [ 
         Petrou v Hatzigeorgiou 
         ] (1991) Australian Torts Reports [81-071] at p 68559. There are a number of passages in that report that I have found helpful. The first appears at page 68563. There his Honour Mahoney JA with whom Kirby P and Priestley JA agreed said: 
          
           
            
           ‘In such a context there are things which specifically an employee is directed to do as part of his employment. There are results which he is expected to achieve but which he is permitted to achieve by doing such things as he thinks appropriate, and there are things which they are not directed to be done or authorised to be done in these senses the employer knows an act occur in the workplace and tolerates them as part of the environment. Some forms of horseplay at least are, I think, of this latter character. If Mr [Dimitriadas] in the course of finding the compressed air hose and taking it to his workplace had squirted the plaintiff I am inclined to think that any injury resulting from it would be the vicarious responsibility of the employer.’ 
            
           
          
         His Honour further went on to the following page: 
          
          
           
           ‘There is no doubt a point beyond which what takes place in the workplace is not, in the general sense, to which I have referred, an incident of the work or part of the workplace environment for this purpose’. 
            
           
          
         And further on his Honour said: 
          
          
           
           ‘The employer’s duty is most frequently seen as involving establishment of the proper system of work and the maintenance of that system, but the duty is not limited to that. It extends at least in certain respects to, for example, the supervision and care of the course of the work to prevent injury to the employee in the employment context. I do not mean by this that it is the duty of an employer to prevent injury to an employee from, for example, every casual act of a negligent character by third parties in the context of the workplace. Whether there is an obligation of this kind and the content of it need not be determined in this case.’ 
            
           
          
         Now whilst the facts of  
         Petrou 
          are distinguishable both as to the nature and way in which the horseplay came about and the principal issue the court had to decide in that case which related to the liability of a partner in a business for the acts of the other partner who himself had participated in the horseplay and was responsible for the final tragic act, the passages referred to are helpful in resolving the issue in this case, particularly Mahoney JA’s reference to Mr [Dimitriadas’] behaviour with the air hose, which seems to be on all fours with the behaviour of Miss Greenwood in this case. I am satisfied that this was a special day in the hospital. It was the annual fete. Spirits were no doubt higher than on a normal day. I see little to distinguish Miss Greenwood’s behaviour in this case vis-à-vis the plaintiff, an employee of the defendant, and Mahoney JA’s reference to Mr [Dimitriadas] at page 68563 of the Judgment. Clearly an employee has a duty of care to its employees to protect them as far as possible from the unwanted effects of horseplay or practical jokes. That duty of care could be discharged by appropriate and consistent instruction and educational staff. Unfortunately its human experience that not everyone has the capacity to see through the possible consequences of their acts or remember those consequences having only been told on perhaps one occasion about the effects of them. I am not satisfied that the defendant’s awareness of pranks in this case was necessarily confined to incidents with regard to the spa. There is no evidence of any counselling or instruction of employees in regard to pranks, by the employer, apart from whatever Miss Crawford said to some employees at some time. In my view that was insufficient and there is no evidence in any event that it was given before this accident occurred. 
          
          
         I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the employer was negligent. I am also satisfied in accordance with [ 
         Petrou’s 
         ] case that the employer was vicariously liable for Miss Greenwood’s actions.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     37 The defendant’s first set of written submissions to this Court narrated the relevant factual findings of the trial judge. They also pointed out the following aspects of the evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “In evidence the plaintiff agreed in cross-examination it was not part of her duties to use a patella hammer and that only doctors checked reflexes (Black 20N). The plaintiff agreed it was not part of Ms Greenwood’s duties to use a patella hammer (Black 20O). 
          
          
         The plaintiff agreed the patella hammer was quite some distance away from the toilet cubicle where this event occurred (Black 20R). 
          
          
         The plaintiff agreed that nothing like this had happened to her at work before this (Black 20I). 
          
          
         In evidence in chief, Ms Greenwood denied she was required to use a patella hammer in the course of her duties (Black 38O). 
          
          
         Ms Greenwood, in evidence in chief, said the patella hammer was kept some distance from the toilet cubicles (Black 38R). In cross-examination, Ms Greenwood agreed that pranks at work were not entirely foreign to the hospital (Black 42D). 
          
          
         Ms Greenwood agreed that she was aware of other pranks in the workplace apart from people being placed in the spa when they were leaving (Black 42N). 
          
          
         In cross-examination, Ms Greenwood agreed that there were occasions when she was required to carry around the percussion hammer (Black 43F). 
          
          
         Ms Crawford, in examination in chief, said she issued instructions that pranks were to stop because of the occupational health and safety issues involved (Black 47X-Z). 
          
          
         Ms Crawford knew only of pranks when people were leaving the hospital (Black 50G-I). 
          
          
         In cross-examination, Ms Crawford agreed she knew that from time to time people played jokes on one another (Black 50O). 
          
          
         In cross-examination, Ms Crawford agreed that because of rotating shifts being worked, when instructions were given not all people were there (Black 50T). 
          
          
         There is not evidence as to the time of any direction given by Ms Crawford.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     38 The defendant advanced two propositions. One was that the trial judge erred in finding that the risk of injury sustained was a foreseeable risk. The other was that the trial judge “erred in finding that the Defendant failed to apply the appropriate standard of care in directing qualified medical staff not to engage in the alleged activity that caused the alleged injury.” The two propositions were supported by the following arguments. 
      
       
        
         
         ""The appellant submits there was [no] obligation or duty on the appellant to prevent injury to any employees from every casual act of a negligent character by third parties in the workplace. 
          
          
         The appellant submits that it could not have foreseen the conduct that occurred would have involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. 
          
          
         The facts of this matter involve two competent and fully trained nurses who would be expected to be familiar with the nature and extent of injuries traumatically induced. 
          
          
         It is submitted that the appellant could not have foreseen such an activity as being likely to happen.  
          
          
         In the alternative, if the event were found to be foreseeable it is submitted that the magnitude of the risk is negligible and the degree of probability of its occurrence is negligible. 
          
          
         There is no real risk of the event occurring. At its highest [it] could only be said that there was the unreal possibility of the risk eventuating. 
          
          
         The appellant submits there has been no breach of duty by it.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     39 So far as the defendant’s argument rested on its first proposition, that relating to foreseeability, it is useful to bear in mind what Glass JA said in Minister Administering the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, 1979 v San Sebastian Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 268 at 295-296: 
      
       
        
         
         “Since the proximity relationship permeates much of the discussion which follows, it is as well to say something at this point about ‘the foreseeability of the plaintiff’s damage’ which is sometimes equated with it. The blunt notion that they are interchangeable, although encouraged by earlier decisions, has been sharpened by subsequent analysis which has rejected ambivalent terms such as likely and unlikely and displaced reasonable foreseeability in favour of the more precise term reasonably foreseeable possibility. Coupled with this a recognition has emerged that the foreseeability inquiry at the duty, breach and remoteness stages raises different issues which progressively decline from the general to the particular. The proximity upon which a  
         Donoghue 
          type duty rests depends upon proof that the defendant and plaintiff are so placed in relation to each other that it is reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that careless conduct of  
         any kind 
          on the part of the former may result in damage of  
         some kind 
          to the person or property of the latter:  
         Chapman v Hearse 
          (1961) 106 CLR 112, at 120, 121. The breach question requires proof that it was reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that  
         the kind  
         of carelessness charged against the defendant might cause damage of  
         some kind 
          to the plaintiff’s person or property:  
         Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd; The Wagon Mound (No 2) 
           
         [1967 
         ] AC 617, at 642, 632,  
         Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
          (1980) 54 ALJR 283, at 285, 286; 29 ALR 217, at 219-222. Of course, it must additionally be proved that a means of obviating that possibility was available and would have been adopted by a reasonable defendant, ibid. The remoteness test is only passed if the plaintiff proves that  
         the kind 
          of damage suffered by him was foreseeable as a possible outcome of the kind of carelessness charged against the defendant:  
         Mount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey 
          (1970) 125 CLR 383, at 390.” 
          
          
         
        
       
       
       That was unanimously accepted as a correct statement of the law by this Court (Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Hope AJA) in  
       G G Rudge v Murray Tractors Importers Pty Ltd 
        (9 November 1989, unreported). So far as Glass JA’s formulation depends on the assumption that proximity remains a significant element in the law, it must be read in the light of later contrary authority:  
       Sullivan v Moody 
        (2001) 183 ALR 404 at [43]-[48] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. But its analysis of foreseeability remains sound. The defendant’s submissions appear to be directed to denying the existence of Glass JA’s second type of foreseeability – that which must be established if breach is to be proved.  
        
       
     40 So far as the defendant’s argument rested on the standard of care, it appeared to contend that the trial judge had misapplied what Mason J said in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48: 
      
       
        
         
         “In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position. 
          
          
         The considerations to which I have referred indicate that a risk of injury which is remote in the sense that it is extremely unlikely to occur may nevertheless constitute a foreseeable risk. A risk which is not far-fetched or fanciful is real and therefore foreseeable. But, as we have seen, the existence of a foreseeable risk of injury does not in itself dispose of the question of breach of duty. The magnitude of the risk and its degree of probability remain to be considered with other relevant factors.” 
          
          
         
        
       
       
       Foreseeability 
       
     41 Glass JA’s test is that there can be no breach of duty unless it was reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that the kind of carelessness charged against the defendant might cause damage of some kind to the plaintiff’s person or property. The kind of carelessness charged against the defendant was put thus in the particulars to paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) Failing to instruct or properly instruct employees in relation to safe working practices. 
          
          
         (b) Failing to instruct employees against the performance of ‘pranks’ in the workplace. 
          
          
         (c) Failing to counsel against the commission of pranks by employees 
         .” 
          
         
        
       
       
       The defendant did, at a later stage of its argument, contend that as a matter of causation even if the instruction or counselling had been given, it would not have prevented the injury. Assuming for the moment that that issue is decided in the plaintiff’s favour, it was reasonably foreseeable as a possibility that that kind of carelessness might cause some kind of physical injury to the plaintiff. That is so for the following reasons. 
        
       
     42 First, many nurses and other staff who work in hospitals are young and high spirited. Their duties are stressful and repetitive. No doubt these features existed at Lourdes Hospital. At least on semi-festive occasions, such as occasions when members of staff were departing or a fete was being held, and probably on other occasions as well, practical jokes were a real possibility. The reasonable foreseeability of that possibility is not diminished by the fact that paramedical personnel should be, and usually are, more solicitous about the health of each other and the patients than many other classes of employees.  
      
       
     43 Secondly, there was specific evidence that pranks which were capable of causing physical injury actually occurred. That evidence concerned the practice of throwing members of staff into the spa bath on occasions when they were leaving their employment at the Hospital. The plaintiff witnessed this occurring twice in the two and a half years before Miss Greenwood struck her, and she saw this being witnessed by Miss Crawford, the nursing unit manager. Miss Crawford denied witnessing it, but admitted she was aware of it. She said she issued an oral instruction to some but not all staff to stop it because if there were water on the floor there was a chance of patients and staff slipping on the floor. She could not say whether this instruction was given after the plaintiff’s injury or not. She said that to her knowledge there were no general instructions given to all staff to abstain from practical jokes. Miss Greenwood was aware of the practice of immersing people in the spa bath fully clothed; initially she agreed they were thrown in, but later withdrew that. Since they were immersed fully-clothed, there was a risk of damage to whatever property they had on them. Even if the victims were consenting in a general way to the practice of immersion, the particular mode of immersion entailed the risk that some movements might be engaged in without the consent of the victims, and thus there was a risk of injury to those persons. Hence not only was there a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to be inferred from the general circumstances of hospital life, but there was actual knowledge on the part of the staff of that risk, including staff in a position to give instructions to alleviate the risk. 
      
       
     44 Thirdly, there was also general evidence that practical jokes were common within the Hospital. Miss Greenwood said that pranks were not entirely foreign to the Hospital. Miss Crawford, while not being prepared either to admit or deny the existence of practical jokes, was prepared to admit that they could be played from time to time. The plaintiff heard stories about pranks. While not all pranks or practical jokes involve physical contact or create a risk of physical injury, some do.  
      
       
     45 Fourthly, Miss Crawford admitted that the employees at the Hospital needed to be reminded of or told about the importance of not getting involved in practical jokes because they might have dangerous consequences.  
      
       
     46 Not only was there a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury arising from horseplay in general in consequence of the defendant’s failure to give instructions or counselling against that practice, but there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to patients and to members of staff handling them if the horseplay were directed against those members at the time they were handling the patients. The plaintiff submitted that if the patient whom the plaintiff had been wheeling out of the toilet block had been injured by the plaintiff’s involuntary reaction to the pain caused by Miss Greenwood’s blow or otherwise injured as a result of it, there would be no question but that the defendant would have been liable to the patient. That must be so. Of course the fact that a duty is owed to a patient and the fact that that duty is breached do not necessarily establish either that a like duty was owed to the plaintiff having direct personal charge of that patient or that that like duty was breached: Palsgraf v Long Island Ry Co 162 NE 99 at 100-101 (1928); Bourhill v Young [1943] AC 92 at 108; Ashrafi Persian Trading Co Pty Ltd v Ashrafinia [2001] NSWCA 243 at [74] and [76]-[77]. But the patients in the plaintiff’s care were mainly elderly and were all incapacitated by some condition calling for rehabilitation. The very fact that the plaintiff was engaged in carrying out her duties to a disabled patient – concentrating on the task in hand, oblivious to the light- heartedness of others, positioned with her back necessarily turned to the passing traffic and therefore likely to notice little about it – increased her vulnerability and reduced her opportunities to avoid injury.  
      
       
       
       The response of a reasonable man 
       
     47 Whether the defendant was in breach of duty depends on what response a reasonable man would make to the reasonably foreseeable risk of injury. This calls for a consideration of the factors described by Mason J in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48.  
      
       
     48 First, the degree of probability of the risk occurring was not slight. Making allowances for Miss Crawford’s bad memory and Miss Greenwood’s unsatisfactoriness as a witness, and the general defensiveness of both of them, it seems that pranks and practical jokes were sufficiently common for some injury to occur at some time, even though there is no evidence that any other prank at the Hospital caused physical injury. 
      
       
     49 Secondly, the magnitude of the risk to persons in the position of the plaintiff, if it came to pass, was capable of being high in view of the inherent fragility of the human body and the fact that persons in the position of the plaintiff, concentrating solely on the need to care for their disabled patients, were not in a position to take any precaution reducing the risks of injury. 
      
       
     50 Thirdly, alleviating action in the form of an instruction from whatever level of authority was necessary to desist from practical jokes on pain of dismissal or on pain of what ever other sanction the defendant had available would not have been expensive, difficult or inconvenient. There was certainly no evidence to suggest that that course would have been expensive, difficult or inconvenient. There was evidence that Miss Crawford had given an instruction to some of the staff in relation to a particular type of practical joke. That instruction was obviously not expensive, difficult or inconvenient. 
      
       
     51 Fourthly, there was no evidence that the defendant was subject to any other conflicting responsibilities which could create an obstacle to taking alleviating action. Indeed there is some evidence that paying attention to health and safety among the staff was seen as a positive responsibility. There was a Health and Safety Committee with staff representatives on it already in existence at the Hospital which presumably had either power or influence.  
      
       
     52 Thus the duty alleged by the plaintiff existed and was breached. Miss Crawford admitted that the only instruction about pranks she ever gave was an oral instruction to a section of the staff, though not all of them, and that instruction was limited to the practice of immersing staff members in the spa pool. She also admitted in effect that even that instruction may not have been given until after the injury to the plaintiff. She further admitted that employees at the Hospital needed to be reminded of or told about not getting involved in practical jokes because they might have dangerous consequences. The plaintiff had never received either written or oral instructions about practical jokes.  
      
       
       
       Causation in fact 
       
     53 The defendant submitted that even if it had a duty to give instructions forbidding horseplay and the like, and even if it was in breach of that duty, that breach could not have been causative of the plaintiff’s loss because compliance with the duty would not have been effective to prevent the plaintiff’s injury.  
      
       
     54 There is no evidence to support this submission. There is no evidence that Miss Crawford’s instruction about the spa was disobeyed by any of the staff who heard it. The defendant’s submission, so far as it had any strength, derived it from the rhetorical device of characterising the relevant instruction or warning as merely “general” or “generalised”. While it is true that a general or vague or bland or manifestly perfunctory or half-hearted instruction might be disobeyed, once it is concluded that the tests in Shirt’s case were satisfied sufficiently to justify the conclusion that there was a breach of duty, the duty breached was one which, if it were to be performed, would call for a warning that was likely to be effective. The precise power of Miss Crawford was unclear; if she did not hold an office having the authority to give a warning or instruction of sufficient gravity, a warning or instruction should have been given by a person who did hold such an office, and in a form making it likely that staff would comply. The defendant submitted that there was “nothing really” that it could have done. To submit that is to submit that it had no control whatever over its employees in an important matter affecting the health of both staff and patients. However hard the lives of employers have been made by modern legislation, they do retain some control over their employees in fact, and ex hypothesi they have it in law.  
      
       
     55 This reasoning is the stronger if the only aspect of the relevant duty breached which is focused on is alleviating the risk of physical injury to staff caused by horseplay while the staff were attending to patients. It is probable that even the most irresponsible employee, if reminded by a sufficiently clear and stern instruction, would have appreciated that whatever other forms of horseplay might be engaged in, horseplay directed to a member of staff wholly concentrating on patient needs and unlikely to be sharing the light-hearted mood of the perpetrator of the horseplay was dangerous and to be avoided. It follows that there is no reason to suppose that such an instruction would not have been causally effective to avoid the injury. 
      
       
     56 In Betts v Whittingslowe (1945) 71 CLR 637 at 649 Dixon J said that at least in some circumstances: 
      
       
        
         
         “the breach of duty coupled with an accident of the kind that might thereby be caused is enough to justify an inference, in the absence of any sufficient reason to the contrary, that in fact the accident did occur owing to the act or omission amounting to the breach … “ 
          
         
        
       
       
       That inference can be drawn in the present circumstances.  
        
        
       Other issues 
       
     57 The defendant did make a submission orally that the trial judge erred in saying “an employer has a duty of care to its employees to protect them as far as possible from the unwanted effects of horseplay or practical jokes”. However, there was no relevant ground of appeal; the submission was left completely undeveloped; and, though loosely expressed, the trial judge’s proposition is so generally stated that it cannot be said to be wrong.  
      
       
     58 The defendant did not submit that, assuming issues of duties of care, breach of duty and causation in fact were decided against it, there was any other basis on which it could avoid liability.  
      
       
     59 Hence the defendant has not shown that the trial judge was in error in finding the defendant to have been in breach in duty of care it owed directly to the plaintiff.  
      
       
       
       Vicarious liability of the defendant for Miss Greenwood’s act of striking 
        
       
     60 In view of the conclusion just reached, it is unnecessary to consider whether the alternative basis of the trial judge’s decision, which rested on the defendant’s vicarious liability for Miss Greenwood’s battery, is correct. Wide though the law of vicarious liability can be, there are certain difficulties in that aspect of the trial judge’s reasoning, but since they need not be considered, there is no point in doing so. 
      
       
       
       Damages: non-economic loss 
       
     61 The trial judge assessed the plaintiff’s non-economic loss at 38% of a most extreme case. 
      
       
     62 He made the following relevant findings: 
      
       
        
         
         “Having regard to the weight of the above medical evidence I am satisfied the plaintiff suffered an injury to her coccyx which, while probably not a fracture, led to the condition known as coccydynia, which is, on the evidence, an extremely painful and difficult condition to treat. I am satisfied that the postural changes brought about by that condition led to her developing a symptomatic lumbar spine condition and problems with her right knee. I am also satisfied that the combination of continued pain in regard to the coccyx and the lower back, but principally her coccyx together with the developing pain in her right knee coupled with retrenchment from work because of her lack of physical fitness. Whilst responsible for the development of her psychological problems, whilst it may be that there was a pre-disposition to depression within the family that is neither here nor there because there is no evidence of the plaintiff ever having psychological problems before the accident. If in fact she was a vulnerable person then the defendant takes her as it finds her. In any event the plaintiff has shown remarkable spirit in endeavouring and partially succeeding in remaining in the workforce, albeit she is now in a job that she does not like and is far removed from her qualifications and experience. I am also satisfied that her psychological condition, whilst initially severe, has ameliorated with treatment and will eventually subside. 
          
          
         As has been referred to in the medical history the plaintiff sustained a further work related incident with the same employer in September 1997. … 
          
          
         In cross-examination the plaintiff said of the second accident that she had back pain before the incident, enough to cause her aggravation but it was more severe after, and had continued. She was asked to comment on notations in Dr Bowden’s notes which are Exhibit D and generally agreed with the notations as far as she could remember. She agreed that as far as she was concerned the incident of September 1997 was very painful and caused a lot of problems and still does. 
          
          
         However, in a way the matters put to the plaintiff in cross-examination in regard to this incident from Dr Bowden’s notes was somewhat selective, in my view, and did not convey a true picture of the situation. At the time of the second incident the plaintiff was some five months pregnant. She was already experiencing increasing pain in the coccyx and the low back. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         In my view the complaints of symptoms post the 1997 incident are remarkably similar to the complaints to Dr Bowden pre that incident. Having regard to Dr Bowden’s notes and Dr Benanzio’s report and his specific reference to both incidents, and to some extent Dr Millar’s report which, whilst mentioning both incidents, is less specific as to causation, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the September 1997 incident acted on a back that was already stressed by the coccydynia and the postural problems caused thereby to the lumbar spine. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         I am satisfied that any continuing effects of the second incident were as a result of and incidental to the injuries already sustained in the first incident. I am not satisfied that the second incident has resulted in the plaintiff being unable to work in her chosen profession, and as far as the second incident is concerned I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that that incident would be likely to give rise to any further claim for weekly compensation or medical expenses. 
          
          
         It is significant in this regard that the plaintiff’s decreasing ability to work was not consequent upon the second incident but consequent upon the operation of 21 August 1998 and the failure of that operation to have the symptoms of her coccyx alleviated. 
          
          
         The plaintiff, despite initial job retraining whilst on light duties, was eventually dismissed on medical grounds. She completed a course in office administration in June 1999 and after her dismissal on 2 June 1999 obtained employment as a tele-marketer with Flick Pest Control where she does between 8 to 16 hours per week. She says that she would do more if it was offered. She uses a kneeling chair to assist her with her back. She said that she does not enjoy the work and would prefer to be in a job more suited to her qualifications and experience. She feels she would be able to do work in the field of hospital administration if she could get such a job.  
          
          
         I am satisfied the plaintiff is doing her best to overcome the problems of her injury, the problems her injury has caused to her work situation. I am satisfied she is no longer fit for work as an enrolled nurse and would be restricted in regard to other occupants involving prolonged sitting or bending.” 
          
         
        
       
     63 The defendant submitted that the trial judge should have assessed the plaintiff’s economic loss at only 30% of a most extreme case. It pointed out that the trial judge had found that the effects of the second accident had ceased, and that the trial judge had found that the plaintiff’s psychological condition had ameliorated and would eventually subside. The defendant argued that the medical evidence showed some agreement that there was potential for further resolution in future of the plaintiff’s symptoms in her coccyx and lower back. However, while Dr Machart expected “eventual resolution” of the plaintiff’s symptoms, the time-frame contemplated was apparently quite lengthy. On the other hand, Dr Millar said that “eventual recovery” was “a very long term view”. Dr Benanzio held out the possibility of recovery, but did find a 25% permanent impairment of the back. Dr Tomas thought the plaintiff’s back pain “may slowly improve over the coming years”, but said that it was more likely that the pain would remain constant. Dr Hargraves was pessimistic about the plaintiff’s ability to return to full-time nursing. Dr Carter predicted “persistent ongoing painful symptoms”. 
      
       
     64 The medical evidence does not show any consensus about relatively speedy resolution of symptoms, and reference to the medical evidence does not suggest that the trial judge’s selection of 38% was selection of a figure outside an appropriate range.  
      
       
       
       Damages: future economic loss 
       
     65 The trial judge awarded $166,500 for economic loss from the time of the trial.  
      
       
     66 The trial judge’s reasoning was as follows. 
      
       
        
         
         “In regard to future economic loss the plaintiff makes a specific calculation as set out in paragraphs 5A and B of MFI A. The defendant disputes the calculation and says that the better way of dealing with future economic loss in the circumstances of this case is by way of a cushion payment. The plaintiff’s evidence is that she would have had another child and probably will have so that the plaintiff’s calculation allows a current earning rate of seven shifts per week for five years less what she is already earning at present. Additionally the plaintiff says that if offered increased hours with her present employer she would take them. That has to be considered as well. 
          
          
         The plaintiff puts her claim for future economic loss on a calculation of a loss of $385 per week, namely her nurse’s salary of $526 net per week minus her salary at Flick which is $140 net per week on an average for five years, the time over which she will be involved with her children and a further child, thereafter a loss of $250 per week for 30 years, delayed for a period of five years. 
          
          
         The plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for a loss of earning capacity. Sometimes this is capable of direct calculation in which case wage records and the actuarial of tables come into play. Sometimes the plaintiff’s future economic loss is not as capable of direct calculation. In part that is the case here and to that extent I adopt defence counsel’s submission in regard to a cushion payment. Indeed the plaintiff’s own case recognises the generality of its claim in that regard in the way paragraph 5B of MFI A is estimated which can only be an estimate, albeit its an estimate lower than her actual loss at the moment. The plaintiff has a serious ongoing disability that I am satisfied will continue into the future and will preclude her from returning to her chosen profession. Indeed she has limitations even in more sedentary occupations. That situation is unlikely to improve although, of course, she may well in the future attract a job where she achieves a comparable salary to that which she was receiving as a nurse. By the same token had she continued her occupation as a nurse I would expect that she would have progressed beyond the base rate applicable. 
          
          
         In all the circumstances I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff has sustained a significant loss of earning capacity. I calculate that loss by adopting the figure of $75,758 at paragraph 5A of MFI A and adding to that figure a sum of $120,000 by way of a cushion payment. From the sum of both these figures should be deducted a figure of 15 percent for vicissitudes leaving a net figure of $166,500, rounded up. I allow 8 percent of that figure by way of loss of superannuation which comes to a figure of $13,320. Past medical expenses are agreed at $24,174.35.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     67 Counsel then pointed out that the trial judge had discounted the figure for the first five years for vicissitudes at 15% twice whereas it should only have been discounted once. The trial judge then made an adjustment for that error. Together with another adjustment, that produced the result of the figure of $320,370.35 which the defendant was ordered to pay.  
      
       
     68 The plaintiff conceded on appeal in her written submissions that the trial judge had made a further error. The error lay in adopting the figure in paragraph 5(a) of the plaintiff’s schedule of damages. That item said: 
      
       
       
       (a) 7 shifts per week for five years less  
        
         
         average $140/wk earnt, $385 x 231.5 x 85 $75,758 
          
         
        
       In fact the figure should have been calculated on the basis of the plaintiff working seven shifts per fortnight but for the accident, not seven shifts per week. This made the plaintiff’s weekly net earnings but for the accident $365. Deducting $140, that left $225. The product of $225, 231.5 and 0.85 (for vicissitudes) is $44,274. This meant that $31,500 too much was awarded for the five years from the trial.  
        
       
     69 The defendant attacked the allowance by the trial judge of $102,000 as a cushion (i.e. $120,000 less 15% for vicissitudes). The primary basis for that attack is that given the probable improvement in the plaintiff’s disabilities, given the fact that her present capacity to earn is restricted by family commitments, and given the fact that she had retrained herself in such a way as to qualify for a sedentary administrative position, the cushion was excessively large. That attack fails. So far as it rests on the supposed probable improvement in the plaintiff’s disabilities, that improvement is not sufficiently clear to make the attack good for reasons already looked at. The trial judge took into account for the period beyond five years after the trial the fact that the plaintiff would not be encumbered by family responsibilities. The indeterminacy necessarily involved in selecting a particular figure for a cushion is such that it cannot be said that the possibility of acquiring an administrative job invalidates the figure selected.  
      
       
     70 A further consequential adjustment in relation to superannuation is called for by reason of the error conceded by the plaintiff in relation to future economic loss. The trial judge allowed $13,320 for superannuation. That was 8% of the total figure for future economic loss, $166,500, before he made his adjustment to avoid double counting the 15% deduction for vicissitudes in the period for five years after the trial. It is necessary to arrive at a new figure for superannuation by taking 8% of the new figure for future economic loss, which is $146,274 ($44,274 plus $102,000). That new figure for superannuation is $11,701.92. The difference between $11,701.92 and $13,320 actually allowed by the trial judge is $1,618.08. That should be deducted from the judgment sum of $320,370.35, together with the $31,500. The new judgment sum is $287,252.27.  
      
       
       
       Orders 
       
     71 The defendant has failed in all its challenges save for a challenge the correctness of which, at least arithmetically, was in large measure conceded, and a challenge to the superannuation figure which was consequential on that. That is, the defendant succeeded in a challenge to the trial judge’s award for future economic loss, but on a basis it did not put and on a basis conceded in principle by the plaintiff. The defendant won on the small dispute about the financial consequences of the plaintiff’s concession, but that took very little time. In all the circumstances the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal should be borne by the defendant since on every issue on which there was substantial controversy the defendant lost.  
      
       
     72 In view of the possibility of error in recalculating the new judgment sum, provision is made for liberty to apply. 
      
       
     73 The orders proposed are as follows: 
      
       
       
       1. The appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       2. The judgment of the trial judge in the sum of $320,370.35 is set aside. 
        
        
       3. In lieu thereof, there will be judgment in the sum of $287,252.27 with effect from 6 October 2000.  
        
        
       4. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal. 
        
        
       5. It is noted that the costs order made by the trial judge stands. 
        
        
       6. Liberty to apply on seven days’ notice is granted.

    REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Daniel Leslie Miles, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Yolande Adivira Michael at her home at Sefton in the early hours of Sunday, 1 August, 1999. He was a prison escapee at the time, having escaped from the John Moroney Correctional Centre near Windsor on Tuesday, 27 July, 1999. He has also pleaded guilty to a charge of escaping from lawful custody. For a proper understanding of this tragic case, it is necessary to begin by sketching the circumstances which led to his incarceration and his progress within the prison system prior to his escape.  
     
      
    2 On 20 October 1990 the offender stabbed to death a sixteen year old girl named Donna Newland. He himself was only eighteen at the time. He was tried for the murder of Ms Newland in 1992 before Mathews J and, while he did not deny the killing, he raised issues of voluntariness, provocation and diminished responsibility. He was found guilty of murder and her Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for eighteen years, to commence on 20 October 1990, the date of his arrest, comprising a minimum term of twelve and a half years and an additional term of five and a half years. At the time of his escape in July 1999 he had served almost nine years of that minimum term. 
     
      
    3 The offender and Ms Newland had met in Sydney in May 1989, when she was fourteen and he was seventeen. They fell passionately in love and believed that their devotion to each other would last forever. At the end of that year Ms Newland moved with her parents to the Central Coast of New South Wales, and in January 1990 the offender moved to Perth. Over the ensuing few months there was correspondence between them which, as her Honour observed in her remarks on sentence, demonstrated “the continued closeness and intensity of their relationship.”  
     
      
    4 However, over time, Ms Newland established a new group of friends on the Central Coast and formed a relationship with another young man. The offender returned to Sydney from Perth, and it seems that Ms Newland told him that she wanted to live her own life. She reiterated this when he visited her on the Central Coast and she told him about her new relationship. Thereafter, he wrote her what her Honour described as “a barrage of letters”, from which it was clear that he was obsessed by her and by the idea that theirs was an eternal love, and that he could not accept that the relationship had come to an end. He telephoned her regularly, the calls being affectionate at times but abusive on other occasions. 
     
      
    5 There was a body of evidence from former friends of the offender and Ms Newland, which her Honour accepted, that he told them of his intention to kill her. Ms Newland travelled to Sydney to see the offender on the day before the killing, and they were observed to be very affectionate. Nevertheless, that night he told a friend of his, whose evidence her Honour also accepted, that he no longer loved Ms Newland and that he was going to “pay her back” by stabbing her. 
     
      
    6 He normally carried with him a large knife, and it was with this weapon that he killed Ms Newland the following day. In the light of the evidence, and given the manner in which the issues had been left to the jury, her Honour was driven to the conclusion that the killing was premeditated. 
     
      
    7 In evidence before me, the offender said that he had some limited psychological counselling in the earlier part of his prison term, but that he did not pursue it because he saw his crime as “a one off thing, that would never recur …”. I have the benefit of a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, amplified by his oral evidence. Dr Nielssen is well respected in his field, and has first hand knowledge extending over some years of the availability of psychiatric and psychological services within the prison system. He saw the offender’s inadequate pursuit of counselling as the result primarily of a failure on the part of the program then in place to identify his needs and address them. 
     
      
    8 That said, it may be that the necessity to deal with underlying personal problems was masked by his remarkable achievements whilst in prison, particularly in the field of music. He had learnt the piano as a child and was interested in music, but it was in gaol that his creative and executant talents flowered. He developed into an accomplished instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. At the correctional centre where he was housed he was involved with education officers in setting up a recording studio, where he recorded some of his songs. I have been impressed by what I have heard on a CD which is in evidence. He was also assisting other prisoners as a “peer tutor” in music theory and audio engineering. Testimonials prior to his escape from educational staff spoke most highly of his capacity, dependability and commitment. Much of this is apparent from some SBS video footage featuring the offender and one of his teachers, Mr Laurie Fraser, which is also in evidence. (As I understand it, that footage was obtained for a program which has not yet gone to air.) 
     
      
    9 It appears, then, that the offender had made significant progress towards rehabilitation, with the possibility of a musical career upon his release into the community. Tragically, however, it is these very achievements which led to his association with the victim of the murder for which he now stands for sentence. It seems that he and Ms Michael had a mutual friend, to whom he provided a recording of some of his music. Ms Michael, having heard it, became interested in the offender and in the later part of 1998 she wrote to him. After they had corresponded for a time she visited him. She became a regular visitor, as well as communicating with him by phone. Although she was aware of the crime for which he had been imprisoned, a loving relationship developed and they discussed marriage. 
     
      
    10 Ms Michael was the mother of two children from a previous relationship. According to the offender, she told him of circumstances in her life which he later found to be untrue: for example, that her family had been involved in criminal activity, that they had been cruel to her and forced her to use illicit drugs, and that she had been raped. Their relationship was not without its difficulties. There was a time when her letters and visits became less frequent and he suspected that there was another man in her life. However, the offender said that they discussed these difficulties and resolved them and that, at the time of his escape, he believed the relationship to be still on foot.  
     
      
    11 It is the offender’s account that in March 1999 Ms Michael told him that she had been diagnosed with a life threatening illness and also that she had been forced into prostitution. There is clear evidence that she had been a sex worker, but it may not have been true that she was forced into that occupation or that she suffered such an illness. Nevertheless, the offender said that he accepted what she told him at face value and it was this information which led him to contemplate escape. He discussed this with Ms Michael, explaining that he would have the opportunity to escape in July as he expected then to achieve a C2 classification, which would entitle him to work outside the prison. They also discussed moving interstate with the two children and starting a new life. 
     
      
    12 The offender did attain a C2 classification as he expected and, as I have said, he escaped from the John Moroney Correctional Centre on 27 July 1999. He made his way to the house at Sefton where Ms Michael was living. She was not at home but he got into the house, he said, by climbing through a window. In the early evening Ms Michael arrived at the house with her two children, to whom he was introduced. 
     
      
    13 It was the offender’s evidence that she was happy to see him and there was no hostility between them. They spent that night and the following day together, and on the following night it was decided that he would travel to Queensland to see if he could arrange accommodation for them there. He intended to make inquiries through a friend in Brisbane. He said that on the next day, 29 July, he travelled by coach to Brisbane and saw his friend, who believed that she could help. He returned to Sydney on 31 July, arriving around midnight. By the time he got to Ms Michael’s house it was the early morning of 1 August. 
     
      
    14 He said that he knocked on several windows of the house, only to hear Ms Michael demanding that he leave or she would call the police. He thought that she might not have realised that it was he. He looked through a curtain on one of the windows, to see a man sitting next to Ms Michael on a bed. That was a man with whom Ms Michael had had an intimate relationship for a few months, although it appears to have been a casual one.  
     
      
    15 The offender said, and I accept, that he has a patchy memory of what then occurred. However, the evidence establishes that he entered the house by smashing through glass doors leading onto a veranda. He said to Ms Michael, “Why are you running away from me?” He dragged her towards the kitchen, where he obtained a knife. Her children emerged from their room, crying and screaming. She, the children and the other man fled from the house, but the offender chased her and stabbed her in the shoulder. He kicked her daughter when she tried to assist her mother. He stabbed Ms Michael several more times, the major injuries being a wound to the neck which perforated the right jugular vein and a deep wound to the chest which penetrated the lung. She died at the scene, the knife still lodged in her chest with its handle snapped off. 
     
      
    16 The offender ran to a nearby house, where he asked for medical assistance for a gash to his hand and a broken finger. He also asked that the police be called, saying that there had been “an accident”. An occupant of that house called the ambulance and the police, and the offender waited at the house. He was arrested and was taken under police guard to Bankstown Hospital, where he underwent surgery for the injury to his hand. He was discharged later in the morning and taken to Bankstown Police Station, where he was interviewed.  
     
      
    17 He said in evidence that, when he killed Ms Michael, he was consumed by uncontrollable anger. He saw her rejection of him as a betrayal. He believed that by escaping he had turned his back on all that he had achieved during his years in prison, and it seemed to him that he had taken that dire step for nothing.  
     
      
    18 The Crown Prosecutor challenged the offender’s account of his reason for escaping and of what occurred after he arrived at Ms Michael’s home. Ms Michael had not visited him in prison after April 1999, some months prior to the escape, and he acknowledged that her last letter to him was received in either late May or early June. It is the Crown case that, in truth, he escaped because he feared for the future of the relationship and wanted to find out whether she was with another man. This, the Crown Prosecutor argued, demonstrated an abnormal possessiveness similar to that which had led to his killing Ms Newland years earlier. 
     
      
    19 There is some other evidence tending to support that contention. I have copies of a large number of letters from the offender to Ms Michael, and in some of them his displeasure about difficulties in their relationship was expressed in no uncertain terms. In an undated letter he wrote “… you know I’m good enough so why are you continuing to treat with utter disrespect. Honestly babe you’re lucky you’re not a bloke or I would have broke your jaw. In fact I’ve broke bloke’s jaws for less than that …”. More significantly, in a letter of January 1999 he wrote: “I know you have a lot of confusion, but for fuck’s sake would you just turn to me, tell me everything and trust me. I do things babe, I am not a talker. Just ask Donna when I told her to stop playing games with my heart or I would put a hole in her heart. If I say I’ll do something, then believe I’ll do it”.  
     
      
    20 Confronted with these passages in cross-examination, the offender said that he was affected by sleeping pills when he wrote them and that on neither occasion was he suggesting that he would in fact inflict violence upon Ms Michael. The passage from the letter of January 1999, of course, was a reference to his killing of Ms Newland. In evidence, he described it as “an indefensible analogy, and … a disgusting one at that”. He said that it was written out of frustration and meant no more than that when he made a promise he always kept it. He believed that people had treated Ms Michael badly in the past and he was intending to assure her that he would not let her down.  
     
      
    21 A statement of Ms Michael’s sister-in-law records conversations with her on 29 and 30 July which suggest that to her the offender’s escape was both unexpected and unwelcome. She also told her sister-in-law that he had gone through her belongings and found love letters from her to her companion, with which he confronted her angrily. This he denied in evidence.  
     
      
    22 On the other hand, there is also material in the prosecution brief lending some support to the offender’s account. He said that Ms Michael’s visits ceased in April 1999 because she was having some problems with the identification she needed to present to gain access to the prison, and it does appear from the statement of a witness that that identification was false. More importantly, several witnesses state that prior to the offender’s escape she predicted that he would be at large at about the relevant time. She could not have believed that he had any prospect of release at the end of July 1999, and what she told those people is consistent only with her knowing that he intended to escape. 
     
      
    23 There is evidence in the prosecution case that Ms Michael did not always tell the truth. This emerges primarily from the statement of a friend of hers, who also gave evidence at the committal proceedings. It is consistent with this that Ms Michael may well have told the offender, falsely, that she had been forced into prostitution and was seriously ill. From the committal evidence of her friend it also emerges that Ms Michael might have conveyed to the offender that their relationship was enduring when, in fact, she was drifting away from him. 
     
      
    24 The offender’s evidence was the subject of searching cross-examination and, while he clearly had a motive to put his actions in the best possible light, he did not impress me unfavourably as a witness. His account appears to be broadly consistent with what he told police on the day of his arrest. He acknowledged that, at the time he escaped, he feared that Ms Michael might have formed another relationship. However, I would not conclude that that was his reason for escaping. I accept that he and Ms Michael discussed his plan to escape, and that he did so out of concern for her welfare and in the hope that he and she could start a new life in another state. Equally, I accept his account of his interaction with Ms Michael in the days following his escape. Certainly, I would not prefer the hearsay material in her sister-in-law’s statement to his sworn evidence about the matter. 
     
      
    25 The Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that this killing was not premeditated. In particular, he did not suggest that the offender had escaped with the intention of killing Ms Michael if he found her with another man. On the other hand, he argued that he must have been aware of his propensity to react violently to rejection and must have foreseen the possibility of his inflicting violence upon Ms Michael if his worst fears were realised. I can see the force of that argument, particularly in the light of the passages from his letters to which I have referred, but I would hesitate to make that finding. Disturbing as to those passages in the letters are, I incline to the view that they were rhetorical. In any event, I doubt that the offender had sufficient self awareness at that time to have the insight for which the Crown contended.  
     
      
    26 The Crown Prosecutor also argued that this killing, like that of Ms Newland, was purely the result of the offender’s inability to accept rejection. In effect, said the Crown Prosecutor, he killed Ms Michael because he had decided that, if he could not have her, no-one else would. However, I consider that his emotional response at the time was more complex than that. No doubt his violent reaction was the product of his dominating and possessive personality, but I accept that he was also moved by his sense of betrayal and his belief that he had squandered everything which he had gained during his imprisonment. 
     
      
    27 None of this is to deny the seriousness of this crime. The offender has killed a second time in circumstances disturbingly similar to the first, and as an escapee while serving the term of imprisonment imposed for that first killing. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, whatever be my findings of fact about the circumstances and the offender’s motivation, this murder calls for the maximum sentence of imprisonment for life. He referred to the examination by the Court of Criminal Appeal, in R v Harris (2000) 50 NSW LR 409, of s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 and the common law principles governing the imposition of a maximum sentence. 
     
      
    28 That is a submission worthy of serious consideration. I am mindful that the offender’s culpability for the killing of Ms Michael must be assessed not only by reference to the circumstances in which it occurred, but also in light of the fact that he has killed before: cf Harris, per Wood CJ at CL at par 79 ff. On the other hand, I must not lose sight of the dreadful consequences of life imprisonment in this State, recognised in a number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal and reiterated by Wood CJ at CL in Harris at par 124 ff. Obviously, along with retribution and deterrence, the question of the protection of society looms large in this case. This leads me, then, to the expert evidence before me about the offender’s prognosis.  
     
      
    29 Such information as I have about his upbringing suggests that, while it was not free of difficulty, it was unremarkable and affords no explanation for his criminal behaviour. Dr Neilssen did not diagnose any psychiatric illness and concluded that the offender did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any recognised personality disorder, although he added that he could be described “as having borderline, narcissistic and paranoid personality traits”. In particular, the Doctor considered that both killings arose from the offender’s inability to cope with rejection and to control his emotional reactions. He saw intensive counselling as the only appropriate method of treatment, but he was guarded about the value of counselling as a means of modifying behaviour of that kind. In addition, he said that it is difficult to maintain a long term counselling relationship within the prison system. The best hope he saw for the offender was normal maturation. As he put it in evidence, “… it is generally agreed that there is a reduction in the intensity of maladaptive traits in time, even without counselling. One would hope that those traits would become less likely to lead to maladaptive behaviour.” 
     
      
    30 I also have the benefit of a report of Associate Professor Susan Hayes of the University of Sydney’s Department of Medicine, a well respected clinical psychologist with extensive forensic experience. During her assessment of the offender, she noted that he expressed remorse and showed a measure of insight into the effect of the killing upon the family of Ms Michael, as well as upon his own family and himself. She thought it possible that his inability to control his anger and disappointment was partly the result of the fact that he had not received appropriate treatment whilst in prison prior to his escape. She concluded that he “needs to deal with both offences in counselling, and learn anger management and interpersonal/relationship skills… It is only after lengthy future counselling and assessment that an opinion could be provided as to his long-term risk.” It seems that Associate Professor Hayes is more optimistic than Dr Neilssen about the benefit of counselling. 
     
      
    31 The offender has been undergoing regular psychological counselling since his return to custody, and he said in evidence that there are specific programs, such as anger management, which might be available to him after I have passed sentence. He acknowledged that, at best, he faces a very long period in custody before he could hope for release and he expressed his determination to maintain such treatment and counselling as might be available to him. He also recognised that his difficulties in inter-personal relationships could not be resolved simply by the pursuit of music, valuable as that might be in enhancing his self-esteem.  
     
      
    32 It need hardly be said that I have found this a most difficult sentencing exercise. After anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a case calling for the imposition of the maximum sentence. While the similarities between the murders of Ms Michael and Ms Newland are chilling, the differences between them are significant. Unlike Ms Newland, the killing of Ms Michael was spontaneous and was the product of the complex of emotions to which I have referred. Even though it was perpetrated by a man who had killed before and was an escapee from prison, it does not share the heinousness of the crimes with which the Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing in Harris or the other cases to which reference was made in that decision. In my view, justice would be best served by the imposition of a lengthy determinate sentence. 
     
      
    33 I consider that the offender has a reasonable prospect of rehabilitation. With maturation over the period which he must now serve in prison, together with continued counselling and the pursuit of his artistic endeavours, I have some hope that he will not re-offend upon his release. Consistent with the observation of Associate Professor Hayes, I accept that he is now remorseful. In evidence, he said that he was “disturbed and ashamed” by his crime. He pleaded guilty to murder after his legal advisers had considered possible defences, and tendered him appropriate advice. It was not an early plea and was entered in the face of a very strong Crown case. Nevertheless, he is entitled to a measure of leniency which should be assessed with the assistance of the guidelines promulgated in R v Thompson (2000) 49 NSW LR 363: see s 37A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 and cl 41 of Sch 2 to that Act. It does not appear to me that that position has been altered by the recent decision of the High Court in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6. 
     
      
    34 I have received victim impact statements from Ms Michael’s father and brother, together with a brief statement by her children. It is unnecessary to repeat the Court’s approach to these documents, which is now well settled. It is sufficient to say that the statements are moving expressions of the effect upon the family of Ms Michael’s violent and untimely death. It is appropriate that the Court should acknowledge the family’s tragic loss and express to them its deepest sympathy. It has been necessary in these remarks to refer to some evidence which does not reflect creditably upon Ms Michael. I should emphasise that it is no part of my function to pass judgment upon her, and I would not presume to do so. That evidence was relevant only to an assessment of the offender’s criminality. 
     
      
    35 The offence of escaping from lawful custody is itself serious. While I am mindful of the emotional stressors which led to it, the fact remains that it was an abuse of a privileged classification by an offender who was serving a lengthy term of imprisonment for a very serious crime. Moreover, it was his intention to evade recapture by moving interstate. The sentence which I pass for that offence must be cumulative upon the minimum term to which he is still subject and, of course, I must assess that sentence and the sentence appropriate for the murder with an eye to totality. While the escape and the murder are clearly related, I have concluded that the sentence for the murder must itself be cumulative upon that imposed for the escape. 
     
      
    36 The sentence I propose for the escape is imprisonment for two years. I would not reduce that sentence because of the offender’s plea of guilty to that charge, which could be no more than a recognition of the inevitable. As he was at large for several days, I will need to be informed of the date upon which his existing minimum term is now to expire. I decline to set a non parole period because of the sentence which I propose for the murder. 
     
      
    37 Taking all relevant matters into account apart from the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea of guilty, I consider that the murder calls for a sentence in the order of twenty eight years. To recognise the utilitarian value of the plea I would reduce that sentence to twenty five years, a discount of a little over ten percent. Any greater reduction, in my view, would lead to a sentence which fails to reflect the gravity of the crime. As I have said, that sentence will commence at the expiration of the sentence for the escape. I find special circumstances, arising from the accumulation of sentences and the need for the offender to be subject to the sanction of parole for an extended period, and I would set a non-parole period of nineteen years. 
     
      
    38 I have now been informed by the Crown’s representative of the terminal date of the existing non-parole period, being 24 April, 2003. 
     
      
    39 Daniel Leslie Miles; on the charge of escaping from lawful custody you are sentenced to imprisonment for two years to commence on 25 April 2003. On the charge of murder you are sentenced to imprisonment for twenty five years to commence on 25 April, 2005. I fix a non-parole period of nineteen years in respect of that charge. You will be eligible for release on parole on 25 April, 2024.

      Judgment 
       
      NON-PUBLICATION ORDER IN RELATION TO COMPLAINANT’S NAME 
     1 HODGSON JA: On 21 February 2000 the appellant was indicted before Coolahan DCJ in the Newcastle District Court on four charges.  
      
       
     2 The first charge was a charge under s.112(2) of the Crimes Act that on or about 24 October 1996 he did break and enter the dwelling house of M at Bolton Point and then in the dwelling house committed a felony, namely sexual assault in circumstances of aggravation, namely he deprived M of her liberty.  
      
       
     3 There were then three charges under s.61J(1) of the Crimes Act, each in the same terms, namely that on or about 24 October 1996 at Bolton Point he had sexual intercourse with M without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, and at the time of the offence he threatened her by means of an offensive weapon to inflict actual bodily harm upon her. 
      
       
     4 The appellant pleaded not guilty and stood trial before Coolahan DCJ and a jury. On 25 February 2000 verdicts of guilty were delivered in relation to all four charges. On 17 May 2000 the trial judge sentenced the appellant in relation to each count to seven years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four and a half years to date from 24 February 2000, to be served concurrently. The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.  
      
       
     5 In the prosecution case evidence was given by the complainant, whose name was made subject to a non-publication order, that on 24 October 1996, after attending a concert, she returned to her home at Bolton Point where she lived alone. Her evidence was that when she had left earlier that day she had turned off the lights and closed all doors and windows. Upon arriving home, she noticed that lights were on inside, and when she went inside she saw that the dining room window was open. She was then attacked by a man, who used a knife in forcing her to submit to involvement in a series of particularly aggravated sexual acts, in circumstances where the attacker must have known she was not consenting. The attacker then tied the complainant’s wrists and feet, and was seen by the complainant to take a floral jewellery box containing imitation jewellery and put it into one of her bags, which she described as a black sports bag with zippers and a handle, and also to take a videotape and a packet of Christmas bonbons. 
      
       
     6 After the attacker left, the complainant was able to free her feet, and she went to the lounge room where she discovered that her telephone and answering machine and television and video recorder were gone. To seek help, the complainant ran across the road, still naked and with her hands tied, to a house occupied by Suzanne Main and Darren Corry. The police were called, and the complainant was taken to John Hunter Hospital. 
      
       
     7 At the hospital the complainant was examined by Dr Cheryn Palmer, who noted injuries consistent with the events described by the complainant. Dr Palmer gave evidence that she took a number of swabs, including a swab from the high vagina, which were rolled onto slides and which, together with ten mils of blood from the complainant, were placed into a sealed bag together with her notes, which was then placed into a locked refrigerator. 
      
       
     8 According to Detective Christian, the officer in charge of the investigation, on 4 February 1997 he collected this sealed bag, placed it into a locked refrigerator at Toronto police station and on 5 February 1997 he conveyed it to the Division of Analytical Laboratories where he handed it to Ms Carey Biggart. 
      
       
     9 The complainant’s evidence was that she did not get a clear look at the assailant: however, she said he was not disguised, had short hair and a spiky haircut, and was wearing a flannelette shirt, a tee-shirt and jeans.  
      
       
     10 Four days after the attack, the complainant was shown a number of albums with photographs, and she nominated one as a photograph of her assailant. This proved to be incorrect.  
      
       
     11 On 27 September 1997, the complainant was shown a video compilation which included an image of the appellant and she did not identify this image.  
      
       
     12 On 25 February 1998, Detective Christian and another detective spoke to the appellant, who agreed to provide a blood sample. He was accompanied to his nominated doctor’s surgery, where the sample was taken. Detective Christian gave evidence that he took this sample to Granville police station, where he prepared a specimen exhibit form, and then to the Division of Analytical Laboratories where he handed it to Ms Biggart.  
      
       
     13 Ms Biggart gave evidence that on 21 February 1997 Detective Christian handed her the sealed bag, which has also been called the sexual assault identification kit, and that she processed the items inside this kit. She said that semen was detected on some of the smears, including the high vaginal smear. The swabs were placed into a freezer room. She prepared two stain cards from the blood sample from the complainant, one was used for testing, and the other placed in a locked freezer. 
      
       
     14 Ms Biggart also gave evidence that on 25 February 1998 she received the appellant’s blood sample from Detective Christian, and from this prepared two stain cards which were dealt with as were the previous two stain cards. 
      
       
     15 Evidence was given by Rudolf Weigner, a forensic biologist at the division of analytical laboratories, to the effect that in about May 1998, following tests on the complainant’s blood sample, the high vaginal swab and the appellant’s blood sample being done under his supervision, and with his direct involvement in the case of the first of these, he interpreted the results of these tests. In respect of ten points of reference in the result from each sample, he said there was no difference between the DNA from the vaginal swab and the DNA from the appellant’s blood, but significant difference between both of these and the DNA from the complainant’s blood. He said that the particular DNA profile which was common to the vaginal swab and the appellant’s blood would be expected to be found in only about one person in 1.2 million people of the general population. 
      
       
     16 Evidence was also given by Robert Goetz, another forensic biologist at the division of analytical laboratories, that, apparently in about April 1999, he used what was called Profile Plus DNA analysis on nine markers in the DNA result from the vaginal swab and the appellant’s blood sample, and found no differences between them; and he said that the particular DNA profile would be expected to be found in no more than about one person in 3,600 billion people.  
      
       
     17 There was other lay evidence in the case.  
      
       
     18 Suzanne Main gave evidence that on the evening of 24 October 1996 she and her de facto husband Darren and their children went to a barbecue at the nearby home of Chris and Rachael Sing, where she was introduced to the appellant, who is Chris’s brother. Ms Main said the appellant had, at that time, really short hair in crew cut style. She said that during the evening Darren, Chris and the appellant left the house and returned later, and that at about 8.30pm she and Darren and the children left and walked home. She said the appellant came with them. She said that before she went to bed she saw Darren and the appellant looking at photo albums, and that after she went to bed she heard the front door close at about 11pm. She woke at about 1am and heard the complainant screaming, and she went down and saw the complainant and Darren inside their front doorway. 
      
       
     19 Rachael Sing gave evidence that on 24 October 1996 the appellant came to her home. She said she remembered Darren Corry being there, but not Suzanne Main, and she said there was no barbecue on that night. She said that in about mid-evening the appellant and Darren Corry left the house, and that she waited up to about 1.30am when the appellant returned. She said she saw him come from a bush track leading in the direction of the street where Darren Corry lived, and that he had a black bag with him which he did not have when he left, like a sports bag with a zipper and handles. She said the appellant told her he had broken into a house and that the lady had come home while he was there. She said that inside the black bag she saw jewellery, a video, Christmas decorations and some dildos and vibrators. In cross-examination she conceded she had lied to police in a statement made on 24 September 1997, and it was suggested to her that she gave evidence with a motivation to shift blame from her husband.  
      
       
     20 There was also evidence from Nicole Stewart, who had been in a relationship with the appellant for about five years up to 1995, and Alyssa Chamberlain, who had been in a relationship with the appellant in 1996.  
      
       
     21 Ms Stewart said that in August 1997 she saw a floral cardboard jewellery box in the appellant’s bedside drawer, and that subsequently the appellant said to her that he was in trouble for breaking into someone’s house and tying a woman up. Ms Chamberlain said that in about December 1997 the appellant said to her that he was involved in a break and enter in Newcastle in October, and that his brother had left him there. It was suggested in cross-examination to both these witnesses that they had motivation for giving evidence against the appellant.  
      
       
     22 The appellant made no admissions, gave no evidence at trial, and called no witnesses. The appellant relied on the following five grounds of appeal: 
      
       
        
         
         Ground 1: His Honour erred by admitting into evidence and by failing to withdraw from evidence the testimony of Rudolph Weigner and Robert John Goetz concerning the DNA test results. 
          
          
         Ground 2: His Honour inadequately warned the jury about the charges involved in assessing the evidence of Rudolph Weigner and Robert John Goetz when there was no evidence called from anybody who had conducted the DNA testing of the appellant's blood. 
          
          
         Ground 3: His Honour erred in directing the jury as to the elements of count one when he directed them that ""if you are satisfied that it was unlawful for him to get into the house then, as a matter of law that constitutes a breaking and entering. It does not have to be an actual smashing of windows. Any unlawful entry will constitute a breaking and entering"". 
          
          
         Ground 4: The verdict of the jury should be set aside because they are unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. 
          
          
         Ground 5: The sentences are too severe. 
         
        
       
     23 I will deal shortly with grounds 3 and 5. I deal with them together because Mr Boulten, for the appellant, conceded that ground 5 as to the severity of the sentence could only succeed if there was success on ground 3 relating to one of the charges.  
      
       
     24 Mr Boulten’s submission in relation to ground 3 was that the direction referred to in the ground misstated the law. He submitted that there had to be an actual or constructive breaking, and that this occurred only where the security of a house is infringed, and that it was not a breaking to further open a door or window which was partly open; and he referred to Walker (1978) 19 SASR 532 at 534, and Galea (1989) 46 A Crim R 158 at 161. Accordingly, the direction that “any unlawful entry will constitute a breaking and entering” was not correct. He conceded that leave was necessary pursuant to r.4, because the point was not taken below. He submitted that a misdirection as to the elements of an offence was so fundamental as to go to the root of the proceedings: see Wilde (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373.  
      
       
     25 The evidence of the complainant at the trial was that she had shut all doors and windows before leaving the house so that, if her evidence to that effect was accepted, there must have been a breaking and entering by the attacker unless some other person had first and independently opened a door or window through which the attacker has subsequently proceeded. Had a direction to that effect been sought below, there is no reason to suppose that a correct direction would not have been given.  
      
       
     26 It seems to me extremely unlikely that, had such direction been given, the result would have been any different; that is, extremely unlikely that the jury would either have not accepted the complainant’s evidence that she shut doors and windows or would have thought there was some reasonable possibility that some other person had independently of the attacker opened a door or window. In my opinion, in those circumstances, it would not be appropriate to grant leave to rely on this ground. 
      
       
     27 I turn now to grounds 1, 2 and 4, which I will deal with together.  
      
       
     28 At the trial, objection was taken to the evidence of Mr Weigner on the basis that the crucial DNA tests were not carried out by him but only, as he put it, under his supervision. A similar objection was taken when Mr Goetz was called. At the conclusion of the prosecution case, Counsel for the appellant sought an order that the DNA evidence be either withdrawn as inadmissible or else withdrawn pursuant to s.137 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
     29 I note that it was not specifically put by counsel at the trial that the evidence of Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz must be based on hearsay reports made to them, but that has been argued on appeal. I do not think specific leave is required under r.4 for that point to be taken, when clear objection was taken to the evidence generally.  
      
       
     30 In my opinion it is not completely clear whether or not the evidence of Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz involved hearsay or was based on hearsay. As I understand Mr Weigner’s evidence, it was to the effect that there were established procedures for testing samples which result in the production of print-outs of relevant parts of DNA, and that these print-outs can then be examined by persons such as Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz so as to determine whether two such print-outs record DNA which could be from the same person and, if so, what is the probability of a person selected at random of having DNA with the relevant characteristics displayed by the print-outs. In addition, the established procedures involved the production of intermediate print-outs which enable a person such as Mr Weigner to check that the matter is proceeding correctly.  
      
       
     31 Mr Weigner gave evidence that he instructed staff to carry out these procedures, and that he checked the intermediate print-outs to ensure that there were no errors. The evidence of the existence of procedures and the evidence of the giving of instructions is not itself hearsay. The question as to whether hearsay is involved, it seems to me, depends upon whether the procedures themselves involve persons making reports or representations in which they intend to assert that something is the case.  
      
       
     32 It seems to me to be probable that this must have happened, if only in order that the ultimate results of the tests be identified as relating to, in this case, the vaginal swab from the complainant and the blood sample from the appellant. It seems to me that the likelihood is that the print-outs which were analysed by Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz must themselves have contained the identification in question, or else must have been handed to them with the identification being reported by the person handing the print-outs to these people. If hearsay was involved in that way, it seems to me that, without the effect of that hearsay material, the position would be that the opinions of Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz would be irrelevant because not shown to relate to the samples taken from the complainant and from the appellant.  
      
       
     33 It might be argued that, even if hearsay is involved in this way, there could be a question, if the print-outs used carried the identification of the sources of the samples, they could be admissible as the basis of opinions expressed by the experts; and the identification of the sources could then be admissible as some evidence of their truth under s.60 of the Evidence Act. However it seems to me that that argument may have the fallacy identified earlier, namely that the admissibility of the opinion depends first on relevance, which in turn depends on the identification of the samples; and so the admissibility of the opinions cannot be used to establish the admissibility of the hearsay identification of the samples under s.60.  
      
       
     34 Whatever is the correct answer to the hearsay question, I think there is substance in the appellant’s complaint that to admit evidence like that of Mr Weigner and/or Mr Goetz over objection, without the evidence from the persons who actually carried out the procedures that resulted in the print-outs, and indeed without any evidence that there was any difficulty in calling these persons, involved unfair prejudice to the appellant. It may be that these persons would have no recollection of exactly what they did and would have to rely on records; but that is not generally sufficient justification for not calling, in a criminal prosecution, a witness involved directly in a significant part of the prosecution case.  
      
       
     35 Counsel for the appellant at the trial said he had an expert present in court for the purpose of assisting him with questions to be put to the persons who actually carried out the procedures, and I think this Court should proceed on the basis that there were relevant questions which the appellant’s counsel wished to put to these persons if they had been called. There is an obligation on the prosecution to call available witnesses of events alleged to constitute the offence and of essential parts of the prosecution case, at least unless there is some justification for not doing so: see for example R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279. I think this does extend to witnesses such as those in this case dealing with important links in the prosecution case. Particularly since DNA evidence can be so compelling, I do not think the matter of the correct carrying out of testing procedures should normally be proved, over objection, merely by evidence of the existence of the procedures and the giving of instructions, and otherwise left to inference. If for any reason the persons who actually did the work are unavailable, there may be justification for such a course. But there is no suggestion of that here.  
      
       
     36 For those reasons, even if the evidence of Mr Weigner and Mr Goetz were admissible, notwithstanding the possibility of hearsay, in my opinion it should have been excluded under s.135 or s.137 of the Evidence Act.  
      
       
     37 As mentioned before, there is no need in this case to obtain leave under r.4. However, Mr Dawe QC for the Crown has submitted that this is a case where the proviso should be applied. He submitted this on two grounds: first, that this Court could determine that the probability of error in the carrying out of the tests was so small that the appellant had not lost any realistic possibility of acquittal; and second, that, even without the DNA evidence, the prosecution case was so strong that no realistic possibility of acquittal had been lost.  
      
       
     38 If this Court were free to speculate about the matter, one might speculate that there is only a very small probability that there was error in the carrying out of the tests, or that a significant possibility of error could be demonstrated to a jury either by cross-examination or evidence. However, for reasons I have given, I think this was a serious gap in the prosecution case, and I do not think this Court should speculate about the matter. I do not think this Court can be certain that the appellant has not lost a realistic chance of either having the DNA material excluded, or at least significantly weakened.  
      
       
     39 As regards the other evidence in the case, I think that evidence would be sufficient to support a conviction, but I do not think it is sufficient to justify a conclusion that a conviction was inevitable or that there would not have been a reasonable possibility of acquittal, if that were the only evidence in the case. In my recounting of the evidence I have adverted to some inconsistency in the evidence of two of the most important of the witnesses, and there was challenge in cross-examination to some of the prosecution witnesses which may possibly have impressed a jury.  
      
       
     40 Accordingly, I do not think the Crown has established that the proviso should be applied.  
      
       
     41 The final question on which there has been debate is whether this is a case where a new trial should be ordered or a verdict of acquittal entered.  
      
       
     42 Mr Boulten submitted that the Crown was on notice, indeed prior to the trial, that it would be put to strict proof of all matters concerning the DNA material. The Crown made a forensic decision to run the trial without the evidence which this Court has now said to be required, and in those circumstances he submitted the appellant should not be subject, in effect, to the double jeopardy of a further trial. However, as I have indicated, in my opinion the other evidence in the case, apart from the DNA evidence, could support a conviction. The offences involved are extremely serious ones. There has been no previous decision which has dealt with the particular question which this Court has dealt with, and it appears that there has, up to this time, been a practice whereby the persons actually involved in the tests have not been called.  
      
       
     43 In all the circumstances I think the public interest does require that there be a new trial. It is unfortunate particularly that the complainant will be required to give evidence again at a trial, but on the whole I think this is what the public interest requires.  
      
       
     44 For the reasons I have given, in my opinion the appropriate order is that the appeal be allowed, the conviction quashed and that there be a new trial. 
      
       
     45 LEVINE J: I agree. I have nothing to add. 
      
       
     46 HOWIE J: I agree. In my view the unexplained failure of the Crown to call witnesses necessary in proof of a very significant part of the Crown’s case has deprived the appellant of the opportunity to test that part of the case before the jury. It also has deprived the Court of the opportunity to determine whether or not the evidence was admissible or whether it should be rejected in the exercise of discretion. Those two matters, in my view, lead to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice having occurred in this particular case, and therefore the convictions ought to be quashed.  
      
       
     47 I agree that the proper order to make is to order that the matter go for re-trial. 
      
       
     48 HODGSON JA: The orders of the Court are as I proposed.

      BRIAN WILLIAM FLEMING v ALAN LEWIS SEGAL 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff has commenced proceedings against the defendant, a solicitor who acted for him on the sale of a block of land in suburban Sydney. The defendant was also instructed, in conjunction with that sale, to attend to the removal of any right of carriageway that existed over an adjoining block of land, also owned by the plaintiff and which was to be retained by him, and that benefited the block of land that was to be sold. However, the defendant failed to remove all rights of way then in existence over that block. The property retained by the plaintiff remained burdened by a right of way in favour of the property sold; see Smouha v Fleming (NSWSC, Hodgson J, 20 May 1997). 
    2 The plaintiff maintains that the defendant was both in breach of the agreement arising from his retainer and negligent in failing to take such action as was necessary to bring about the extinguishment of the right of way. The plaintiff alleges that he suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant’s failure to carry out his instructions and seeks damages accordingly. 
    3 The defendant denies that he was negligent or in breach of contract in failing to remove the right of carriageway but asserts that in any event the proceedings are statute-barred by reason of the operation of s 14 of the Limitation Act 1969 (the Act). On 31 August 2001 Sperling J ordered, pursuant to Part 31 Rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, that there be a separate trial of the limitation issue: Fleming v Segal [2001] NSWSC 754. This is the matter that was argued before me. 
    4 Section 14 of the Act relevantly provides that an action founded on contract or tort cannot be maintained if brought after the expiration of the period of six years running from the date when the cause of action first accrues. The issue presently before the Court is, when did the present causes of action first accrue to the plaintiff? Because time runs from the date of breach of contract, which in this case is clearly outside the limitation period, the parties have argued the matter solely on the basis of the action in tort. It has been agreed that the cause of action accrued on the occasion when the plaintiff first suffered actual (and not potential or contingent) damage as a result of the conduct of the defendant: Wardley Australia Limited v State of Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 530-531; Scarcella v Lettice (2000) 51 NSWLR 302 at 306. For the purpose of determining this issue, the actual damage suffered must be “measurable”: Wardley at 531 or “beyond what can be regarded as negligible”: Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Limited [1963] AC 758 at 772. The limitation period can commence to run even though the plaintiff has not discovered or could not on any reasonable inquiry have discovered that damage has been sustained: Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 543, 560-561, 587-588, 598-602; Wardley at 540, 554-555, Registrar-General v Cleaver (1996) 41 NSWLR 713 at 719. 
    5 The particular matter for decision, therefore, is when the plaintiff first suffered damage as a result of the defendant’s failure to remove the right of carriageway that continued to burden the plaintiff’s property after the sale of the other block. The defendant maintains that damage first arose in 1987 when the property was sold without the right of way being extinguished. The plaintiff maintains that the cause of action did not arise until September 1994 when the purchaser of the property sold it to the present owners. The plaintiff commenced the current proceedings on 6 June 2000 and, therefore, they are statute-barred if the damage, which the plaintiff alleges he suffered, occurred before June 1994. 
    6 There is no significant dispute as to the facts. A Statement of Agreed Facts was admitted into evidence on behalf of the plaintiff without objection. That Statement has been supplemented by material tendered by both parties. There were some minor objections taken to certain parts of this material by the party not tendering it. As a result of those objections some parts of the documents tendered were not pressed and I have marked those parts accordingly. Where the tender was pressed over objection, it became unnecessary to resolve the issue because, sensibly, the parties were content for me to proceed on the material tendered without regard to the objections taken. 
    7 In light of the way the matter has been argued, the facts can be stated briefly. In May 1977 the plaintiff acquired a block of land on the waterfront of Double Bay at Point Piper (“Lot 1”). This property is a battle-axe block set behind another property that fronts Wolseley Road Point Piper (“Lot 2”). Access was gained from the substantial part of Lot 1 into Wolseley Road via a thin strip of land running from the corner of Lot 1 alongside the boundary of Lot 2. Lot 2 has no water frontage but access was gained from it to a jetty on Double Bay by a right of carriageway that ran alongside the boundary of Lot 1. This encumbrance on Lot 1 was created in favour of Lot 2 in 1971 by an instrument with the registration number, M 306169 (“the 1971 right of way”). At the same time, an easement for sewerage and drainage was also created for the benefit of Lot 2 over the same strip of land in Lot 1. 
    8 In 1976 a right of carriageway was created over both lots with the result that each property had access to both Wolseley Road and Double Bay. So far as Lot 1 was concerned, it was encumbered by a four-foot right of way extending along the strip of land from Wolseley Road and continuing down to Double Bay. This right of way was created by an instrument registered as P 236518 (‘the 1976 right of way”). 
    9 A set of stairs and an inclinator were built over the strip leading to Double Bay thus giving the owners of both properties access to the water. 
    10 In 1983 the plaintiff, jointly with his sister, purchased Lot 2. However, the existing tenants of the house on that property remained in occupation of it. In 1986 the plaintiff decided that Lot 2 would be sold and he retained the defendant to act on the sale and instructed him to extinguish all rights of access to Double Bay that existed over Lot 1 in favour of Lot 2. The plaintiff wished to protect his privacy on Lot 1 by denying access to Double Bay to the new purchasers of Lot 2.  
    11 Lot 2 was sold by auction. It was made clear to potential purchasers, both before and during the auction, that the property as sold would have no access to the waterfront of Double Bay. 
    12 In October 1986 the plaintiff and his sister entered into a contract for the sale of Lot 2 for $1.61 million. The contract contained a number of Special Conditions, number 11 of which (“SC11”) was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “ 
        Notwithstanding any other term or condition as herein contained the Purchaser acknowledges that the Vendors will be seeking the extinguishment of that right of carriageway 4 feet wide created by D.P. 547705 and instrument filed as No. M. 306169 appurtenant to the land. The Vendors shall do all things reasonably necessary to obtain such extinguishment on or before settlement  
        PROVIDED HOWEVER 
         that if the Purchaser is unable to obtain registration of such extinguishments on or before settlement then the Purchaser shall do all things necessary and sign all such documents as the Vendors may reasonably request to enable such extinguishment without cost to the Purchaser. This clause shall not merge on completion.” 
        
       
      
      
     It seems clear that the word “Purchaser” where it appears on the second occasion in that clause should read “Vendors”. 
      
    13 Lot 2 was sold to Mr Toltz. Settlement took place on 6 February 1987. On 13 May 1987 a transfer from the plaintiff and his sister to Mr Toltz was registered at the Land Titles Office. At the same time a Transfer Releasing Easement that extinguished the 1971 right of way was registered. 
    14 Nothing was done to extinguish the 1976 right of way either before or after the sale of the property. 
    15 In August 1989, after he had been informed that the four-foot right of way over Lot 1 still existed, the plaintiff asked the defendant whether any error had occurred during the sale of Lot 2. The defendant wrote to the plaintiff assuring him that no error had been made in relation to the extinguishment of any right of way burdening Lot 1. The defendant expressed some indignation at the suggestion that he had been negligent in that regard and complained of the time and money that had been expended in confirming that no error had in fact been made. 
    16 In April 1994 Mr Toltz informed the plaintiff that the right of way had not been removed and still appeared on his title. The plaintiff, no doubt relying upon what the defendant had told him, refused to accept the accuracy of this assertion. 
    17 In September 1994 Mr Toltz entered into a contract for the sale of Lot 2 with Mr Smouha and Ms Ho. 
    18 On 15 January 1996 the plaintiff again sought advice from the defendant as to whether Lot 1 was still burdened by a right of way in favour of Lot 2 extending to the Bay. On 3 July 1996 the defendant wrote to him re-asserting that no error had been made in 1987 and that no right of carriageway then affected the property. The defendant set out in some detail the reasons for that assertion but it is unnecessary for present purposes to specify the reasons he gave. 
    19 In July 1996 Mr Smouha and Mrs Ho commenced proceedings in the Equity Division of this Court to obtain a declaration that the right of carriageway created in 1976 still existed over Lot 1 for the benefit of their property. They were successful and Hodgson J made an order to that effect on 20 May 1997. 
    20 The plaintiff sold Lot 1 in 1999. As I have indicated, the present proceedings were commenced on 6 June 2000. 
    21 In the Statement of Claim filed by the plaintiff the particulars of the loss and damage suffered by the plaintiff are given as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Loss of value of Lot 1 
         
         (b) Loss of enjoyment of Lot 1 
         
         (c) Further particulars will be supplied in due course.” 
        
       
      
      
     On 29 November 2000 the plaintiff’s solicitors advised the solicitors for the defendant that the plaintiff intended to claim: 
      
       
        
        “a) loss of value of his property which will be the difference in its value burdened and unburdened by the right of accessway in September 1994 or March 1995; 
         
         (b) loss of enjoyment of his property; and 
         
         (c) costs of Equity Division proceedings and Court of Appeal proceedings of $55,171.08” 
         
        
       
      
     On 10 May 2001 the plaintiff’s solicitors advised the defendant that the plaintiff would rely upon the further particular: 
      
       
        
        “Loss of opportunity to obtain rectification of the Sale Agreement between the Plaintiff and Mr Toltz” 
        
       
      
    22 The defendant submits that any damage that was occasioned to the plaintiff by the failure to remove the right of way arose at a point of time outside the limitation period. It is submitted that the occasions upon which damage was suffered by the plaintiff could be identified as any or all of the following: 
     
      
       
       (a) 23 October 1986 when the plaintiff and his sister entered into the contract for the sale of Lot 2. Damage was suffered on that date because: either (i) Lot 2 sold for less than it would have fetched at auction had it been known that the right of way still existed giving access to Double Bay; or (ii) the contract entered into provided only for the extinguishment of the 1971 right of way and the plaintiff could not rely upon the SC11 in the contract to enforce the purchaser to co-operate in the later extinguishment of any other right of way. 
        
        
       (b) 14 May 1987 when the transfer of title to Mr Toltz and the transfer extinguishing the 1971 right of way were registered. The damage suffered at that time was that the plaintiff was left with an indefeasible right of way burdening Lot 1 in favour of Lot 2. 
       
      
      
       
       (c) August 1989 when the plaintiff was alerted to the fact that the right of way may not have been extinguished. 
        
         
        
       (d) 29 April 1994 when Mr Toltz informed the plaintiff that the right of way was still showing on his title. From this date the plaintiff knew that the owner of Lot 2 was claiming that the right of way still existed and, thereafter, was required to disclose this claim in any future sale of Lot 1. 
       
      
    23 The plaintiff denies that he suffered any such damage as the defendant alleges because until Mr Toltz sold the property, the plaintiff was able to enforce the removal of the right of way. The argument is that there was a common mistake made between the plaintiff and his sister, on one hand, and Mr Toltz, on the other, when Lot 2 was sold. It was erroneously believed that, after the sale, Lot 2 would not enjoy any right of way over Lot 1. This was the condition upon which Lot 2 was sold at auction and purchased by Mr Toltz. SC 11 was in the contract to ensure that this condition and the intention of the parties would be met. However SC11 did not represent the understanding and intention of the parties because it referred only to the 1971 right of way. The argument continues that this disconformity between the oral agreement resulting from the auction and the written contract entered into by the parties could have been rectified had the plaintiff been aware of the defendant’s omissions. Maralinga P/L v Major Enterprises P/L (1973) 128 CLR 336 at 343, 350-351, is relied upon to support this argument. It is noted that the 1971 right of way was not extinguished until 1987. It is submitted that Mr Toltz had a personal obligation to rectify the contract, that this personal obligation continued after settlement, and that the plaintiff, relying upon a rectified SC11, could have required Mr Toltz to execute a transfer extinguishing the 1976 right of carriageway had he become aware of its continued existence. 
    24 The argument proceeds that, when Mr Toltz contracted to sell the property in September 1994, the plaintiff lost the right to have the written contract with Mr Toltz rectified and SC11 specifically performed. Thereafter, the plaintiff was unable to have the 1976 right of way extinguished. The plaintiff contends that it was not until this date that damage was suffered because until this time any damage was contingent and it was only at this time that the contingency firmed into fact when the plaintiff lost the power to exercise his right to have the 1976 right of way extinguished under the contract of sale. It is submitted that, if the damage is the loss of a chance to enforce a right, damage accrues upon the expiry of any period in which that right could be exercised. Reliance is placed on Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis & Co [1989] VR 781 at 787 and Cheney v Duncan [2001] NSWCA 197 at [27]-[28] for that proposition. 
    25 The plaintiff submits that, until Mr Smouha and Ms Ho, the purchasers from Mr Toltz, obtained the declaration made by Hodgson J in May 1997, the plaintiff had no belief, or reason to believe, that the 1976 right of way had not been extinguished. It was noted that by letter dated 3 July 1996 the defendant denied that any right of way in favour of Lot 2 over Lot 1 remained. The plaintiff submits that in those circumstances he never suffered damage by the continued existence of the right of way until Mr Smouha and Ms Ho enforced it. 
    26 The application of the Act to proceedings arising from defects in title was most recently considered in Scarcella v Lettice, above. The Court of Appeal was concerned with the operation of the Act in a case of alleged professional negligence by a solicitor who acted in the purchase of a property in 1982. The purchasers believed that there was a right of way giving vehicular access to part of the property over two neighbouring properties. In 1994 they discovered that no right of way existed over one of the blocks and subsequently sued the solicitor who pleaded the defence based upon the provisions of the Act. The trial judge found that the solicitor was negligent in failing to obtain all searches required. He rejected the defence on the basis that the purchasers first suffered damage in 1994 when they discovered they did not have a right of way as they had previously believed. 
    27 On appeal it was held that the trial judge was in error in dismissing the defence. The Court of Appeal stressed that damage accrues even if the plaintiff is not aware of it. It was noted that, where an owner suffers loss because of latent defects in a building, the cause of action accrues when the defects become manifest or otherwise discovered and not before. This principle has been extended to cases involving latent defects in title, see Christopoulos v Angelos (1996) 41 NSWLR 700 and Registrar-General v Cleaver (1996) 41 NSWLR 713. In each of those cases, it was held that time did not begin to run under the Act until the purchasers discovered the defect in title because, until that time, they suffered no economic loss. In each case the defects would not have been discovered by normal conveyancing procedures. 
    28 However, the Court of Appeal distinguished the facts of the case before it from those two decisions on the basis that the defect in title was not a latent defect of the kind considered in those decisions. The purchasers in Scarcella v Lettice could never have sold the property without the defect being discovered by normal conveyancing procedures and, as a result of the discovery, they would have faced a claim either for compensation for the defect in title or for rescission of the contract. Handley JA, who gave the principal judgment of the Court, stated at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The general principle is that time runs from when the cause of action is complete, whether or not this is discovered or discoverable. The exceptions for latent defects in buildings, latent defects in title, and prospective and contingent losses are the only apparent exceptions to this general rule. They depend in each case on a finding that the particular form of economic loss had not been suffered when the Plaintiff became committed to the risk, but only later when the risk actually occurred”. 
         
        
       
      
    29 The plaintiff argues that Scarcella v Lettice can be distinguished from the facts in the present case, because there the purchasers acquired a property with an existing defect in title, which was discoverable by proper search, and as a result paid more than the property was worth. It is submitted that, unlike the present case, that damage was occasioned by settlement and the cause of action arose at that time. It is argued that because Mr Toltz could have been required to do what was necessary to extinguish the 1976 right of way had SC11 been rectified, the enhanced value of an unencumbered Lot 1 was not lost while the right to rectify and enforce SC11 remained. 
    30 The plaintiff argues that the situation in the present case was akin to that of the plaintiff’s in Christopoulos v Angelos and Registrar-General v Cleaver, to which I have referred above.  
    31 In Christopoulos v Angelos, above, the plaintiffs purchased a property without notice of an easement which affected the property but which was not recorded on their title. The Registrar-General recorded the easement some four years after the purchase. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs suffered economic loss on the date of the registration of the easement and not on the date of purchase of the property. The defect in title was not discoverable by normal search and inquiry. It was significant to the decision of the majority of the Court that, until the easement was recorded on the title, the plaintiffs could have sold the property for its value unaffected by the easement and, therefore, suffered no economic loss. 
    32 In Registrar-General v Cleaver, the Registrar-General, when registering a transfer severing the ownership of two blocks of land, had failed to note that one lot (Lot 1) was subject to a height covenant in favour of the other lot (Lot 2). Both lots changed hands without any person noting the defect in title of the subservient tenement. When the owners of Lot 1 indicated that they intended to build in breach of the covenant, the defect was discovered. The Registrar-General then noted the covenant on Lot 1 but later removed it following proceedings by the owners of that lot. The owners of Lot 2 then brought proceedings for damages under s 127(1) of the Real Property Act relying upon the loss of value in the property by the unenforceability of the covenant in its favour. The Registrar-General pleaded the defence under the Limitation Act. The defence failed and the Registrar-General appealed. On appeal it was held that the defence did not apply because the owners of Lot 2 suffered damage, not when they purchased the property but when the Registrar-General noted the covenant on their title. As in Christopoulos v Angelos, the defect in title was not discoverable by normal procedures. 
    33 Of course the present case is somewhat different from those that have been considered by the Court of Appeal and to which I have referred. This was not a case of the plaintiff purchasing a defective property and, as a result, suffering economic loss being the difference in the value of the property as purchased and that free of the defect that was later discovered. In such a case, unless the defect was latent in the sense as explained in the decisions of the Court of Appeal to which I have referred, the damage occurred at the time of purchase even though the defect had not been discovered. 
    34 However, putting the question of rectification aside and assuming that SC11 had not existed in the contract of sale between the plaintiff and Mr Toltz, it seems to me that the principles set out and applied in Scarcella v Lettice would require that the defence be upheld. In that case the omission of the solicitor, which allegedly resulted in economic damage to the plaintiff, was a failure to properly search the title of the property purchased and, as a result, a failure to identify that there was no right of way to the benefit of the property being purchased by the plaintiff. The defect in title was discoverable by normal conveyancing search and inquiry and, therefore, was not latent. Economic loss was suffered as soon as the purchase was complete because the property, as purchased, was of less value than the price the plaintiff paid for it. The limitation period under the Act, therefore, ran from the date of purchase not the date of discovery of the defect. 
    35 In the present case the value of Lot 1 was affected by the existence of the two rights of way on the title. The plaintiff instructed the defendant to remove any right of way when Lot 2 was sold. The defendant failed to comply with that instruction because, notwithstanding his search of the titles of the relevant properties, he omitted to identify the 1976 right of way and, therefore, to take appropriate steps to extinguish it. The defect was not latent, although it was unknown to the plaintiff, in that it could have been discovered by normal conveyancing search and inquiries once the notification of the right of way was understood and appreciated. In May 1987, when the transfer to Mr Toltz and the instrument extinguishing the 1971 right of way were registered, (disregarding for present purposes the existence of SC11) the plaintiff suffered economic loss in relation to Lot 1 because the property was of less value by reason of the defendant’s omission than it would have been had that omission not occurred. 
    36 I am unable to discern any difference in principle between the failure to identify a defect in title in Scarcella v Lettice and the failure in the present case. The omission in each case resulted in economic loss being occasioned to the plaintiff on completion of the relevant conveying transaction: in the former case, the purchase of the property and, in the present case, the sale of Lot 2 by the plaintiff. In each case the plaintiff was left in ownership of property with a defect in title. Absent any capacity in the present plaintiff to redress that position, the damage suffered by him as a result of the defendant’s omission was actual and not contingent. Lot 1 remained encumbered to the benefit of Lot 2. As in the case of Scarcella v Lettice, the plaintiff would have been met with the defect in his title whenever he came to sell the property. The fact that the defect might not have been discovered by a potential purchaser of Lot 1 does not lead to the conclusion that any damage to the plaintiff was prospective or contingent, see Scarcella v Lettice at [32] and [42]. 
    37 The question then is, does the existence of SC11 make any difference to that situation? The plaintiff argues that, prior to the sale of Lot 2 by Mr Toltz, he could have obtained rectification of SC11 to accord with the antecedent oral agreement between himself and Mr Toltz that Lot 2 was being sold without any access over Lot 1 to Double Bay. Once the contract was rectified, the plaintiff could have taken action to have Mr Toltz execute the necessary instrument to give effect to that agreement and to extinguish the 1976 right of way. The argument is that until the plaintiff lost this right, any damage was merely contingent. 
    38 There is no dispute that Lot 2 was sold to Mr Toltz on the clear understanding that it would have no access to the water over the plaintiff’s property. This is how the property was advertised for sale and the basis upon which it was sold at auction. There is material indicating that after the sale Mr Toltz sought to have the right of way remain, but the plaintiff was adamant that it should be extinguished in accordance with the understanding upon which Lot 2 was sold. It appears that after the sale Mr Toltz, who was a friend of the plaintiff, was allowed access to the water over the plaintiff’s property notwithstanding that both he and the plaintiff believed that no right of way existed. 
    39 Rectification of a contract will be granted where the written contract does not accurately represent an antecedent agreement or common understanding between the parties to the contract, which agreement or understanding existed up until the time the written agreement was entered into; Australian Gypsum Ltd and Plaster Co Ltd v Hume Steel Ltd (1930) 45 CLR 54 at 64; Maralinga Pty Ltd v Major Enterprises Pty Ltd (1973) 128 CLR 336 at 349. Before granting the relief the court must be satisfied that the term of the contract to be rectified was not intended to supplant or supplement a term of the antecedent agreement or understanding: Maralinga at 350. It is no bar to rectification that the antecedent agreement did not comply with statutory requirements such as the need for a contract for the sale of land to be in writing. Generally rectification is not available where there was a unilateral mistake made by one of the parties: Commission for the New Towns v Cooper [1995] Ch 259 at 277. 
    40 Rectification can be granted where the mistake concerns the legal effect of the words in the document rather than as to the actual words used: Bush v National Bank Ltd (1992) 35 NSWLR 390 at 407, although Hodgson J (as he then was), noted the difficulties of a practical nature which may attend an application for rectification in such a situation. But it is important to bear in mind that “Courts of equity do not rectify contracts; they may and do rectify instruments purporting to have been made in pursuance of the terms of contracts”: Mackenzie v Coulson (1869) LR 8 Eq 368 at 375.  
    41 In the present case, it is clear that the understanding of the parties, before the written contract was entered into, was that Lot 2 was being sold without the benefit of any existing right of way over Lot 1 and, further, that any existing right of way would be extinguished either before, or if necessary, after completion of the contract. SC11 was intended to be, and would have been understood as, a fail-safe to ensure that the necessary steps to achieve the understanding could take place after settlement, if the right of way had not been extinguished by that time. The error was that only one right of way was identified, that being described in SC11. It seems to me to be clear that both parties erroneously believed that the removal of that right of way would achieve the result intended by the original agreement. 
    42 This aspect of the case has centred on a dispute as to whether the plaintiff could have obtained rectification of SC11 and then required Mr Toltz to execute an instrument extinguishing the 1976 right of way. The defendant has argued that rectification was not open and Mr Toltz’s personal obligation arising under the contract related only to the 1971 right of way specified in SC11. 
    43 As I have indicated, SC11 was not really necessary to bring about the common understanding or intention between the parties. The plaintiff could simply have required that settlement not take place until the right of way was extinguished. SC11 seems to have been inserted into the contract merely to ensure that settlement was not delayed by the inability of the plaintiff to have the instrument extinguishing the right of way registered. I believe that there is a strong argument that the personal obligation of Mr Toltz to remove any right of way could have been enforced against him regardless of the need to rectify SC11. Mr Toltz ought not to be heard to assert against the plaintiff that he enjoyed a right of way over Lot 1 in light of the assumption upon which he purchased the property. However, this was not a matter which was canvassed before me and I am prepared to assume that rectification was necessary before this Court would have required Mr Toltz to carry out what action was necessary to ensure that the agreement between him and the plaintiff was put into effect. 
    44 I am of the opinion that, if rectification were necessary, the plaintiff could have obtained that relief at any time until Mr Toltz sold Lot 2. This could have been achieved by deleting the description of the particular right of way specified and inserting the word “any” before the words “right of carriageway”. As amended in that way, and after correcting the wrong use of the word “Purchaser” clause SC11 would read: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Notwithstanding any other term or condition as herein contained the Purchaser acknowledges that the Vendors will be seeking the extinguishment of any right of carriageway appurtenant to the land. The Vendors shall do all things reasonably necessary to obtain such extinguishment on or before settlement  
        PROVIDED HOWEVER 
         that if the Vendors are unable to obtain registration of such extinguishments on or before settlement then the Purchaser shall do all things necessary and sign all such documents as the Vendors may reasonably request to enable such extinguishment without cost to the Purchaser. This clause shall not merge on completion.” 
        
       
      
    45 It appears to me that, if the plaintiff had sought rectification of SC11 there was no basis upon which it could be opposed by Mr Toltz or would have been refused by the Court. It would have been unconscionable for Mr Toltz to benefit from the omission to specify the 1976 right of way in SC11 when he purchased Lot 2 on the clear understanding that any right of way then existing was to be extinguished. The fact that both he and the plaintiff erroneously believed that there was only one right of way in existence cannot alter the nature of their agreement or their understanding as to what was being sold by the plaintiff and purchased by Mr Toltz. 
    46 It has been submitted on behalf of the defendant that, even if the plaintiff were able to seek rectification of SC11 or otherwise require Mr Toltz to assist in the extinguishment of the existing right of way prior to the sale of Lot 2, it did not follow that he suffered no damage prior to that time. It was argued that the plaintiff had no right to have the contract rectified or the right of way extinguished. As I understand the argument, it was that, although the plaintiff had a right under SC11 in respect of the 1971 right of way, he had no such right in respect of the 1976 right of way. Thus he suffered damage, even if at the end of the day Mr Toltz of his own volition or by order of the Court might have extinguished the right of way. It was submitted that the plaintiff’s position after the settlement of the sale to Mr Toltz was analogous to that of the plaintiff in Doundoulakis v Sdrinis [1989] VR 781, that is the position of a person who has a lesser right after the expiration of a limitation period than he, or she, had before. The operation of the Limitation Act itself takes away the right of a person. In that case it was held that the negligent impairment of a right or remedy can sound in damages:  
    47 I do not find the analogy a sound one. It seems to me that, until Mr Toltz sold Lot 2, the plaintiff was in the position where he could seek to have him execute the necessary instrument to have the existing right of way extinguished either by relying on rectification or equitable estoppel. He suffered no economic loss following the defendant’s failure to remove the right of way because he could take action to correct the consequence of the failure. In my opinion the present facts are distinguishable from those considered in Scacella v Lettice because the plaintiff had the means, aided by the Court if necessary, to correct the defect in his title caused by the omission by the defendant. The plaintiff would suffer economic loss only if, and when, those means were frustrated, such as when Mr Toltz sold Lot 2 to a purchaser without notice. 
    48 I acknowledge that the plaintiff by reason of the failure to remove the 1976 right of way was left with a block of land which was not as valuable as it would have been had the right of way been removed. But, in my view, he suffered no actual damage from that circumstance alone, either by way of economic loss or otherwise, while he possessed the means to have the defect remedied by taking action, if necessary, against Mr Toltz. Had he utilised those means, then I cannot see how Mr Toltz could have avoided his moral and legal obligation arising from the contract between them. To the extent that the plaintiff may have been damaged by the defendant’s conduct, that damage was merely prospective or contingent until Mr Toltz sold Lot 2. 
    49 In my view the defence based upon the Act fails and is dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      Extempore 
       
      [2002] NSWIRComm 220 
     1 This matter concerns a prosecution by Inspector Bruce Dowling of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, of Tieback Pty Limited (ACN 002716165) (the defendant) alleging a breach of s15(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983. The prosecution is continued, after the passage of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000, by the operation of cl13, Div 3 of Sch3 of the Savings and Transitional Provisions of that Act.2 The matter concerns an accident which occurred on 10 November 1999 at 68 to 72 Evaline Street, Campsie, during the course of the defendant erecting a smoke wall as part of the refurbishment of a Woolworths store at that location. Mr Greg Krivoshev, an employee of the defendant at that time, fell through a ceiling to a concrete floor whilst carrying out work on behalf of the defendant in the construction of the wall.3 The matter commenced by an application for an order pursuant to s4 of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967. An order was made under that section on 13 November 2001.4 The charge contained in the application was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        ""It is alleged that the Defendant, Tieback Pty Limited (ACN 002 786 165), an employer, breached Section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 
         on 10 November 1999, at premises located at 68-72 Evaline Street, Campsie in the State of New South Wales (""the premises"") in that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees at work, in particular, Greg Krivoshev, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system of work that was safe and without risks to health for the installation of a smoke wall in the ceiling of the premises between the store and warehouse (""the works"")."" 
        
       
     5 The particulars of the charge were as follows:  
      
       
        
        ""Particulars of the Defendant's breach are: 
         
          
          (a) It failed to conduct an adequate risk assessment prior to carrying out the works; 
           
          (b) It failed to provide adequate health and safety induction training to employees carrying out the works; 
           
          (c) It failed to ensure that its employees received adequate information concerning the works; 
           
          (d) It failed to ensure an adequate system of fall protection for employees carrying out the works; 
           
          (e) It failed to ensure that employees were adequately supervised whilst carrying out the works; 
           
          (f) As a result of the Defendant's failure, Greg Krivoshev received serious injuries."" 
          
         
        
       
     6 A statement of agreed facts was admitted into evidence by consent in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        (1) At all material times the Prosecutor was an Inspector appointed under Division 1 of Part 5 and empowered by Section 106 of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 
         to institute proceedings in this matter (or in the alternative an Inspector appointed under Division 4 of Part 3 and empowered by Section 48 of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 
          
        to institute proceedings in this matter). 
         
        (2) It is the Prosecutor’s belief, based on information provided to him by solicitors PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal, that the operation of Clause 13, Division 3 of Schedule 3, the Savings and Transitional provisions of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 
          
        (‘The Act’), in respect of offences committed against the former Act before its repeal or in respect of any related matter that continues to have force or effect and applies whether any such proceedings are pending on the repeal of the former Act or whether such proceedings are instituted after the repeal. 
         
        (3) The Prosecutor has conducted investigations into the circumstances surrounding an accident which occurred on 10 November 1999 at 68-72 Evaline Street, Campsie in the State of New South Wales (‘the premises’) and from those investigations he is able to state the following either from his own knowledge or upon information and belief. 
         
        (4) At all material times the Defendant Tieback Pty Limited (ACN 002 786 165) was an incorporated company with its registered office at 15 Beatrice Street, Auburn in the State of New South Wales. 
         
        (5) At all material times the Defendant: 
         
          
          (a) employed Leonid Chuproff as a manager, Trent Nathan Wooldridge as a labourer and Greg John Krivoshev as a plasterer; 
           
          (b) was conducting at the Woolworths refurbishment project at 68-72 Evaline Street, Campsie in the State of New Wales (‘the premises’) which involved constructing a smoke wall between the store and the warehouse in the ceiling area of the premises; 
           
          (c) contracted with Mark Anthony Shigelski and MSG Carpentry Pty Limited. 
          
         
        (6) On 10 November 1999 Greg Krivoshev, a labourer and plasterer (‘Krivoshev’) sustained serious injuries when he fell through a ceiling to the concrete floor of at least 4.18 metres below where he was working. Krivoshev suffered bruising to his left ankle, right heel, left knee, a fractured elbow, pain in his left wrist, back injury and later experienced dizziness and severe headaches. 
         
        (7) As a result of the Prosecutor’s investigations in this matter, he concluded as follows: 
         
          
          (a) At the time of the accident Krivoshev was being assisted by Trent Woolridge, Matthew Griffin and Mark Shigelski in the construction of a smoke wall between the store and warehouse in the ceiling area at the premises. 
           
          (b) The area at the premises in which Krivoshev was working was extremely difficult to gain access to and move about in. Krivoshev had to climb over the top of timber joists in order to gain access to the work area which was located in the ceiling cavity. Villaboard sheets measuring approximately 1.2 metres by 3.6 metres x 9mm thick (‘the villaboard’) were lifted up with a scissor lift to the work area. Shigelski and Krivoshev then had to move the villaboard about the work area and negotiate various obstructions to place the villaboard into position. Krivoshev was standing on a bulkhead at the time of this process being carried out. Krivoshev, while trying to manoeuvre a sheet of villaboard into place with the assistance of Shigelski, put his end of the villaboard down to secure his footing as he was walking on top of the joist. It was during this process that Krivoshev fell through the suspended ceiling to the floor of at least 4.18 metres below. 
           
          (c) Plywood sheets had been laid across some joists to form a false floor along the length of the wall however the floor was incomplete in places where there were duct work and other obstructions protruding through the bulkhead. 
           
          (d) There was a scissor lift for the movement of materials and for the workers to access the work area in the ceiling. 
           
          (e) Krivoshev was treated at the site by ambulance paramedics and allowed to continue with his work on the day. 
           
          (f) As a result of the accident Krivoshev suffered bruising to his left ankle, right heel, left knee, a fractured elbow, pain in his left wrist and a back injury.  
           
          (g) Krivoshev over the next few weeks developed back pain and severe headaches which were later attributed to his accident. 
           
          (h) Apart from the plywood sheeting referred to in paragraph 7(c), there was no system of fall protection in place which would have prevented a person falling through the ceiling to the floor below. 
           
          (i) There was a temporary walkway or platform from the scissor lift to the work area however there were no handrails or safety harnesses provided to employees. 
           
          (j) There were no written systems of work in place for persons working at heights and there was no adequate risk assessment carried out by the Defendant for the work being undertaken. 
           
          (k) There was no training provided to employees working at heights nor could the company provide any documentation that would indicate any training of any description had been provided for any procedure. 
           
          (l) The Defendant failed to provide adequate supervision to its employees whilst working in a hazardous environment without a suitable fall protection system being in place. 
           
          (m) Since the accident the Defendant has embarked upon developing policies, systems and procedures for all tasks that employees may have to carry out on site. Additionally the systems will be documented and training provided to all employees who work for the Defendant. 
           
          (n) Another strategy that the Defendant indicated would be utilised is that all sub-contractors carrying out work for the Defendant will have to produce documented method statements, systems of work and risk assessments before they are allowed to commence work on projects. The Defendant also indicated that it would be scrutinising various full arrest systems for fall protection that would be suitable to use in conjunction with training program. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (8) The Defendant, Tieback Pty Limited (ACN 002 786 165), an employer, breached Section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 
          
        on November 1999 at the premises located at 68-72 Evaline Street, Campsie in the State of New South Wales (‘the premises) in that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, in particular Greg Krivoshev, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system of work that was safe and without risks to health for the installation of a smoke wall in the ceiling of the premises between the store and warehouse (‘the works’). Particulars of the Defendant’s breach are: 
         
          
          (a) It failed to conduct an adequate risk assessment prior to carrying out the works. 
           
          (b) It failed to provide adequate health and safety induction training to employees carrying out the works. 
           
          (c) It failed to ensure that its employees received adequate information concerning the works. 
           
          (d) It failed to ensure an adequate system of fall protection for employees carrying out the works. 
           
          (e) It failed to ensure that employees were adequately supervised whilst carrying out the works. 
           
          (f) As a result of the Defendant’s failure, Greg Krivoshev received serious injuries. 
          
         
        
       
     7 In addition to the agreed statement of facts, the prosecutor tendered four colour photographs. The defendant relied in mitigation upon the evidence of Mr Leonid Chuproff, the manager of the defendant. There was no contest in the evidence that the work site presented difficulties of access, including the fact that the roof cavity where the work was performed contained air conditioning ducts, pipes, fittings and other obstacles, and that the work was carried on at a considerable height (above four metres). There was not any dispute that an assessment had been made of the site by the defendant before commencing work and it was decided to lay plywood sheets on top of the bulkhead to form a walk way and partial false floor. Further, it was agreed that the sheeting so laid (which did not cover the entirety of the ceiling or the work space) would not prevent the risk of the workers falling through the ceiling (which was a suspended ceiling). Indeed, Mr Lee, solicitor, who appeared for the defendant, conceded, properly in my view, that there was no arrangement in place as would eliminate that risk. I say properly in this context having regard at least to paragraph 7 (h) of the statement of agreed facts.8 There was a dispute on the evidence as to whether or not the mechanism suggested by Inspector Dowling to eliminate the risk of falling were capable of installation or potential use. The Inspector gave evidence that the following systems would have eliminated the risk of falling: 
      
       
        
        (1) A safety harness system described in the agreed statement of facts as a fall, arrest system; 
         
        (2) A system of railings or the like accompanying the plywood flooring and 
         
        (3) The erection of scaffolding. 
        
       
     9 I do not consider that, on the evidence, the last of these three alternatives really offered, in the circumstances of this project, a viable risk avoidance system. However, I consider the other systems were available to prevent the risk occasioned by the defendant. I have formed this view having regard to the Inspector's evidence. He has a wealth of experience and qualifications in this area. I have made allowance for him not having directly examined the site, but he was assisted in his considerations by access to the agreed statement of facts and relevant photographs. On balance, when taken with the cross-examination of Mr Chuproff, I prefer the Inspector's evidence in this respect, to the extent of any conflict. 10 In any event, the penalty to be imposed must be assessed by reference to the offence (which in this matter is particularised in paragraph 8 of the agreed statement of facts) as charged. It is the risk of injury, rather than the cause of the accident or the mechanisms which may be taken or put in place to avoid it, that is the primary consideration in the assessment of culpability.11 I have had regard to the submissions made by the prosecutor and the defendant in this matter. There does not appear to be any serious controversy in those submissions as to issues of fact or principle. I will not, therefore, endeavour to summarise them, but I am grateful for the assistance provided to the Court in that regard.12 As to general principles, I adopt my recent statement of them in Inspector Jose Barbosa v Newstart 150 Pty Ltd trading as Stylewise Interiors [2002] NSWIRComm 64 at [61] - [63], and emphasise that the primary factor to be considered when determining the appropriate sentence under the Act is the objective seriousness of the offence, that is, the nature and quality of the particular offence charged.13 Subjective factors which mitigate the seriousness of the offence must be taken into account. In this case, I consider there are considerable factors of that kind weighing in favour of the defendant. 14 The risk to safety occasioned by the defendant in this matter is the risk that a worker may fall while manoeuvring 'Villaboard' in the roof cavity where there is inadequate protection against falling. There was, in my view, an inadequate system for preventing an employee falling from a substantial height and, therefore, incurring serious injury.15 The offence is, in my view, a serious one. I have reached that view having regard to the failures identified at paragraph 8 of the statement of agreed facts. However, what is of paramount consideration is the failure to provide any or sufficient fall protection of the means identified by Inspector Dowling with respect to safety harnesses, safety railings or the provision of adequate covering of the subject area by plywood sheeting. Those risks were obvious and foreseeable. They were capable of remedy, such as by a fall/arrest system, which was well-known and available in the industry and, ultimately, in due course, pursued and acted upon by the defendant after the accident.16 The defendant made a risk assessment in this matter and, in many respects, in that regard, realised the actual dangers occasioned by the work in question, but took remedial steps which were well short of adequately preventing the risk of falling.17 The duty to prevent risk under the Act, as properly submitted by Mr Docking of counsel, who appeared for the prosecutor, is pro-active. The system of work chosen in this case was plainly inadequate and that is a factor which must also be taken into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.18 I also note the circumstances of the accident. The risk of serious injury from a fall at a substantial height is relevant as a manifestation of the gravity of the potential risk to safety, flowing from the breach and the culpability of the defendant. (See Newstart, at [95]).19 I note finally as to the objective features that the maximum penalty is $550,000 and general deterrence is an applicable consideration. (Capral Aluminium Ltd v Workcover Authority of NSW (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [71] to [80]).20 With respect to general deterrence I have particularly paid regard to the inherent dangers of work in the construction industry (and more particularly, the performance of work at a height in that industry) and the Construction Safety Regulations.21 I turn to the consideration of specific deterrence. In my view, and having regard to the decision in Capral Aluminium, specific deterrence is an applicable consideration in this matter, although it will be a reduced one because of the evidence that the defendant has moved into a state of relative inactivity in relation to the construction industry, and what appears to be the diminishing financial returns to the defendant as a result of that determination, accompanied, it would appear, by the retirement of the principals of the defendant.22 I now turn to the consideration of the particular subjective features in this matter. In my view, there are quite significant subjective features, as earlier referred to, which should result in a substantial discounting of penalty. Those factors may be summarised as follows: 
      
      1. The plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity and, with respect to the plea of guilty, I have formed the view that the defendant is both contrite and demonstrating substantial remorse. 
      
      
      2. As was conceded by the prosecutor, the defendant has provided the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales with substantial cooperation: 
      
      
      3. The defendant has no prior criminal history, and significantly, despite a considerable period of operation, has not been known to the Court. In short, I consider that the defendant has demonstrated itself to be a good industrial citizen from a safety vantage point under this Act. 
      
      
      4. I have had regard to the steps taken by the defendant after the incident which are referred to in paragraph 7 of the agreed statement of facts. 
      
      
      5. A factor which I consider to be of considerable importance is that the defendant offered assistance to the injured worker following the accident. 
     23 There is one final matter that I should attend to prior to considering the sentence appropriate in this matter. That question concerns the financial means of the defendant.24 The relevant considerations in this respect, as a matter of principle, are to be found in my judgment in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Farrell) v Schrader (2002) IR 284 (commencing at [83]).25 The evidence in this respect is not entirely satisfactory. It falls to the defendant in proceedings such as these to provide evidence as to its financial means if the defendant wishes to have that factor taken into account in sentencing. However, on balance, and having regard to the affidavit of Mr Chuproff (and the cross-examination of him), I consider that a case has been made out demonstrating the lack of financial means of the defendant.26 I am satisfied that the defendant has relevantly a turnover of less than $500,000 throughout the most recent history of the company, which turnover has diminished to a point reflecting the company's relative inactivity. In that result, I will, as it were, give full effect to that consideration in the assessment of penalty.27 The Court is required in these proceedings to make an assessment of costs: WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Dawson) v Plastachem Pty Ltd (2001) 110 IR 351. I note, in that respect, the prosecutor applied for costs. The application was not resisted, and the quantum of costs was agreed at the sum of $6,000. I note as well that the prosecutor applied for moiety of the penalty in this matter which application was not opposed.28 Having regard to the objective features of this matter and, further having regard to the various subjective features earlier referred to, I consider that the penalty in this matter should be $35,000. I have allowed the defendant, having regard to R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, a discount of 25 per cent in relation to the relevant subjective features. 29 In the result, I make the following orders: 
      
      1. The defendant is fined in the amount of $35,000 with moiety thereof to the prosecutor. 
      
      
      2. The defendant shall pay the prosecutor the sum of $6,000 as costs of the proceedings.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
         
       
     1 THE COURT: The applicant has filed a notice of appeal against his conviction in the District Court on 28 February 1994, upon an indictment charging him with one count of indecent assault. By reason of the circumstance that this notice was not filed until 25 September 2001, he requires an order of this Court for an extension of time within which the appeal may be lodged: s10(1) and (3) Criminal Appeal Act (NSW) 1912. 
      
       
     2 In order to determine whether such extension should be granted, it is necessary to review the circumstances in which the conviction came to be recorded, as well as the subsequent history of the proceedings. The material before the Court reveals in this regard that: 
      
       
        
       (a) The Crown case presented against the appellant was that between 31 August 1990 and 1 November 1990 at Wyoming, he touched the victim (MK) on the vagina from outside her clothing, during a game of hide and seek.  
        
        
       (b) It was also asserted by the Crown that during the course of playing the same game he committed identical offences in relation to two other young girls (LC and LK). 
        
        
       (c) Each offence was alleged to have occurred after he had invited the three girls into the premises where he was living with his parents, having offered them food and drink.  
        
        
       (d) Initially the appellant appeared for trial on 9 August 1993 before His Honour Judge Urquhart DCJ, in answer to an indictment charging offences separately concerning each of the three girls; that trial was, however, aborted when one of the complainants disclosed that she had kept a diary from which she had been able to calculate or determine the day on which the offences were committed. 
        
       
     (e) Prior to the date of this trial, particulars had been properly sought by the defence in order to obtain more particularity as to the possible date of the offences, and subpoenas had been issued to various nursing homes in order to establish whether the appellant might have had an alibi arising out of his practice of travelling to Sydney, and to Newcastle, to visit relatives at such homes. The production of a diary entry narrowed the date of the alleged offences to 7 October 1990, and it was upon the application of the appellant, in order to allow this date to be further explored, that the jury was discharged and the trial adjourned. The appellant now somewhat surprisingly suggests that he was improperly pressured into consenting to this adjournment, which, on any view, was properly sought.  
      
       
        
       (f) The appellant then appeared before his Honour Judge Patten DCJ in the District Court at Gosford on 28 February 1994, at which point his Honour was informed that the parties sought a sentence indication upon the basis that there would be a plea of guilty to one count (involving MK), with the other two matters being taken into account on a Form 2. His Honour had placed before him, by consent, a statement of facts, the antecedents of the appellant, the statements of the girls, a letter from the mother of MK, and a letter from a Salvation Army Officer. This last mentioned document was tendered on behalf of the applicant. The circumstances in which this hearing was sought were in issue in so far as the appellant said that it occurred without his consent. Rather, he said, it arose out of a unilateral request made by the Crown over his opposition.  
        
        
       (g) To resolve this issue, it is necessary to refer to the evidence which was led from the solicitor from the Legal Aid Commission, and from counsel who had instructions to appear for the appellant. Their account of events sharply contradicted that of the appellant, and it was corroborated by written and signed instructions concerning the holding of a sentence indication hearing (Exhibit 1). In summary, their evidence, which we would accept in preference to that of the appellant, shows that on the morning of 28 February, the Crown Prosecutor raised with defence counsel, the possibility of the Crown’s accepting a plea of guilty to one count, with the other two matters being dealt with on a Form 1. This was discussed with the appellant who gave a written instruction, initially in terms that he did not accept the Crown offer. 
        
        
       (h) Some little time later, defence counsel and the Legal Aid solicitor said, the appellant indicated to them that he would like to reconsider the option of receiving a sentence indication, the procedure for which had been explained to him. He then gave signed, written instructions, added to the end of Exhibit 1, to the effect that he had reconsidered his position, and that he would like a sentence indication hearing to be sought on his behalf. In the light of these instructions, which were signed by the appellant, and in the light of the evidence of trial counsel and the Legal Aid solicitor, we would reject the appellant’s evidence to the effect that the sentence indication hearing was held contrary to his will and wishes, or that its nature was not understood by him.  
        
        
       (i) When the matter came before his Honour Judge Patten, he gave an indication, after a consideration of the material placed before him, that the sentence which would be imposed for the offence on the indictment, taking into account the Form 1 matters, would be one of periodic detention for 9 months. He stood the proceedings down to allow the appellant time to take instructions and to consider his position. 
        
        
       (j) Again, there is a sharp issue between the appellant and his parents on the one hand, and his legal representatives on the other hand, as to what occurred at this point of the day’s proceedings. It was the appellant’s account that either his counsel or solicitor said to him in the course of a discussion, in the presence of his parents: - 
        
         
          
         “ 
         Hey mate, you are getting a fantastic deal. It is only weekend detention. Cop it sweet, plead guilty 
         ” 
          
          
         
        
       He said that he also specifically remembered the solicitor saying:- 
        
         
          
         “If you do not plead guilty you will never get Legal Aid again.” 
          
          
         It was his account that pressure was continuously placed upon him, that he was unable to control his lawyers, and that at the end he submitted, and agreed to enter a guilty plea. At this point he said he had remarked: - 
          
          
         “Stuff it, I will follow your legal advice and plead guilty”;  
         
         
          
         This, he said, was because although he had repeatedly claimed that he wanted his trial, and wanted it on, they would not give it to him. 
         
        
        
       (k) The evidence given by his parents did not assist the appellant to any great degree. While his mother described the atmosphere in the legal room as hostile and upsetting, she was somewhat vague as to what was actually said by the appellant and his legal advisers. She did say, however, that the appellant was asserting that he was “ 
       not going to plead anything but not guilty. 
       ” His father similarly described the ambience as intense, and said that counsel was repeatedly saying “ 
       accept the sentence indication or do 3 to 5 years, and you won’t survive” 
       . This is an observation which the appellant did not mention, even though it could hardly have been forgotten had it been said. Additionally, it was his account that the Legal Aid solicitor had said “ 
       if you sack us you will never get Legal Aid again 
       ”. Again, this is an observation which is very different in its terms from the version offered by the appellant. 
        
        
       (l) The account of the appellant’s legal representatives we would accept as truthful and accurate. It was corroborated by the written instructions which were prepared and then signed by the appellant. It was their account that, after discussing the sentence indication, the appellant originally gave a written instruction (Exhibit 2) to the effect that he intended to plead not guilty, and asked his legal advisers to seek leave to adduce alibi evidence, even though he had not advised them of a specific alibi before 28 February. Counsel said that he had informed the Crown Prosecutor that the matter would proceed as a trial, and arrangements were thereafter made to place the matter before his Honour Judge Maguire, who was also sitting in the District Court that day. 
        
        
       (m) A little while later, counsel said, the appellant indicated that he would like some more time and advice in relation to the matter. Counsel replied that he would arrange for that to be done, and he suggested that the appellant arrange for his parents to come to the Court. After they arrived, he said that he discussed the “ 
       ins and outs 
       ” of the case in their presence, in the course of which he explained the effect of the sentencing indication, pointed to possible outcomes in a trial, and expressed his opinion as to the strength of the Crown case.  
        
        
       (n) Counsel and the Legal Aid solicitor each said there were no threats made or voices raised, and that they discussed the matter properly and civilly, and without any pressure being placed upon the appellant to enter a plea of guilty. 
        
        
       (o) They also said that it was not until 28 February that the appellant had suggested that he had definitely been in Newcastle on 7 October 1990, that being the date nominated by the victim, after consulting her diary, as the day of the offence. As a consequence, no notice of alibi had been given as required, it being material in that regard that the records of the Newcastle nursing homes which the appellant had earlier said he had visited from time to time had been investigated for possible entries showing his presence there, without success. It was in those circumstances they said, that the appellant had been advised that he could not give any positive evidence in support of an alibi, and that there was a risk of the Crown prosecutor’s relying on a late offer of an alibi for 7 October as a recent invention which had potential adverse consequences for his case.  
        
        
       (p) Following these various discussions, they said that the appellant gave instructions which were again reduced to writing and signed by him, to enter a plea of guilty to one count, with the other two matters being taken into account on the Form 1. Those instructions were to the following effect: - 
        
        
         
         “ 
         I instruct my legal advisers that I intend to plead guilty to charges of commit act of indecency on one indictment (three charges) and two on a Form 2. 
         
        
        
         
         I understand by pleading guilty I am admitting the offence/s that is: I accept what the girls say is correct even though I have no real memory of the incident. I had been drinking heavily at the time and understand I may have suffered some brain damage as a result of alcohol consumption. 
         
        
        
         
         The consequences of plea/s of guilty has been fully explained to me. That is, I am aware that as a result of a sentence indication hearing that I will get 9 months periodic detention. 
         
        
        
         
         No inducement has been held out to me to plead guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         I am aware that should I indicate a plea of guilty and wish to vary it, then my present legal advisers will have to withdraw it.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
       (q) Thereafter, the appellant appeared before his Honour Judge Maguire and entered a plea of guilty to the count in the indictment. The matter was then stood over for the appellant to reappear before his Honour Judge Patten for sentencing.  
        
        
       (r) The appellant duly appeared before his Honour Judge Patten that day, and after adhering to his plea he was, on the basis previously noted, sentenced to 9 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention.  
        
        
       (s) The Legal Aid solicitor said that, after the various documents were prepared in relation to his entry into periodic detention, the appellant said that he wanted to appeal because he thought that the sentence was too severe. She made an appointment for him to attend at her office on 1 March, at which time she would help him prepare an appeal form and explain the procedure for seeking bail. In due course, with her assistance, a notice of appeal against sentence was prepared and filed, and an application was made for Legal Aid. That application for Legal Aid was later refused on 25 March 1994.  
        
        
       (t) Notwithstanding, on 6 April 1994 the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal against the sentence. His application was called over by the registrar on various dates, but on 8 August 1994 it was summarily dismissed by the Court for want of prosecution. 
        
        
       (u) The sentence of periodic detention was thereafter fully served by the applicant.  
        
        
       (v) On 24 September 1996 the appellant received an order requiring that he give restitution in the sum of $6000.00 in respect of compensation which had been awarded to the victim MK (in the amount of $8000.00). Although he did not give any evidence in this regard, the appellant put to the Legal Aid solicitor that the question of Victim’s Compensation had never been brought to his notice. She gave evidence to the contrary of that, indicating that in the course of the initial instructions on 6 January 1993 she had expressedly advised him of the victims’ entitlement to claim compensation. His reply, she said, was that If he was found not guilty, then he would sue the girls, their parents, and the “ 
       Sun 
       ” newspaper. We see no reason to disbelieve her evidence to the effect that Victims’ Compensation was discussed with him, particularly as it was recorded in her instructions.  
        
        
       (w) The instructions embodied in Exhibit 3 do note that the appellant was aware that should he “ 
       indicate a plea of guilty and then wish to vary it, then his present legal advisers would have to withdraw it 
       ”. The Legal Aid solicitor indicated that this was a standard form, and that the word ‘it’, being the final word in the relevant sentence, may well have been a typographical error. However, she recalled that advice was given to the appellant after he had given his instructions to plead guilty, that if he thereafter decided to change his plea the legal advisers would have to withdraw from the case. Clearly, that reflected their ethical obligation, and it explains the recollection that the appellant and the other witness had as to the question of the legal advisers withdrawing having been discussed. It is, of course, quite contrary to their account of what was said. Again, we have no reason to disbelieve the Legal Aid solicitor or counsel on this aspect of the case.  
        
        
       (x) It also emerged, in the course of cross-examination of the Legal Aid solicitor, that the appellant asserted that the written instructions which bear on their face, his signature, were forgeries, so far as his signature is concerned. It was his suggestion that she had information available or material which he had signed in her brief, from which she was able to copy and forge his signature. She unequivocally denied any such suggestion, and again we have no reason to disbelieve what she said in this regard. 
        
       
     3 The appellant, who appeared in person to argue the application, contends that the conviction and sentence should be set aside for a number of reasons which, relevantly, involve submissions that: 
      
       
        
       (a) the sentencing indication hearing was improperly sought unilaterally by the Crown; 
        
        
       (b) he was given corrupt legal advice, and improperly pressured into pleading guilty; 
        
        
       (c) the evidence placed before the Court for the sentence indication was inadmissible; 
        
        
       (d) what occurred that day amounted to a criminal conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and to obtain (on the part of MK) a financial benefit by deception; 
        
        
       (e) he has been intimidated out of pursuing his case until now;  
        
        
       (f) the plea was unlawfully obtained by fraud and duress. 
        
       
     4 In amplification of these submissions he suggested, at various times during the hearing, that there had been a conspiracy to suppress the evidence of the complainants and to avoid having their evidence tested in court; that it was never shown that the complainants were existing persons; that his legal representatives had deliberately misled Judge Maguire; that his signature to the instructions had been forged by one or other of his legal advisers and that the sentence indication was a “ruse by people in authority to get a matter resolved expeditiously”.  
      
       
     5 Critical for this application is the fact that a period of seven and a half years elapsed between the date of conviction and the filing of the appeal, and that during this period an application for leave to appeal against sentence was summarily dismissed for want of prosecution. Additionally there is the circumstance that the sentence has been entirely served. 
      
       
     6 In Regina v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J observed at p 148: - 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         On many occasions it has been observed by Courts of Criminal Appeal, that intending appellants should not assume that delays in filing notices of appeal or applications for leave to appeal, and especially considerable delays, will automatically be excused. See for example R v Sunderland, R v Tyrell, and R v Waterhouse. This Court takes the opportunity to emphasise again that it should not be assumed that a failure to give notice to appeal, or notice of intention to appeal, or to furnish proper grounds of appeal within time will be excused. Certainly, where any considerable delay has occurred, exceptional circumstances will be required before the appeal is permitted to proceed. This was the view expressed by Street CJ in R v Sunderland, and we think it is a proper view.”  
         (References ommitted). 
         
        
       
     7 As Greg James J observed in Regina v Brehoi [1999] NSWCCA 113 the burden which rests upon an applicant in relation to an application of this kind, will be “harder to discharge the longer any suggested matter impugning the integrity of the plea and known to the applicant is allowed to lie.”. 
      
       
     8 It is true that s 10(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act confers an unfettered discretion on the Court to extend the time where it is just, under the circumstances, that such an order be made. Inevitably that requires that attention be given to whether or not there is, in the circumstances of the particular case, room for concern that there may have been a miscarriage of justice: see R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 per Smart AJ (with whom Studdert and Dunford JJ agreed) at paras 35 to 37 and 48; also see R v O’Donahue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397. This is because the existence of a reasonable misgiving as to whether an appellant received a fair trial according to law, will very often constitute the exceptional circumstance which would overcome the fact of lengthy delay.  
      
       
     9 Also to be taken into account is the well accepted principle of finality, noted in decisions such as Regina v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 and KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 at para 31. Additionally, it is appropriate to have regard to the difficulties which are likely to be occasioned to the Crown and to victims, if a retrial is sought very many years after proceedings were understood to have been brought to a finality, and the appellant has sat by, as he has here, without seeking to enforce rights which he must have known he had.  
      
       
     10 In relation to the principle concerning the regularity of a plea and the duty that rests upon legal practitioners when giving advice to an accused person concerning the offer of a plea of guilty, we can do no better than to adopt the observations of Ipp AJA, with whom Sperling J agreed, in KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 at paras 33 and 100-101: - 
      
       
        
         
         “The law regards the need for a plea of guilty to be freely and voluntarily made as a fundamental element of the administration of justice. Thus, as Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ said in  
         Meissner v The Queen 
          (at 142): 
          
          
           
           "" 
           If conduct has the tendency to induce a person to plead guilty when that person would have pleaded not guilty had he or she exercised a free choice in his or her own interests, the actus reus of an attempt to pervert the course of justice is established 
           "". 
            
           
          
         It follows that legal practitioners who represent accused persons owe a duty to the court not to bring improper pressure to bear on their clients to plead guilty. In particular, that duty would be breached by a practitioner deliberately or negligently giving the client false information that the trial judge had expressed a particular opinion as to the prospects of the client being found guilty. Such a duty is part of the general duty not to corrupt the administration of justice which in turn is derived from the public interest in ensuring that the administration of justice is not subverted or distorted by dishonest or negligent practices.” 
          
         
        
       
     11 As was additionally said by Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 143: - 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Argument or advice that merely seeks to persuade the accused to plead guilty is not improper conduct for this purpose, no matter how strongly the argument or advice is put. Reasoned argument or advice does not involve the use of improper means and does not have the tendency to prevent the accused from making a free and voluntary choice concerning his or her plea to the charge. As long as the argument or advice does not constitute harassment or other improper pressure and leaves the accused free to make the choice, no interference with the administration of justice occurs. 
         
        
        
         
         Conduct is likely to have the tendency to interfere with a person’s free choice to plead not guilty, however, when the conduct consists of a promise or benefit that is offered in consideration of the accused pleading guilty. The difficulty in such cases is to draw the line between offers of assistance that improperly impact on the accused’s freedom of choice and offers of assistance that are legitimate inducements. In most cases, that difficulty can be resolved by determining whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the offer could reasonably be regarded as intended to protect or advance the legitimate interests of the accused having regard to the threat to those interests that arises from the institution of the criminal proceedings. 
         ” 
         
        
       
     12 Finally, as a matter of clear legal principle, we observe that since it is the appellant who contends that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he bears the onus of demonstrating that fact: Regina v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 37. To the extent to which this depends upon a resolution of matters of fact, he bears the onus of establishing the necessary facts: Regina v Ross (NSWCCA 20 April 1994). 
      
       
     13 When invited to provide an explanation for the lengthy delay between the date of conviction and the filing of the notice of appeal, the appellant offered several reasons, all of which, in our assessment, were totally unconvincing. None provides any cogent explanation for his delay. First he said that it was due to the fact that he was “a pacifist”, and it would have meant giving evidence against other people. Next, he suggested that it may have had something to do with the accumulated effect of three sets of subsequent proceedings brought in the Local Court and by way of appeal in the District Court, in which he had been involved, two of which related to charges involving alleged breaches, on his part, of an Apprehended Violence Order, obtained by a neighbour in late 1996. The bringing of these proceedings in the Local Court he asserted amounted to “consistent harassment” of him.  
      
       
     14 In this respect, the first conviction was recorded on 17 June 1997, and confirmed on appeal on 19 November 1998. The second conviction was recorded on 24 September 1998 and confirmed on appeal on 31 August 1999. On this occasion there was also a conviction for an offence of common assault. This eventually led to sentences of imprisonment of 6 months and 3 months being imposed, following the refusal of the appellant to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years.  
      
       
     15 The third set of proceedings involved a charge of assault of a Crown Prosecutor, for which a conviction was recorded on 3 May 2001 and again, confirmed on appeal, on 10 August 2001. That Crown Prosecutor had appeared in the District Court proceedings of 31 August 1999.16 These various convictions, the appellant contended, had all been improperly obtained. Although he had wanted to clear his name, he had not done so because the Crown, he said, kept wrongly taking him back to court. In this regard it appears that he, in some way, relates these proceedings to the original proceedings in respect of which he believes that a conspiracy existed. That conspiracy he claims has been maintained, and is one to which the Crown is a party. As a result, he suggested, he had suffered psychological harm and he had been unable to prosecute the appeal. Thirdly, he said, although he felt strongly about what happened in 1994, he had been a “slow considerer”, who did not have an understanding of the law.  
      
       
     17 None of these reasons offered has any cogency. The case is one where no new or fresh evidence has come to light, or where any genuine reason for delay has been identified. The appellant on his account was frustrated and dissatisfied from the time of conviction, yet he did nothing about it, even though all the relevant facts were within his possession. He initially lodged an appeal against sentence only, and it was dismissed because he failed to prosecute it. The case is one where, for no good reason, he has simply failed to pursue the rights which he had to appeal against conviction, and to seek to have the plea withdrawn. 
      
       
     18 That is not necessarily the end of the matter, because the Court can still intervene if it is of the view that there was a tangible risk of a miscarriage of justice having occurred. 
      
       
     19 The appellant has not submitted any credible evidence in support of his submission that there was a criminal conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and/or to obtain a financial benefit by deception. There is no rational basis, on the material before us, to suspect that there ever was any such conspiracy in existence. So far as this rests upon some inference that there was a plan to secure Victims’ Compensation, and that the girls’ entitlement in that regard was wrongly withheld from him, that is entirely refuted by the evidence of the Legal Aid solicitor, to the effect that this matter was specifically brought to his attention during the initial instructions. 
      
       
     20 By reason of the written instructions, and the clear and cogent evidence of trial counsel and solicitor, which we prefer to that of the appellant and his parents, none of whom made a favourable impression on us, we do not believe that there is any factual basis for the various assertions made to the effect that the appellant’s plea was entered as a result of fraud or duress or improper pressure from his legal advisers. Nor is there any credible basis to assume or to find that he was given corrupt or inappropriate legal advice, or that he has been in any way intimidated from pursuing his rights since the time of the conviction. In fact, his unsupported allegations of conduct which would amount to serious criminality on the part of others, including an assertion that his legal advisers were working hand in hand with the Crown to make sure that a conviction was obtained, do him no credit whatsoever.  
      
       
     21 To the contrary of his unfounded claims, we are of the view that he received careful and competent advice from his legal advisers, who acted prudently, at every step, in obtaining his written and signed instructions. The evidence before us supports the proposition, and no other proposition, that the plea was one which he entered, in the exercise of free choice, after having been properly advised as to his rights.  
      
       
     22 The record also does not bear out any of the various other matters which the appellant seeks to raise as irregularities or procedural deficiencies. It is convenient to note them briefly: 
      
       
       
       (a) The evidence placed before his Honour Judge Patten at the time of the sentence indication hearing, and subsequently during the sentencing proceedings, contrary to the position contended for by the appellant, was admissible and followed the usual practice for such proceedings.  
        
        
       (b) The holding of a sentence indication hearing clearly was sought by both parties, and it was not an event which was adverse to the interests of the appellant, as his submissions appear to have assumed. Rather, it was a proceeding of potential assistance to him, particularly having regard to the benefit which attached to the utilitarian value of the plea, which he later offered.  
        
        
       (c) Although notice was not given in advance of the sentence indication hearing, as provided for in Practice Note 31, this was a procedural requirement, potentially in the way of the applicant, and favourably for him, it was waived.  
        
        
       (d) In the circumstances in which the sentence indication hearing was conducted, there was no necessity for the complainants to have been called as witnesses, nor was there any necessity for them to be called as witnesses during the sentencing proceedings, since he was taken, by his plea, to admit the allegations which they made. His contention that there was a conspiracy of silence to keep them out of the witness box has absolutely no substance, as is the case with the additional assertion that such complainants might not even have existed. In this regard, he made a quite spurious allegation that the statements were not properly authenticated, since they did not bear the signatures of the DOCS officers who were present during the interviews. The statements were signed by each of the complainants, and they were witnessed by a Police Officer. There is absolutely no basis for the appellant’s querying of the existence of the complainants, or of the genuineness of their statements, or indeed of the genuineness of the prosecution.  
        
        
       (e) The effect of the order made by his Honour Judge Urquhart on 9 August 1993 was not, as the appellant contends, such that the Crown was required to present him for trial on a not guilty basis. It was at all times his option, which he exercised, to plead guilty when he was called on for trial. 
        
        
       (f) Although the letter from the mother of MK may not properly have amounted to a Victim Impact Statement in accordance with the law in force at the time, that was not a matter which disadvantaged the appellant, since in accordance with authority it could not have been taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. Nor was any logical basis demonstrated for the contention presented by the appellant, that its preparation revealed prior “exact knowledge” on the part of the Crown and of MK’s mother, that the appellant would be pressured into pleading guilty to a count on an indictment charging him with the indecent assault of MK. It is a regular practice for such documents to be prepared in advance of the hearing, in case the matter results in a plea or a conviction. 
        
        
       (g) Again contrary to the assumption of the appellant, it was not necessary for his Honour Judge Maguire to have empanelled a jury when the matter was called on before him. In fact it would have been an error of law to have done so once the appellant entered a plea of guilty. In addition there was no basis whatsoever for the appellant’s assertion that his counsel concealed from his Honour that there was to be a trial. It remained at all times the right of the appellant to plead guilty or not guilty and thereby to determine whether there should be a trial or not.  
        
        
       (h) Again, there is no basis in the submission that his legal representatives were incompetent in relation to the alibi. They acknowledged that, at an early stage, the appellant had indicated that from time to time he was absent from his home, visiting relatives either in Sydney or Newcastle. Put in such broad terms, it would not have been possible to serve a proper alibi notice. It was not until the Crown narrowed the date to a particular day that this became a relevant consideration sufficient to found an alibi notice. It was only on 28 February that the appellant specifically nominated that he had been in Newcastle on 7 October. Before then, his solicitors and counsel had acted entirely correctly in subpoenaing the records from the various nursing homes so as to investigate dates on which the appellant could be shown to have been out of the relevant area. Again, their advice to him as to the possible adverse consequences of a false or late alibi was entirely appropriate and correct. There is nothing in the submission that this involved incompetence on their part, or was indicative of their being party to a conspiracy. 
        
       
     23 In all of these circumstances we are unpersuaded that any tangible risk of a miscarriage of justice has been shown. In the absence of any acceptable explanation of the lengthy delay in the filing of the notice of appeal, we order that the application to extend the time for the filing of the notice of the appeal be refused, and that the appeal be dismissed.

     EMMANUEL HRISS v NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION 
     
     
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By Notice of Motion dated 23 August 1993, filed the next day, Mr Emmanuel Hriss sought certain orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. That motion is still pending and the New South Wales Crime Commission, by Amended Notice of Motion filed in Court today, seeks an order under Pt 13 r 5 dismissing Mr Hriss’ motion. It is not in dispute that in order to succeed on this motion the Commission needs to establish its case to the standard discussed in such cases as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways, New South Wales (1964) 112 CLR 125. 
     
      
    2 There are two separate transactions involved, which raise distinct questions. One transaction concerns some land at Fine Flower near Grafton. This was a rural property apparently owned by a company called Texas Stud Pty Limited. 
     
      
    3 The Commission brought the present proceedings against Mr Hriss’ son Michael Goldstein and the latter’s wife. On 25 February 1993 orders were made, by consent, for the forfeiture of various items of property. Of immediate relevance, an order was made by consent as between the Commission and Mr and Mrs Goldstein, and with the concurrence of Texas Stud Pty Limited, for the forfeiture of the interest of Texas Stud Pty Limited in the property in question. 
     
      
    4 Mr Hriss now seeks the making of an exclusion order within the meaning of s25 of the Act. The Commission contends, firstly, that Mr Hriss has not shown that he has any interest in the property and, secondly, that even if he did have an interest in the property, he has no standing to make the application he has made, because the forfeiture order was not an order for the forfeiture of his interest, as distinct from an order for the forfeiture of the interest of Texas Stud Pty Limited.  
     
      
    5 Mr Hriss contends that, at least arguably, for the purposes of the Commission’s present motion, he had an equitable interest in the land. What evidence there is on this question comes from para 5 of the affidavit of Mr Hriss of 19 August 1993.  
     
      
    6 Mr Hriss says that his son told him of the son’s plans to purchase a farm to grow olive trees. Mr Hriss went to Greece and there spoke to a nephew, Mr Konstantoudakis, who offered to assist “you” (Mr Hriss) with a loan. Later on Mr Goldstein located the property in question and told Mr Hriss that he wanted to go ahead and buy it. Mr Hriss went back to Greece again and spoke to Mr Konstantoudakis again. The latter then agreed to lend Mr Hriss $210,000. 
     
      
    7 Next, Mr Hriss entered into a further loan agreement with his son, the son acting by an attorney in Greece. This latter loan agreement was reduced to writing. It is in the Greek language but a translation is in evidence as exhibit 1. It is a simple loan agreement providing for the loan of $210,000 and some odd cents, the loan to be repaid in a year’s time. It does not mention the property in question at all. 
     
      
    8 Mr Hriss said that Mr Konstantoudakis gave him (Mr Hriss) three cheques totalling $210,000. Mr Hriss brought those cheques back to Australia and gave them to his son. He says that he believes that his son deposited the cheques into the son’s bank account and that the son used the proceeds to complete the purchase of the land in question. Then Mr Hriss says:- 
     
      
       
        
        “After completion, I instructed my solicitor to lodge a caveat on the title in order to protect my interest and my obligations to my nephew.” 
        
       
      
    9 The hearing proceeded on the convention that a caveat was lodged but later withdrawn.  
     
      
    10 Mr Hriss also said that his son told him that he would be able to plant 20,000 to 30,000 olive trees on the property and that he (Mr Hriss) visited the property on two occasions, once before and once after the purchase. 
     
      
    11 On this evidence the Commission contends that there is no evidence that Mr Hriss had any interest in the property. Section 7 of the Act defines the expression “interest in property”. Perhaps the most significant part of that definition for present purposes is that set out in sub-s (4). That sub-section reads:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) In this section: 
         
        interest 
        , in relation to property, means: 
         
          
          (a) a legal or equitable estate or interest in the property, or 
           
          (b) a right, power or privilege in connection with the property, 
          
         
        whether present or future and whether vested or contingent.” 
        
       
      
    12 It seems to me that there is no evidence in the material now before me that Mr Hriss had any interest in the property as defined in s 7. Assuming that he lodged a caveat claiming some interest, and assuming that he thought he had some interest, the evidence does not establish that he did have such an interest. At best from his perspective, he borrowed money from his nephew and then lent the same amount of money to his son and his son used the money to buy the land, but that does not mean that Mr Hriss had an interest in the land. It would, of course, have been quite different if the evidence disclosed that the son gave, or agreed to give a mortgage or some other form of security for the land but there is just no evidence of that. 
     
      
    13 The Commission takes a second point. It says that Mr Hriss has no standing to make the application under s 25, because the order made for the forfeiture of the interest was an order for the forfeiture of the interest held by Texas Stud Pty Limited and not the interest of Mr Hriss. Decisions such as New South Wales Crime Commission v Young (10 August 1992 Badgery-Parker J, unreported) and Black Yhlans Inc v State of New South Wales (5 December 1996 McInerney J, unreported) seem to me to support that proposition. 
     
      
    14 That is both grounds of attack made by the Commission upon Mr Hriss’ application in relation to the property at Fine Flower succeed. 
     
      
    15 Mr Hriss moves separately for an order setting aside two orders made in proceedings No 70562/90. This is procedurally irregular but no point was taken about this and I proceed on the basis that s 81 of the Supreme Court Act covers the situation. 
     
      
    16 Mr Goldstein was apparently arrested but an order was made for his release on bail on terms that a surety pay $200,000 into court. Mr Hriss contacted Mr Konstantoudakis again and Mr Konstantoudakis offered to assist. In the meantime, it seems that a Mr Thomakakis agreed to act as surety.  
     
      
    17 It was then arranged between Mr Hriss and Mr Thomakakis that if Mr Thomakakis paid the $200,000 in question into court, Mr Hriss would pay the same amount of money into Mr Thomakakis’ bank account. Mr Hriss said that he told Mr Thomakakis that he would do this “so that you can draw on same to live off until the bail is refunded.” The grammar used was imperfect but the meaning is plain.  
     
      
    18 After that, Mr Hriss arranged for Mr Konstantoudakis to pay $200,000 direct into the bank account of Mr Thomakakis and his wife. I was told, without objection, that Mr Goldstein absconded and the money paid by Mr Thomakakis by way of security was forfeited. The position now appears to be that Mr Konstantoudakis, at the request of Mr Hriss, lent $200,000 to Mr Thomakakis.  
     
      
    19 In his affidavit Mr Hriss says: “I say that this sum of $200,000 is owed by me to my nephew Michael Goldstein.” That was not objected to, except that the Commission said that the whole affidavit was irrelevant, and Mr Hriss now relies on the statement being evidence. In truth, it seems to me it is no more than an assertion, i.e. an assertion of a conclusion of law, or mixed fact and law that can rise no higher than the supporting evidence. 
     
      
    20 Mr Hriss may well owe Mr Konstantoudakis the money at law or in honour, but the critical question is whether Mr Hriss had an interest in the money forfeited, and the precise order made was that:-  
     
      
       
        
        “The interest in property (within the meaning of ‘interest in property’ defined in s 7 of the Act) of Mario Thomakakis in the property described in [a particular schedule] be forfeited to and vest in the Crown.”  
        
       
      
    21 That schedule referred to said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “$200,000 which was deposited into a term deposit account in the St George Building Society Limited in the names of M and T Thomakakis on 13 February 1992 by way of a bank cheque No 116610 drawn on 6 February 1992 on the Drapetsona Branch No 651 of the National Bank of Greece in favour of Mario Thomakakis.” 
        
       
      
    22 If one analyses the transaction, Mr Hriss requested Mr Konstantoudakis to pay the money into the bank account of Mr Thomakakis in circumstances where Mr Thomakakis had already paid the same amount of money into court. Mr Hriss and Mr Konstantoudakis acted as they did in order that Mr Thomakakis might have funds to live on, replacing the funds that he had used to enable Mr Goldstein to be released on bail. It was apparently regarded by all concerned as a loan to Mr Thomakakis, the expectation of all concerned being that Mr Goldstein would answer his bail, the money paid by way of security would be repaid to Mr Thomakakis and Mr Thomakakis would then repay Mr Konstantoudakis either directly or indirectly through Mr Hriss; but, in the meantime, it seems quite clear the money in the bank account of Mr and Mrs Thomakakis was their money – they and only they had an interest in the money.  
     
      
    23 I consider that the Commission succeeds on this basis in respect of this money. Equally, for the reasons given in relation to the Fine Flower property, the Commission succeeds in relation to the money in the bank account on the question of standing, i.e. Mr Hriss lacks the necessary standing to make an application under s 25. The forfeiture order in question related to the forfeiture of an interest other than the interest of Mr Hriss.  
     
      
    24 Also, in relation to the question of the money, the Commission takes a third point. It says that Mr Hriss was a stranger to the proceedings where the order was made and that he has not demonstrated any basis upon which he, a stranger to that litigation, is entitled to have an order of the Court duly and formally entered set aside. In the circumstances, I need not consider this contention. 
     
      
    25 I make orders in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the amended notice of motion filed today.

      REGINA v Brian Edward GAY  
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 MASON P: The applicant, Brian Edward Gay, was dealt with in the District Court for ten charges of defrauding the Commonwealth, pursuant to s 29D of the Crimes Act, 1914 (Cth). Five charges related to his failure to declare part of his income in his personal income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 1989 to 1993. The other five charges related to his being knowingly concerned in the failure by a company known as Roktat Pty Limited to declare part of its income in its income tax returns for the same financial years. On 26 April 2001 Shillington DCJ sentenced him on each charge to concurrent terms of imprisonment for three years, to date from the date on which sentence was passed, and directed his release on recognizance upon certain conditions after twelve months.  
      
       
     2 The applicant sought leave to appeal against those sentences. The application was heard on 8 November 2001 and the Court determined that the appeal should be allowed and the appellant resentenced, undertaking to give its reasons later. Effectively, the three year sentence was affirmed but the recognizance release order was varied so as to enable the applicant’s release that same day, 8 November. These are my reasons for that decision. 
      
       
     3 The applicant and his wife were the directors of Roktat Pty Limited. However, the applicant’s wife had no active role in the company’s affairs and it was effectively controlled by the applicant himself. The company carried out electrical installation work in coalmines in the Hunter Valley. During the relevant financial years the applicant prepared invoices in the name of Trademax Products, a registered business name in which he and his wife had an interest, which falsely claimed payment for products said to have been supplied to Roktat. Roktat’s cashbook reflected payments for those falsely invoiced goods. The money was then drawn from Roktat’s funds and used for the applicant’s personal requirements. 
      
       
     4 In the years 1991 to 1993 smaller amounts were withdrawn from Roktat’s funds and shown in the cashbook as payments to various building suppliers for Roktat’s purposes. In fact, the money was paid for building requisites for a family home which was under construction. 
      
       
     5 As a result, in Roktat’s tax returns for the five year period false deductions were claimed totalling $378,173.20, resulting in the avoidance of tax in an amount of $145,703.99. The applicant’s use of these funds for his own purposes led to his income being understated in his personal tax returns for the same period. The total income undeclared was $198,751, the tax avoided being $96,386. 
      
       
     6 Rightly, the learned sentencing judge viewed the offences seriously. In his remarks his Honour observed: 
      
       
        
         
         The nation’s well-being depends on the orderly and fair provision of funds from citizens and corporate entities. The fraudulent activity here involved large amounts, continued over a lengthy period, was not readily detected and was deliberately designed to avoid detection. 
         
        
        
       
     7 On the other hand, his Honour took into account a number of matters favourable to the applicant. He is fifty one years old, the father of three daughters. He had no previous convictions. There was an impressive body of character evidence, including evidence of his involvement in community affairs. He had been committed to the District Court for sentence, having pleaded guilty in the Local Court. Over the years between the detection of his offences and his standing for sentence his health had deteriorated. 
      
       
     8 His Honour also referred to the delay in the institution of the prosecution, and to the fact that amended tax assessments had been issued which imposed substantial penalties. Both these matters call for closer examination. 
      
       
     9 An audit by the Australian Taxation Office took place between September 1993 and March 1995. During the early stages the applicant proffered a number of the falsified Trademax invoices in an endeavour to escape detection. He also wrote a letter dated 15 April 1994, described as a “Statement of Disclosure”, which (to say the least) fell far short of what it professed. Indeed, it falsely represented that the payments to the applicant were a loan. This led to the extension of the audit to cover the years ending June 1989 to 1993 inclusive. Amended assessments issued in March 1995. The applicant was not interviewed by police until November 1996 and it was not until almost three years later, in October 1999, that the summonses instituting the present proceedings were issued notwithstanding that the prosecution is based upon admissions made in the police interview which addressed matters already brought to light in the audit. There appears to have been no undue delay thereafter, but there is no explanation for the passage of some four and a half years between the completion of the audit and the commencement of the prosecution. 
      
       
     10 In the meantime, as I have said, the amended assessments were issued. The company and the applicant were assessed as liable to pay substantial amounts of primary and “penalty” tax on the additional income discovered in the audit. 
      
       
     11 If one is confined to those portions of the assessments which relate to the fraudulently suppressed income of Roktat Pty Ltd and the applicant, the figures, according to a schedule prepared for this Court, are:

     12 The applicant objected to those assessments but the objections were disallowed in February 1996. Borrowing money on the security of the family home, the applicant paid the amount due from him personally (as well as meeting his wife’s amended assessment). Following demands for payment by Roktat’s liquidator, the applicant went bankrupt on his own petition in February 2000. At the end of that year a scheme of arrangement was entered into whereby upon annulment of the bankruptcy, $250,000 was to be paid by the applicant in full satisfaction of the company’s tax liability. $100,000 was paid at that time and the balance is to be paid over the next four years. 
      
       
     13 Despite a request from the Court, the respondent has not provided a reference to the sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act pursuant to which the various items of additional tax penalty were imposed. Since however the rate of penalty appears to be at least 60% of the primary tax it may be inferred that the penalty was struck on the basis of false and misleading statements in returns, subject to limited remission (see 1991 Australian Master Tax Guide chapter 24). Ultimately the detail does not matter: it is sufficient to note that there was a significant punitive element in the amended assessments issued in March 1995. As indicated, the applicant met all of the tax imposed in respect of his own income and a substantial portion of the tax imposed in respect of Roktat’s income. 
      
       
     14 Were it not for the combined effect of the tax penalties and the delay I would have left the sentence undisturbed. These were serious offences involving studied dishonesty and careful contrivance over a period of years. The sums involved were substantial. Tax evasion is difficult to detect and apparently widespread. See generally R v Stitt (1998) 102 ACrimR 428; R v Hamman (CCA, 1 December 1998, unreported); R v Kelvin [2000] NSWCCA 190; R v Cappadona (2001) 47 ATR 317. 
      
       
     15 It is however well established that fairness may require a court to reduce what might otherwise be an appropriate sentence. In Blanco (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 Wood CJ at CL, who gave the judgment for the Court, referred to R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 and Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64-66 and continued (at 306): 
      
       
        
         
         The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach. 
         
        
        
       
     16 In R v Schwabegger [1998] 4 VR 649 the Victorian Court of Appeal applied these principles in a case which involved lengthy and substantially unexplained delay between detection and prosecution coupled with the payment by the offender of all tax owing plus substantial penalties. Vincent AJA said (at 659): 
      
       
        
         
         … Delay which is not attributable to the offender, of course, constitutes “a powerful mitigatory factor.”:  
         R v Liang and Li 
          (1995) 124 FLR 350 at 356; 82 A Crim R 39 at 45. It can have relevance at a number of levels. In  
         Duncan v R 
          (1983) 47 ALR 746; 9 A Crim R 354 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia stated at ALR 749, A Crim R 356-7: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … where, prior to sentence, there has been a lengthy process of rehabilitation and the evidence does not indicate a need to protect society from the applicant, the punitive and deterrent aspects of the sentencing process should not be allowed to prevail so as to possibly destroy the results of that rehabilitation. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … The very fact of the long delay in bringing the matter to court which led the applicant to have this matter hanging over his head for nearly four years is rightly prayed in aid on his behalf. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Further, there is, in my opinion, a serious incongruity between the assertion that an offence is serious and that the courts must, through the sentences they impose, endeavour to limit its incidence, on the one hand, and such a leisurely progression of the criminal justice proceedings which follow its commission that literally years pass before the matter comes before the court, on the other. For a number of reasons, the investigation and prosecution of criminal conduct should be conducted as quickly as is reasonably practicable if the objectives of the system are to be attained. Additionally, a legitimate sense of unfairness can develop when the criminal justice process proceeds in what can be perceived as too leisurely a fashion. 
         
        
        
       
     17 I respectfully agree. 
      
       
     18 One hopes that the present circumstances are fairly unique. If they are not, then the practice of the Australian Taxation Office and/or the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions must change. It is bordering on the unconscionable for three years to elapse between a police interview which results in full admissions and the laying of ensuing charges. The fact that administrative penalties are imposed (prior to the police interview) and substantially met with all of their attendant burdens upon the defaulting taxpayer and his family makes it even more imperative that a sentencing court take the delay into account. The public interest as well as the legitimate private interests of the offender require a matter such as this to be brought to justice quickly. A failure by the authorities to do so will mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence. 
      
       
     19 In my view a custodial sentence remained appropriate, but the combined effect of the matters to which I have adverted called for separate treatment in the manner I have suggested. Because it seemed to me that in all of the circumstances it was appropriate to halve an otherwise proper non-parole period I joined in the order made on 8 November 2001. 
      
       
     20 HULME J: I agree with the reasons of Mason P. 
      
       
     21 However I would add this. Although it would seem that the principle of autrefois convict does not operate to prevent the bringing of criminal charges in respect of conduct which has been previously punished by the administrative imposition of penalties – a matter which was not argued - justice requires that that earlier punishment be taken into account when a court comes to sentence an offender in respect of the charges. Authorities that it should be include R v Morris (1993) VR 192, Whitnall (1993) 68 A Crim R 119, and DPP v Hamman (unreported, CCA, 1 December 1998) 
      
       
     22 However, in DPP v Hamman (unreported, CCA, 1 December 1998) Sheller JA, with the concurrence of Levine J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “While undoubtedly it is a matter to be taken into account, it is, in my opinion, of small account, that when caught out the offender pays the tax due and additional tax by way of penalty for which the offender is liable to a greater or lesser extent, according to the Commissioner’s discretion, whatever the reason for non-disclosure.” 
         
        
       
     23 So far as these remarks relate to payment of the tax due, I agree. An offender can claim small credit for performing his legal obligations in common with most of the community. The same may be said of so much of the additional tax as represents interest on tax not paid, certainly if this interest is at more or less a commercial rather than a punitive rate. However, I am unable to agree that payment of additional tax is necessarily to be regarded as of small account. If, of course, the amount of additional tax is small, or perhaps even if large, is of little consequence to a particular offender, this may be an appropriate view but otherwise it seems to me that the significance of the payment of additional tax should be assessed on its merits. If it amounts to a significant punishment in its own right, then it may well be that it should significantly mitigate the punishment which would otherwise be imposed.  
      
       
     24 Sheller JA gave no authority or reasoning for his view. In Whitnall (at 125) Higgins J, with whom Drummond J agreed, said that the degree of hardship imposed by a pecuniary penalty imposed administratively was relevant. Drummond J went on to say that if a heavy penalty has been imposed by administrative action, there is an element of oppression involved in asking a court to then deal severely with the offender. It may be that that is not necessarily so in every case but it clearly is a distinct possibility. The preferable approach is to consider every case on its own merits recognising that, even though Parliament may have provided for 2 punishments, it has nowhere said that the quantum of the first should not be fairly taken into account in any determination of the second.  
      
       
     25 Furthermore, it must also be relevant to consider all of the consequences to an offender of his criminality. In consequence of his wrong-doing and the administrative penalties imposed, possibly contributed to by the delay in the bringing of proceedings, the Appellant lost his home and his health. It would seem that he also lost a successful and profitable business albeit he seems to have, at least partially, replaced this with another. 
      
       
     26 Although his Honour recognised that the delay had had a serious effect of the Appellant’s health and a sentence of imprisonment was likely to “significantly impact on the viability of” the Appellant’s business, such reference as was made to the consequences the Appellant had suffered as a result of his offending was very brief and I confess that my firm impression is that his Honour did not give to these matters the weight they deserved. 
      
       
     27 HIDDEN J: I agree with Mason P.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge Coorey in the District Court at Sydney on 3 August 2001. 
      
       
     2 The respondent had pleaded guilty to the relevant charges in the Local Court on 21 March 2001 and had been committed for sentence. By reason of a defect in the committal document, the matter proceeded before his Honour on an indictment, pleas being entered on 18 July 2001, and sentences thereafter imposed, in relation to each of four counts as follows: 
      
       
        
       Count 1: Supply a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine (500.9 grams) contrary to s 25(2) of the  
       Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        1985 (hereafter referred to as  
       The Drug Act 
       ), - sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four years, each to date from 9 January 2001, being the date of arrest. 
        
        
         
        
       Count 2: Supply the prohibited drug 3:4 methylenedioxymethyl-amphetamine (hereafter referred to as MDMA or Ecstasy) (120.9 grams), contrary to s 25(1) of  
       The Drug Act 
       , - sentenced to a fixed term of three years, also to date from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2004. 
        
        
       Count 3: Supply the prohibited drug MDMA (14.2 grams) contrary to s 25(1) of  
       The Drug Act 
        - sentenced to a fixed term of three years to date from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2004. 
        
        
       Count 4: Deemed supply of a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug MDMA (149.2 grams) contrary to s 25(2) of  
       The Drug Act 
        - sentenced to a fixed term of four years, to date from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2005. 
        
       
     3 A further charge of possession of 27.7 grams of cannabis leaf contrary to s 10(1) of The Drug Act, was taken into account on a schedule in relation to count 1. 
      
       
     4 At the time of the offence and sentences, the respondent was on parole for the Federal offences of knowingly being concerned in the importation of cocaine and of possession of that prohibited import. For these matters he had been sentenced, on 30 March 1992, to concurrent terms of imprisonment for twelve years, with a non-parole period of seven years, each to date from 9 September 1990. He had been released to parole upon the expiry of the non-parole period and, accordingly, was subject to supervision and to the possibility of revocation of his parole until it expired on 9 September 2002. 
      
       
     5 By reason of the operation of s 19AQ of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) the passing of the sentences for the State offences, in respect of which he appeared before his Honour Judge Coorey, automatically meant that his parole was revoked from 3 August 2001, that being the date on which sentence was passed. 
      
       
     6 A warrant was issued by his Honour, purportedly under s 19AS of the Crimes Act, although it was not in the precise terms of the section, which stipulates that a court imposing a new sentence must issue a warrant authorising the person to be detained in prison, and to undergo imprisonment for the unserved part of the outstanding sentence. 
      
       
     7 The error which his Honour made in expressing the terms of that warrant was no doubt corrected when the warrant itself was drawn up, since it involved no more than a slip of the tongue in the manner in which the order was expressed. 
      
       
     8 It was the case that during his release on parole the respondent had also been convicted and fined in the Local Court, on 11 August 2000, for an offence of the supply of .5 of a gram of Ecstasy. The Attorney General’s Department (Commonwealth) formally cautioned the respondent by letter dated 24 August 2000, after this conviction, that committing offences, particularly drug offences, constituted a breach of parole and may lead to its revocation. 
      
       
     9 The practical consequence for the respondent, arising out of the backdating of the new sentences to the date of arrest, was that: 
      
       
        
       (a) Between 9 January 2001 and 3 August 2001, that is a period of six months, three weeks and four days, he is to be taken as having been held in custody solely in relation to the new offences. 
        
        
       (b) Between 3 August 2001 and 9 September 2002, that is one year, five weeks and two days, he will be serving the balance of parole for the Federal offences concurrently with the sentences for the new offences, and 
        
        
       (c) Between 9 September 2002 and 8 January 2007, although subject to earlier release on parole, for which he is eligible from 9 January 2005, he will again be held in custody solely by reference to the new offences. 
        
        
        
       THE FACTS 
       
     10 The respondent was arrested in the course of a police operation which had him under surveillance on 9 January 2001. At around 8 o’clock on that morning he was seen to hand from his motor vehicle a package to another man, referred to as Mr W, who approached him on a bicycle. When that person was arrested he was found to be in possession of 500 tablets of MDMA or Ecstasy. This became the subject of count 2. 
      
       
     11 At around 11.45 am the respondent was seen to enter a flat at Randwick, from which he emerged a short time later carrying a white shopping bag. At about 3.45 pm he was observed driving into a car park at Leichhardt. He left his vehicle and met a Mr Nicodin, who accompanied him back to his car. 
      
       
     12 Mr Nicodin was then seen to leave that vehicle carrying a white envelope. He was stopped by police. The envelope was searched and found to contain the methylamphetamine, the subject of count 1. 
      
       
     13 The respondent was also stopped and searched as he was driving towards the car park exit. The white shopping bag was found to contain $90,100 in cash. A further $3655.40 was found in his pants pocket. A plastic bag containing 52 tablets of Ecstasy was found in the driver’s side pocket of the respondent’s motor vehicle. These tablets were the subject of count 3. 
      
       
     14 A search warrant was later executed on the respondent’s unit. He had been informed that this was to take place, and as a consequence he informed police that there was cannabis and MDMA in the premises. He indicated their location. 
      
       
     15 In the course of the search the police located 550 Ecstasy tablets, which became the subject of count 4, and the small quantity of cannabis leaf, which was included in the schedule. 
      
       
     16 Mr W was sentenced on a single charge of supply a prohibited drug (deemed) to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. Mr Nicodin still awaits trial. 
      
       
     17 By reason of the significantly different activities in which the respondent and these other persons were involved, their cases provide no assistance, to my mind, by way of parity. 
      
       
     18 The estimated street value of the drugs the subject of the various charges was noted by his Honour as follows: 
      
       
       Count 1 $ 50,000 
        
       Count 2 $ 20,000 
        
       Count 3 $ 2,080 
        
       Count 4  
       $ 22,000 
        
       TOTAL $ 94,080 
        
        
       SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     19 In sentencing the respondent, his Honour took into account evidence from Janette Fleming, as well as a report from Mr Robertson who belonged to an organisation referred to as The Dependency Counselling and Report Service. 
      
       
     20 In summary, Miss Fleming said the respondent had assisted her son while he was an inmate at Cessnock Gaol and that he had been a visitor to their home while on work release, during which time he had provided additional help. She expressed an interest in now assisting him. 
      
       
     21 The report from Mr Robertson was received without objection from the Crown. For that reason, I consider we should also have regard to it, although I have very serious doubts concerning its admissibility. While the author claimed qualifications by a Post Graduate Diploma in Clinical Drug Dependency from some unidentified institution, and also claimed experience in working with several non-Government organisations in relation to drug use and dependency, the report went well beyond this into areas properly falling within the fields of psychology and/or psychiatry, for which no qualifications were shown to exist on the material before his Honour. 
      
       
     22 Care needs to be taken in the reception of material of this kind: See my observations in R v Moore NSWCCA 23 April 1998 relating to the use of reports from criminologists offered in aid of sentencing, lest such reports become a vehicle for placing before the Court material outside the author’s area of expertise, or which would otherwise be of a hearsay kind concerning an offender’s personal circumstances. 
      
       
     23 The latter kind of material should properly be led from the offender or from a qualified person, such as a psychologist or officers of the Probation and Parole Service, or of Juvenile Justice, who routinely prepare background or pre-sentence reports which are of considerable value and assistance to the Court. Otherwise, the vehicle of a report should not be used so as to take advantage of the technical rules of evidence which permit the reception of hearsay evidence. It is essential that persons who prepare reports for use in Court be properly qualified and that they confine their observations and comments to their area of specialty. 
      
       
     24 Notwithstanding those observations, I will note that in the course of his report Mr Robertson offered, inter alia, the somewhat tentative opinion that the use of substances by the respondent: 
      
       
        
         
         “...  
         might 
          have created some deluded and grandiose thinking which could have contributed to his decision to become involved in this activity; that ‘this introduction to stimulant substances was a mechanism to deal with his inability to assert himself, his isolation and his perception of himself’, and that ‘he seemed easily led and had an over-developed sense of responsibility to please people. Thus his lack of assertiveness.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     25 It is to those paragraphs in his report – which no doubt were the reason for its tender – that my reservations attach. However, for the reasons mentioned, on this occasion I will assume that the material was properly to be taken into account. 
      
       
     26 Otherwise, it was shown that the respondent was aged forty-seven years, that he was in a stable relationship with a woman with whom he has a young son, that he had come to Australia from Singapore in 1973 in order to seek a better life, that he had a history of drug use (cocaine and Ecstasy) extending over the three years following his earlier release on parole, and that he had a strong relationship with a supporting family. 
      
       
     27 Mr Robertson’s report suggested he had a lot of shame in relation to his drug use and the current matters. He also understood that the respondent had worked consistently in this country in the hospitality and restaurant industry and had undertaken various TAFE courses. 
      
       
        
       THE SENTENCES 
       
     28 In sentencing the respondent his Honour accepted the submission advanced, which was conceded by the Crown at trial, that the sentences imposed should be served concurrently with one another. This was because the offences were considered to be part of a continuing and interconnected episode centred on the day of arrest. One may have some reservations in relation to that approach, having regard in particular to the movements of the respondent on that day, and the finding of drugs at his home, along with the possession by him of considerable sums in cash. However, it is not a matter which I consider should now attract our attention, having regard to the Crown’s concession. That is, of course, subject to the need to ensure that the sentencing order, as a whole, did reflect the total criminality involved and was framed in accordance with the principles established in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
      
       
     29 In accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (hereafter referred to as The Sentencing Act) his Honour found special circumstances to exist referable, it would appear, to the respondent’s motivation to rehabilitate himself. That would seem to have been related to the fact he had a young son, and to Miss Fleming’s offer of assistance, to him. Additionally, it appears to have depended upon an observation in Mr Robertson’s report that he was seen to be using his time in custody positively and constructively, a matter which he said was attributable to his vision of a developing relationship with his son and partner. 
      
       
     30 I would add that Mr Robertson’s observations in this regard appear to have been based on a short conference on a single occasion lasting for two hours. 
      
       
     31 His Honour made no express reference in the reasons for sentence to the utilitarian value of the pleas, which obviously were pleas offered at the earliest moment, as he should have done in accordance with s 22 of the Sentencing Act. Nor did he make mention of the respondent’s co-operation with the police in informing them where they might find the Ecstasy and cannabis at his home. It may, however, be assumed from the sentences that these matters were not overlooked, particularly as they were emphasised during the submissions on sentence. 
      
       
        
       THE APPEAL 
       
     32 The Crown submitted the sentences were manifestly inadequate, and suggested that this has occurred as a result of his Honour giving too much significance to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, while failing to reflect by way of deterrence and punishment the fact that he was trafficking in drugs for financial gain and had re-offended while on parole for serious drug offences. It was further submitted that his Honour erred in finding special circumstances which led to him fixing a non-parole period for count 1 which was two-thirds of the head sentence. 
      
       
     33 It is well established that this Court should not interfere with a sentence on a Crown appeal merely because it is of a view that it is less than that which the Court would have itself imposed. See House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 409 at 504 and see also Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. 
      
       
     34 An appellate court may only interfere if it is shown that the sentencing judge fell into a material error of law or fact, a test which may be met where the sentence is so far outside a legitimate range of sentencing discretion that error must be assumed, even though it is not otherwise apparent on the face of the reasons for sentence. See The Queen v Wong 76 ALJR 79 at 90, per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 
      
       
     35 In the present case the respondent was clearly entitled to a discount towards the top of the range suggested in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, having regard to the utilitarian value of that plea and his co-operation with police. 
      
       
     36 Of greater significance, however, in this case is the circumstance that the current offences were committed while the respondent was on parole for very serious drug offences which had seen him spend seven years in gaol and only shortly after he had received a formal warning as to the consequences of re-offending. His betrayal of parole was a matter which had to be regarded very seriously, for the reasons discussed in R v Daridis NSWCCA 18 December 1986, R v Plocharsky NSWCCA 14 September 1988 and R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181. 
      
       
     37 As Badgery-Parker J observed in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 128, the offender in such circumstances should: 
      
       
        
         
         “... not only suffer the revocation of his parole with the consequent need to serve out the balance of the head sentence but should also suffer a significant punishment for later offences to mark the gravity of his conduct in thus abusing his parole.” 
         
        
       
     38 The present case was one where the further offences, particularly in the light of the unequivocal caution, to my mind, indicated a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law warranting a condign sentence on the basis of punishment, retribution and deterrence, for the reasons discussed in R v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152. 
      
       
     39 Both MDMA and methylamphetamine are mid-range drugs and the respondent was trafficking in them for profit, a factor which is a significant element in weighing his objective criminality. See R v Marie (1983) 13 A Crim R 440.  
      
       
     40 It was no excuse that his motive was to get a “head start” because of his need to provide an adequate lifestyle for his partner and the impending birth of his child, as he reported to Mr Robertson. His Honour appears to me not to have given sufficient consideration to these factors, or to the principle that, when matters are taken into account on a schedule, it remains necessary to reflect their existence in the penalty imposed for the charged offences. See R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 and R v Gould [1999] NSWCCA 177. 
      
       
     41 While it is true that the further offences have had the effect of causing the respondent’s return to prison to serve out the balance of his parole, and while he is not to be additionally punished for the earlier offences (R v Kaiva, NSWCCA, 9 November 1998), the present case remains one where the fact of him reoffending on parole needed to be taken into account in relation to totality: R v Hajjo NSWCCA 31 August 1992. 
      
       
     42 In all these circumstances, little of assistance is gained from reference to sentencing statistics or other sentencing decisions for offences of supply of methylamphetamine or of MDMA. Inevitably, there is a wide range of objective and subjective circumstances encountered in other cases, which can be masked by a bare reference to a collection of statistics, or by a reference to individual cases which do not share the critical feature of re-offending while on conditional liberty, following the imposition of sentences for serious drug offences. 
      
       
     43 By reason of these considerations, I have reached the conclusion that the sentences passed were manifestly inadequate and did not reflect the punitive, deterrent and other considerations which should have been taken into account. In my view, his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the respondent was trafficking in a significant way for personal and financial gain, and while on parole. 
      
       
     44 I have given careful consideration to the question of double jeopardy and to the discretion which attaches to Crown appeals, as established in Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293, R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 and Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295. 
      
       
     45 I am unpersuaded that the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation or any other identifiable factor should cause the Court in the exercise of its discretion to decline to intervene. However, it remains true that if the Court elects to re-sentence, then the sentence imposed should normally be one towards the lower end of the range of sentences which could properly have been passed at first instance: see Dinsdale v The Queen, at para 62 per Kirby J. 
      
       
     46 I would accordingly propose that the sentences below be quashed and that in lieu thereof the respondent be sentenced as follows: 
      
       
       Count 1 
        
       Taking into account the offence on the schedule, imprisonment for seven and a half years to commence from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 July 2008. I would fix a non-parole period of five years, similarly to commence from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2006. 
        
       Counts 2 and 3 
        
       Imprisonment in respect of each count for a fixed term of four years, similarly to commence from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2005.  
        
       Count 4 
        
       Imprisonment for six years to commence on 9 January 2001. I would fix a non-parole period in respect of this count of four years, similarly to commence from 9 January 2001 and to expire on 8 January 2005. 
        
       
     47 Upon that basis the earliest date upon which the respondent would be eligible for release on parole would be 9 January 2006. 
      
       
     48 In view of the concession made below and in exercise of discretion, I would direct the sentences be served concurrently rather than partially cumulatively upon each other. 
      
       
     49 By reason of the way in which the sentences should, in my view, be structured, I would decline to fix a non-parole period in respect of the sentences in respect of counts 2 and 3. 
      
       
     50 I would not disturb the finding of special circumstances made below. Consistently with the decision in this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, it was proper to have regard to the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation, and to his need for ongoing supervision in relation to his history of drug use, and also so as to foster his lawful return to the community after a second significant period of imprisonment. 
      
       
     51 It is in those circumstances appropriate, in my view, to retain the proportion between the non-parole period and head sentence which his Honour had determined. 
      
       
     52 SULLY J: I agree with the entirety of what has been said by the Chief Judge and with the orders his Honour proposes. 
      
       
     53 DOWD J: I also agree. 
      
       
     54 WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Her Honour: By notice of motion filed on 15 October 2001 the applicant seeks leave to withdraw pleas of guilty he entered on 24 May 2001 to six charges on an indictment. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    2 On 31 July 2000 the applicant was arrested and charged in relation to a series of sexual assaults and robberies said to have been committed over a period between 5 September 1998 and 7 July 2000, and involving eight different female complainants. He was committed to stand trial in this court. The trial was fixed to commence on 7 May 2001, with an estimate of six weeks. Altogether, at that time, the applicant faced twenty-one charges. These were counts of detaining for advantage (four counts); aggravated sexual assault (five counts); attempted sexual assault (three counts); armed robbery (eight counts); indecent assault (one count).  3 Shortly before the trial was due to commence the applicant filed a notice of motion challenging the admission of a large volume of the evidence the Crown intended to adduce, and seeking, in alternative ways, separation of the trials in relation to various charges. The first two weeks of the allocated trial dates were occupied with a voir dire, during which evidence was taken and argument was heard relating to the notice of motion. Determination of the many issues raised by the notice of motion involved review of most of the Crown evidence. It is the subject of detailed reasons for my decision. In summary, I ruled that all challenged evidence would be admitted, and refused to separate the trials of any of the charges. The reasons for judgment are dated 14 September 2001. However, I announced my rulings, and delivered a written summary, on 22 May 2001. The trial, before a jury, was then expected to commence shortly thereafter. In the meantime the applicant, through his legal representatives, indicated his intention to plead guilty to certain charges. When indicted on 24 May the applicant entered pleas of guilty to six counts – two of sexual intercourse without consent, two of armed robbery, and two of detaining for advantage. These charges related to the assaults on and robberies of two of the complainants. Pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the applicant indicated that he wanted the court to take into account a further 13 offences, of which he expressly admitted his guilt. These were all but two of the offences with which he had previously been charged, involving the assaults on five of the remaining complainants. The charges relating to the eighth complainant were not pursued in these proceedings. 4 The transcript records that, following the procedure prescribed by s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I found the applicant guilty of each of the offences on the indictment, asked him if he admitted his guilt of the further offences listed on the Form 1, and whether he wished the court to take those further offences into account in dealing with the offences on the indictment. To each of these questions the applicant answered in the affirmative. His counsel, Mr Turnbull, had been given leave to assist the applicant, and was standing by the dock at the time of this procedure. He had earlier had a conference with the applicant, in the cells attached to the court.5 A date was fixed for hearing of matters relevant to sentence. Before that hearing could take place the applicant terminated the retainer of his legal representatives and communicated a wish to withdraw his pleas of guilty. He has now made a formal application to do so.6 The principles to be applied to the determination of an application to reverse a plea of guilty have been stated many times. Counsel who appeared for the applicant on this application referred to the decision of the High Court in Meissner v R (1995) 184 CLR 132 and particularly to the single judgment of Dawson J, at p 157. There his Honour referred to circumstances in which a conviction may be set aside following a plea of guilty, saying that that would not occur unless it was shown that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that, ordinarily, that would only occur where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit his guilt, or if, on the facts admitted by the plea, he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. However, his Honour recognised that other circumstances may give rise to a miscarriage of justice such as to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty such as where it is shown that the plea was produced by intimidation, improper inducement or by fraud.7 Meissner was a case principally concerned with attempts to pervert the course of justice, but the principles stated by Dawson J are well recognised as those relevant to an application to reverse a plea of guilty. The Court of Criminal Appeal has, in the last two years, had to deal with the issue on a number of occasions, and the principles have been re-stated. Decisions include R v Marchando [2000] NSWCCA 8 (unreported, 11 February 2000); R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97 (unreported, 21 March 2000); R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 (unreported, 19 September 2001). As I observed in Marchando, the central question is always whether it is shown that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a consciousness of guilt (at [4]). Authority for that proposition is to be found in R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481. Reference was also made to R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 (unreported, 10 August 2001). In that case, Smart AJ reviewed a number of authorities. I have reread these authorities and reminded myself of the relevant legal principles.8 On 6 December 2001, the hearing of his application to withdraw the pleas of guilty commenced. The applicant gave oral evidence. He stated that he had entered his pleas of guilty whilst in a state of confusion as a result of the consumption of drugs (valium and marijuana). He said he had no recollection of entering the pleas, and had not been aware of what he was doing. The tenor of his evidence was a denial that his pleas were truly attributable to a consciousness of guilt.9 He said that he became aware that he had pleaded guilty only after he had returned to prison. He said that the following day other prisoners read to him newspaper reports of the proceedings and the pleas.10 From time to time during his evidence he volunteered that he was not guilty of the offences. 
     
      
    11 The applicant also claimed that, almost from the commencement of his representation, pressure had been brought to bear upon him to plead guilty to the charges. He maintained that he withstood this pressure insisting that he was not the perpetrator of the crimes. His lawyers, each of whom gave evidence, denied having applied such pressure, but agreed that the implications of a plea of guilty had been considered and discussed from time to time. In the light of the evidence in the Crown case, to which I will shortly refer, it was a perfectly legitimate, proper and responsible course for his legal representatives to discuss with the applicant the prospects, and the potential benefits, of a plea of guilty. Even taking the applicant’s evidence at its highest, I do not accept that there was any undue or improper pressure brought to bear upon him. It was the duty of the legal representatives to bring home to him the strength of the case which he was facing, and the benefit he could achieve by acknowledging his guilt.12 Both the solicitor and the barrister who had represented the applicant up to the time he entered his pleas of guilty were called to give evidence in the Crown’s response to the applicant’s claim. From their accounts emerged a chronology which may here be briefly stated. As noted above, my rulings on the disputed evidentiary matters were delivered (in writing, but without detailed reasons) on 22 May. On 23 May the two legal representatives, together with a third, anticipating that the trial would commence on or about 24 May, spent a good part of the day inspecting the various locations where the offences were said to have been committed. During the afternoon, probably relatively late in the afternoon, they attended at the Silverwater Prison, where the applicant was being held, to confer with him. At this time, on their evidence, both expected that the trial would continue and the applicant would enter pleas of not guilty. However, during the conference, the question of a change of plea was raised. The applicant asked the two counsel to leave him alone with the solicitor for a time and further discussions took place. The counsel returned and, eventually, the applicant gave instructions that he would plead guilty. It should here be observed that discussions between the representatives of the Crown and of the applicant had preceded all of these events, including the delivery of rulings, and the arrangement (which eventuated) of an indictment containing six charges, with the remainder of the allegations to be dealt with by way of Form 1 pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, had been canvassed. It was this arrangement that the applicant agreed to. 
     
      
    13 In relation to the conference at Silverwater on 23 May, Mr Turnbull said that he had made a note that the applicant was “red eyed and subdued”. Mr Adamson, the solicitor, described him as “deflated”. Mr Adamson remembered his demeanour on 24 May, the day the applicant entered his pleas, as “agitated”. 
     
      
    14 However, Mr Turnbull was adamant that the applicant was alert and proactive during the Silverwater conference, that there was no apparent cause for concern in his demeanour on 24 May, and that he (Mr Turnbull) took steps to satisfy himself, and did satisfy himself, that the applicant was fully conversant with the proposal that was put to him and fully understood it. The evidence of both lawyers was that extensive discussions took place before the applicant decided to plead guilty. Neither observed any signs that the applicant was affected by drugs, whether medicinal or illicit. I am satisfied that he fully understood the implications of the advice he was given, the discussions about the merits of entering pleas of guilty and the prospects of acquittal, and that the applicant decided to plead guilty essentially because of the strength of the Crown case, and the benefits he could receive from the course he ultimately took. At heart, this was because the applicant acknowledged his guilt of the offences, an acknowledgment expressly reinforced when he was questioned in court. 
     
      
    15 I have no doubt that the applicant’s decision was, to a large extent, influenced by the adverse voir dire rulings. However, he did not at any time claim that his capacity to make a reasoned judgment was affected by shock or disappointment at the result. The decision he made was, above all, a realistic one. 
     
      
    16 An attempt was made to make something of the accounts of the applicant’s demeanour but, in my view, it takes only a moment’s thought to understand why the applicant would have been in a condition such as to warrant these descriptions. A lengthy voir dire, in which he had plainly hoped to exclude some, if not most, of the Crown evidence, had occupied a good deal of the recent past, and a result which was entirely unfavourable to him had been delivered. It must have been obvious that this decision was devastating to his prospects of an acquittal on any or all of the charges he faced. Further, the applicant was facing the prospect of admitting to the commission of a large number of very serious, very violent crimes; and a lengthy period of imprisonment. It is little wonder that he was emotionally dislocated. However, that does not imply that he was not fully conscious of the decision he took and its ramifications, nor that his decision to plead guilty was not made for proper reasons: that is, that he knew that he was guilty of the offences to which he pleaded guilty, (and the additional offences of which he admitted his guilt). 
     
      
    17 Criticism was made of the legal representatives, in particular the solicitor, in relation to notes taken (or in some cases not taken) during the conferences. However, this does not persuade me that there was any pressure, impropriety, or influence that could be said to affect the integrity of the applicant’s pleas. The applicant had to face the reality of the cases he was facing. 
     
      
    18 I do not accept that the applicant was not fully aware of what he was doing when he entered his pleas of guilty. In this respect, I am entitled to take into account the strength of the Crown case, with which I have a more than usual familiarity by reason the extensive matters canvassed on the voir dire. The reasons for judgment demonstrate the detailed examination that was made of the Crown evidence. In my opinion the applicant legitimately pursued his options in challenging the admission of that evidence, but, having failed to achieve the exclusion of any of the evidence, he recognised the strong likelihood of conviction, and was made aware the benefit that could still accrue to him if he were to plead guilty. I am fully conscious that there is a distinction between making a firm decision to plead guilty because of the recognition of the inevitability, or probability, of conviction, and a decision to plead guilty because of a consciousness of guilt. In relation to the latter, the strength of the Crown case is not an irrelevant consideration. I am quite satisfied, having regard to the Crown case, as well as to the evidence adduced in support of the application, that the applicant entered his pleas because he was fully aware that he was guilty of the offences charged. There is no other discretionary reason why he should be permitted to withdraw pleas of guilty properly entered. According, the application is dismissed.

      S70001/01 - REGINA v Anthony James DALEY  
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Her Honour: By notice of motion filed on 15 October 2001 the applicant seeks leave to withdraw pleas of guilty he entered on 24 May 2001 to six charges on an indictment. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    2 On 31 July 2000 the applicant was arrested and charged in relation to a series of sexual assaults and robberies said to have been committed over a period between 5 September 1998 and 7 July 2000, and involving eight different female complainants. He was committed to stand trial in this court. The trial was fixed to commence on 7 May 2001, with an estimate of six weeks. Altogether, at that time, the applicant faced twenty-one charges. These were counts of detaining for advantage (four counts); aggravated sexual assault (five counts); attempted sexual assault (three counts); armed robbery (eight counts); indecent assault (one count).  3 Shortly before the trial was due to commence the applicant filed a notice of motion challenging the admission of a large volume of the evidence the Crown intended to adduce, and seeking, in alternative ways, separation of the trials in relation to various charges. The first two weeks of the allocated trial dates were occupied with a voir dire, during which evidence was taken and argument was heard relating to the notice of motion. Determination of the many issues raised by the notice of motion involved review of most of the Crown evidence. It is the subject of detailed reasons for my decision. In summary, I ruled that all challenged evidence would be admitted, and refused to separate the trials of any of the charges. The reasons for judgment are dated 14 September 2001. However, I announced my rulings, and delivered a written summary, on 22 May 2001. The trial, before a jury, was then expected to commence shortly thereafter. In the meantime the applicant, through his legal representatives, indicated his intention to plead guilty to certain charges. When indicted on 24 May the applicant entered pleas of guilty to six counts – two of sexual intercourse without consent, two of armed robbery, and two of detaining for advantage. These charges related to the assaults on and robberies of two of the complainants. Pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the applicant indicated that he wanted the court to take into account a further 13 offences, of which he expressly admitted his guilt. These were all but two of the offences with which he had previously been charged, involving the assaults on five of the remaining complainants. The charges relating to the eighth complainant were not pursued in these proceedings. 4 The transcript records that, following the procedure prescribed by s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I found the applicant guilty of each of the offences on the indictment, asked him if he admitted his guilt of the further offences listed on the Form 1, and whether he wished the court to take those further offences into account in dealing with the offences on the indictment. To each of these questions the applicant answered in the affirmative. His counsel, Mr Turnbull, had been given leave to assist the applicant, and was standing by the dock at the time of this procedure. He had earlier had a conference with the applicant, in the cells attached to the court.5 A date was fixed for hearing of matters relevant to sentence. Before that hearing could take place the applicant terminated the retainer of his legal representatives and communicated a wish to withdraw his pleas of guilty. He has now made a formal application to do so.6 The principles to be applied to the determination of an application to reverse a plea of guilty have been stated many times. Counsel who appeared for the applicant on this application referred to the decision of the High Court in Meissner v R (1995) 184 CLR 132 and particularly to the single judgment of Dawson J, at p 157. There his Honour referred to circumstances in which a conviction may be set aside following a plea of guilty, saying that that would not occur unless it was shown that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, and that, ordinarily, that would only occur where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit his guilt, or if, on the facts admitted by the plea, he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. However, his Honour recognised that other circumstances may give rise to a miscarriage of justice such as to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty such as where it is shown that the plea was produced by intimidation, improper inducement or by fraud.7 Meissner was a case principally concerned with attempts to pervert the course of justice, but the principles stated by Dawson J are well recognised as those relevant to an application to reverse a plea of guilty. The Court of Criminal Appeal has, in the last two years, had to deal with the issue on a number of occasions, and the principles have been re-stated. Decisions include R v Marchando [2000] NSWCCA 8 (unreported, 11 February 2000); R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97 (unreported, 21 March 2000); R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273 (unreported, 19 September 2001). As I observed in Marchando, the central question is always whether it is shown that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a consciousness of guilt (at [4]). Authority for that proposition is to be found in R v Davies (1993) 19 MVR 481. Reference was also made to R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 (unreported, 10 August 2001). In that case, Smart AJ reviewed a number of authorities. I have reread these authorities and reminded myself of the relevant legal principles.8 On 6 December 2001, the hearing of his application to withdraw the pleas of guilty commenced. The applicant gave oral evidence. He stated that he had entered his pleas of guilty whilst in a state of confusion as a result of the consumption of drugs (valium and marijuana). He said he had no recollection of entering the pleas, and had not been aware of what he was doing. The tenor of his evidence was a denial that his pleas were truly attributable to a consciousness of guilt.9 He said that he became aware that he had pleaded guilty only after he had returned to prison. He said that the following day other prisoners read to him newspaper reports of the proceedings and the pleas.10 From time to time during his evidence he volunteered that he was not guilty of the offences. 
     
      
    11 The applicant also claimed that, almost from the commencement of his representation, pressure had been brought to bear upon him to plead guilty to the charges. He maintained that he withstood this pressure insisting that he was not the perpetrator of the crimes. His lawyers, each of whom gave evidence, denied having applied such pressure, but agreed that the implications of a plea of guilty had been considered and discussed from time to time. In the light of the evidence in the Crown case, to which I will shortly refer, it was a perfectly legitimate, proper and responsible course for his legal representatives to discuss with the applicant the prospects, and the potential benefits, of a plea of guilty. Even taking the applicant’s evidence at its highest, I do not accept that there was any undue or improper pressure brought to bear upon him. It was the duty of the legal representatives to bring home to him the strength of the case which he was facing, and the benefit he could achieve by acknowledging his guilt.12 Both the solicitor and the barrister who had represented the applicant up to the time he entered his pleas of guilty were called to give evidence in the Crown’s response to the applicant’s claim. From their accounts emerged a chronology which may here be briefly stated. As noted above, my rulings on the disputed evidentiary matters were delivered (in writing, but without detailed reasons) on 22 May. On 23 May the two legal representatives, together with a third, anticipating that the trial would commence on or about 24 May, spent a good part of the day inspecting the various locations where the offences were said to have been committed. During the afternoon, probably relatively late in the afternoon, they attended at the Silverwater Prison, where the applicant was being held, to confer with him. At this time, on their evidence, both expected that the trial would continue and the applicant would enter pleas of not guilty. However, during the conference, the question of a change of plea was raised. The applicant asked the two counsel to leave him alone with the solicitor for a time and further discussions took place. The counsel returned and, eventually, the applicant gave instructions that he would plead guilty. It should here be observed that discussions between the representatives of the Crown and of the applicant had preceded all of these events, including the delivery of rulings, and the arrangement (which eventuated) of an indictment containing six charges, with the remainder of the allegations to be dealt with by way of Form 1 pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, had been canvassed. It was this arrangement that the applicant agreed to. 
     
      
    13 In relation to the conference at Silverwater on 23 May, Mr Turnbull said that he had made a note that the applicant was “red eyed and subdued”. Mr Adamson, the solicitor, described him as “deflated”. Mr Adamson remembered his demeanour on 24 May, the day the applicant entered his pleas, as “agitated”. 
     
      
    14 However, Mr Turnbull was adamant that the applicant was alert and proactive during the Silverwater conference, that there was no apparent cause for concern in his demeanour on 24 May, and that he (Mr Turnbull) took steps to satisfy himself, and did satisfy himself, that the applicant was fully conversant with the proposal that was put to him and fully understood it. The evidence of both lawyers was that extensive discussions took place before the applicant decided to plead guilty. Neither observed any signs that the applicant was affected by drugs, whether medicinal or illicit. I am satisfied that he fully understood the implications of the advice he was given, the discussions about the merits of entering pleas of guilty and the prospects of acquittal, and that the applicant decided to plead guilty essentially because of the strength of the Crown case, and the benefits he could receive from the course he ultimately took. At heart, this was because the applicant acknowledged his guilt of the offences, an acknowledgment expressly reinforced when he was questioned in court. 
     
      
    15 I have no doubt that the applicant’s decision was, to a large extent, influenced by the adverse voir dire rulings. However, he did not at any time claim that his capacity to make a reasoned judgment was affected by shock or disappointment at the result. The decision he made was, above all, a realistic one. 
     
      
    16 An attempt was made to make something of the accounts of the applicant’s demeanour but, in my view, it takes only a moment’s thought to understand why the applicant would have been in a condition such as to warrant these descriptions. A lengthy voir dire, in which he had plainly hoped to exclude some, if not most, of the Crown evidence, had occupied a good deal of the recent past, and a result which was entirely unfavourable to him had been delivered. It must have been obvious that this decision was devastating to his prospects of an acquittal on any or all of the charges he faced. Further, the applicant was facing the prospect of admitting to the commission of a large number of very serious, very violent crimes; and a lengthy period of imprisonment. It is little wonder that he was emotionally dislocated. However, that does not imply that he was not fully conscious of the decision he took and its ramifications, nor that his decision to plead guilty was not made for proper reasons: that is, that he knew that he was guilty of the offences to which he pleaded guilty, (and the additional offences of which he admitted his guilt). 
     
      
    17 Criticism was made of the legal representatives, in particular the solicitor, in relation to notes taken (or in some cases not taken) during the conferences. However, this does not persuade me that there was any pressure, impropriety, or influence that could be said to affect the integrity of the applicant’s pleas. The applicant had to face the reality of the cases he was facing. 
     
      
    18 I do not accept that the applicant was not fully aware of what he was doing when he entered his pleas of guilty. In this respect, I am entitled to take into account the strength of the Crown case, with which I have a more than usual familiarity by reason the extensive matters canvassed on the voir dire. The reasons for judgment demonstrate the detailed examination that was made of the Crown evidence. In my opinion the applicant legitimately pursued his options in challenging the admission of that evidence, but, having failed to achieve the exclusion of any of the evidence, he recognised the strong likelihood of conviction, and was made aware the benefit that could still accrue to him if he were to plead guilty. I am fully conscious that there is a distinction between making a firm decision to plead guilty because of the recognition of the inevitability, or probability, of conviction, and a decision to plead guilty because of a consciousness of guilt. In relation to the latter, the strength of the Crown case is not an irrelevant consideration. I am quite satisfied, having regard to the Crown case, as well as to the evidence adduced in support of the application, that the applicant entered his pleas because he was fully aware that he was guilty of the offences charged. There is no other discretionary reason why he should be permitted to withdraw pleas of guilty properly entered. According, the application is dismissed.

      REGINA (COMMONWEALTH) v ZIVKO BUNEVSKI 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: In these proceedings the appellant has raised a ground of appeal to the effect that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that certain evidence, adduced in the cross examination of the appellant, based upon an excluded record of interview was not admissible against him, but could only be used in respect to his credibility. 
      
       
     2 A similar point arose for consideration by this Court in R v Rahme [2001] NSWCCA 414 in relation to a co-accused. The Court there said: 
      
       
        
         
         “37. The jury were given no directions as to the limited use to which they might put the cross-examination of the appellant based upon his excluded record of interview. The passage from the summing up that I have just quoted must have reinforced in their mind the propriety of making general use of any evidence adduced in the cross-examination of the appellant, including cross-examination referring to and based upon the appellant’s answers in the excluded record of interview.  
         
        
        
         
         38. In these circumstances, there must be a new trial, because Bunevski’s counsel put before the jury ‘evidence of an admission’ by the appellant that was excluded by s84 of the Evidence Act and because of the real possibility that the jury relied upon this evidence in proceeding to their guilty verdict against the appellant.  
         
        
        
         
         …  
         
        
        
         
         42. When counsel for Bunevski got the appellant to agree with the contents of the record of interview in circumstances where those answers were put before the jury; and when those answers were used to attack the appellant’s credibility as a witness in the trial generally and thereby to undermine his own case that it had been Bunevski who duped him, the ‘previous representation’ embodied in the excluded record of interview was being used in a manner adverse to the appellant’s interest in the outcome of his trial (see R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426).  
         
        
        
         
         … 
          
          
         43. The questioning should not have been permitted and the jury should not have been left free to use it inter alia to the detriment of the appellant’s case.” 
         
        
        
       
     3 In the light of that decision it is conceded by the Crown that ground 2 is made out, that the conviction should be set aside, and that a new trial should be ordered. 
      
       
     4 It is not submitted by the appellant that any other orders should be made and, accordingly, I would propose that orders be made in the terms conceded by the Crown.  
      
       
     5 SULLY J: I agree. 
      
       
     6 DOWD J: I agree.  
      
       
     7 WOOD CJ at CL: The orders of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     IAN JOHN VAN HUISSTEDE AND THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE. 
      
      
     Application by Ian John Van Huisstede pursuant to section 181E of the  
     Police Service Act 
      1990. 
      
      
      DECISION 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     This is an application by Ian John Van Huisstede (""the applicant"") for a review of an order made by the Commissioner of Police (""the Commissioner"") pursuant to s181D(1) of the  
     Police Service Act 
      1990 (""the Act"") on 5 January 1999 (""the order"") removing the applicant from the Police Service of New South Wales (""the Police Service"").  
      
       
      
     2     
     The application specified that the respondent in the proceedings was the ""Commissioner of Police, New South Wales Police Service"", although the applicant nominated the ""Commissioner of Police"" as his employer in the initiating process. The parties later clarified that the proper respondent in the proceedings was the Commissioner of Police. The application is amended accordingly.  
      
       
      
     3     
     The proceedings are governed by Division 1B of Part 9 of the Act. Section 181E provides that a police officer may apply to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales (""the Commission"") for a review of an order removing a police officer from the Police Service on the grounds that the removal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. By operation of s181G(1) of the Act, the provisions of the  
     Industrial Relations Act  
     1996 (""the IR Act"") apply to the application for review, subject to some stated limitations, in the same way as those provisions apply to an application brought under Part 6 of Chapter 2 of the IR Act.  
      
       
      
     The Applicable Legislation 
      
       
      
     4     
     Section 181D of the Act provides as follows: 
      
       
        
        181D Commissioner may remove police officers 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) The Commissioner may, by order in writing, remove a police officer from the Police Service if the Commissioner does not have confidence in the police officer's suitability to continue as a police officer, having regard to the police officer's competence, integrity, performance or conduct.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (2) Action may not be taken under subsection (1) in relation to a Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner except with the approval of the Minister.  
          
          
         (3) Before making an order under this section, the Commissioner: 
          
          
           
           (a) must give the police officer a notice setting out the grounds on which the Commissioner does not have confidence in the officer's suitability to continue as a police officer, and 
           
          
          
           
           (b) must give the police officer 21 days within which to make written submissions to the Commissioner in relation to the proposed action, and 
           
          
          
           
           (c) must take into consideration any written submissions received from the police officer during that period. 
           
          
          
         (4) The order must set out the reasons for which the Commissioner has decided to remove the police officer from the Police Service.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (5) The removal takes effect when the order is made.  
          
          
         (6) (Repealed) 
          
          
         (7) Except as provided by Division 1C: 
          
          
           
           (a) no tribunal has jurisdiction or power to review or consider any decision or order of the Commissioner under this section, and 
           
          
          
           
           (b) no appeal lies to any tribunal in connection with any decision or order of the Commissioner under this section.  
           
          
          
           
           In this subsection, tribunal means a court, tribunal or administrative review body, and (without limitation) includes GREAT and the Industrial Relations Commission.  
           
          
          
         (7A) Nothing in this section, limits or otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review administrative action.  
          
          
         (7B) Nothing in Division 1C limits or otherwise affects the Commissioner's power to vary or revoke an order in force under this section.  
          
          
         (8) For the purposes of this Act, removal of a police officer from the Police Service under this section has the same effect as if the police officer has resigned (or, in the case of a police officer who is of or above the age of 55 years, had retired) from the Police Service.  
          
          
         (9) The Commissioner may take action under this section despite any action with respect to the removal or dismissal of the police officer that is in progress under some other provision of this Act and despite the decision of any court with respect to any such action.  
         
        
       
      
     5     
     Sections 181E, 181F, 181G and 181H generally concern a review of a decision of the Commissioner made pursuant to s181D. Those sections are in the following terms: 
      
       
        
       181E Review generally 
        
        
         
         (1) A police officer who is removed from the Police Service by an order under section 181D may apply to the Industrial Relations Commission (referred to in this Division as the Commission) for a review of the order on the ground that the removal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust.  
         
        
        
         
         (2) An application under this section does not operate to stay the operation of the order in respect of which it is made.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) Except to the extent to which the regulations otherwise provide, it is the duty of the Commissioner to make available to the applicant all of the documents and the other material on which the Commissioner has relied in deciding that the Commissioner does not have confidence in the applicant's suitability to continue as a police officer, as referred to in section 181D (1).  
         
        
        
        
         
         181F Proceedings on a review 
         
        
        
         
         (1) In conducting a review under this Division, the Commission must proceed as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) firstly, it must consider the Commissioner's reasons for the decision to remove the applicant from the Police Service, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) secondly, it must consider the case presented by the applicant as to why the removal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) thirdly, it must consider the case presented by the Commissioner in answer to the applicant's case.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The applicant has at all times the burden of establishing that the removal of the applicant from the Police Service is harsh, unreasonable or unjust. This subsection has effect despite any law or practice to the contrary.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) Without limiting the matters to which the Commission is otherwise required or permitted to have regard in making its decision, the Commission must have regard to: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) the interests of the applicant, and 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the public interest (which is taken to include the interest of maintaining the integrity of the Police Service, and the fact that the Commissioner made the order pursuant to section 181D (1)).  
           
          
         
        
        
        
         
         181G Application of Industrial Relations Act 1996 to reviews  
         
        
        
         
         (1) The provisions of the  
         Industrial Relations Act  
         1996 apply to an application for a review under this Division in the same way as they apply to an application under Part 6 (Unfair dismissals) of Chapter 2 of that Act, subject to this division and to the following modifications: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) section 83 (Application of Part) is to be read as if subsection (3) were omitted, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) section 85 (Time for making applications) is to be read: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) as if a reference to 21 days in that section were instead a reference to 14 days, starting from the day on which the applicant is given a copy of the order to which the application relates, and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) as if subsection (3) were omitted, 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) section 86 (Conciliation of applications) is to be read as if it provided that a judicial member of the Commission who is involved in any endeavour to settle the applicant's claim by conciliation must not subsequently be involved in the conduct of proceedings on the review,  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) section 89 is to be read as if subsection (7) (Threat of dismissal) were omitted, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) section 162 (Procedure generally) is to be read as if the requirement of subsection (2) (a) of that section that the Commission is to act as quickly as is practicable were instead a requirement for the Commission to commence hearing the application within 4 weeks after the application is made,  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) section 163 (Rules of evidence and legal formality) is to be read as if it provided that new evidence may not be adduced before the Commission unless: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) notice of intention to do so, and of the substance of the new evidence, has been given in accordance with the regulations under this Act, or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (ii) the Commission gives leave. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         (2) The Commission may grant leave as referred to in subsection (1) (f) (ii) in such circumstances as it thinks fit and having regard to the nature of proceedings under section 181F, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Commission must grant leave in the following circumstances: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) where the Commission is satisfied that there is a real probability that the applicant may be able to show that the Commissioner has acted upon wrong or mistaken information, 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) where the Commission is satisfied that there is cogent evidence to suggest that the information before the Commissioner was unreliable, having been placed before the Commissioner maliciously, fraudulently, or vexatiously,  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) where the Commission is satisfied that the new evidence might materially have affected the Commissioner's decision.  
           
          
         
        
        
        
         
         181H Commissioner and members of Commissioner's Advisory Panels compellable witnesses only by leave 
         
        
        
         
         (1) In any proceedings before the Commissioner under this Division, neither the Commissioner nor any members of a Commissioner's Advisory Panel is compellable to give evidence in relation to the exercise of the Commissioner's functions under section 181D unless the Commission gives leave.  
         
        
        
         
         (2) The Commission may give such leave only if it considers that extraordinary grounds exist that warrant leave being given.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) In this section Commissioner's Advisory Panel 
           
         means a panel established by the Commissioner to assist in the exercise of the Commissioner's functions under section 181D. 
         
        
       
      
     6     
     I shall later set out some of the provisions of Part 6 of Chapter 2 of the IR Act. For present purposes it is noted that ss84, 85, 87, 88 and 89 of that Act are relevant to the present application.  
      
       
      
     The Application 
      
       
      
     7     
     The applicant filed an application in accordance with Form 10 of the Rules of the Commission. The form is applicable to an applicant bringing an action pursuant to s84 of the IR Act. 
      
       
      
     8     
     By his application, the applicant sought an order of reinstatement to the Police Service. The applicant further sought that, in the event that the Commission considers that ""it would not be probable that the applicant be reinstated"", then he would seek an amount of compensation. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The grounds relied upon by the applicant in the application were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The Commissioner of Police denied the Applicant procedural fairness before, during, and after the 181D proceedings. 
          
          
         2. The Commissioner of Police took into account irrelevant material when he determined to serve the 181D Notice on the Applicant and, when he determined to remove the Applicant from the Police Service. 
          
          
         3. The Commissioner of Police did not take into account material that he should have when he decided to remove the Applicant from the Police Service. 
          
          
         4. In the order removing the Applicant from the Police Service the Commissioner of Police relies on matter which were not referred to in the 181D Notice served on the Applicant. 
          
          
         5. There is no basis upon which the Commissioner of Police could conclude that the Applicant is not a person of conduct an[d] integrity and is a person not suitable to remain in the Police Service. 
          
          
         6. To the extent that it may be necessary the Applicant will seek leave to rely on other grounds to contend that his removal from the Police Service is unfair. 
         
        
       
      
     The Order 
      
       
      
     10     
     On 5 January 1999, the Commissioner made the order in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        Order under Section 181D(1) of the  
        Police Service Act 
         1990 
         
          
         I, Peter James Ryan, Commissioner of Police, having considered your conduct and integrity, do not have confidence in your suitability to continue as a police officer. By this order, I therefore remove you from the New South Wales Police Service.  
          
          
         In reaching my decision, I have considered a profile prepared in relation to you, the notice served upon you pursuant to Section 181D(3)(a), of the Act, and the written submissions furnished by you through your solicitors. I have carefully considered the matters raised by you in response to the notice.  
          
          
         The reasons for my decision are contained within the document annexed hereto and titled ""Commissioner's comments Re Section 181D Notices.""  
          
          
         Your removal from the New South Wales Police Service takes effect from the date of this order.  
         
        
       
      
     11     
     The order was served upon the applicant on 21 January 1999. 
      
       
      
     Reasons for the Decision 
      
       
      
     12     
     The reasons for decision (which were dated 23 November 1998) were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         I have read the profile and the response by Senior Constable Van Huisstede in relation [to] the matters and allegations raised against him.  
          
          
         It is regrettable that this incident has taken so long to resolve itself and come before the Commissioner for resolution. It should have been dealt with many months ago.  
          
          
         I note the denials by Van Huisstede regarding his conduct but this matter received incredible publicity at the time and created shock and horror in the community who could not believe the police were capable of the allegations which were made against them. This community concern still persists to this day.  
          
          
         I have carefully read the transcripts of the trial and the submission by Senior Constable Van Huisstede but find that I cannot sustain my confidence in this officer remaining a member of the NSW Police Service. The allegations, the subsequent community outrage and the damage to the reputation of the NSW Police Service is, to my mind, unforgivable. I tend to believe the allegations which were made rather than the account and denials made by the Senior Constable.  
          
          
         As I have recorded earlier, it is very regrettable that this matter has taken so long to finalise but nevertheless we should draw a line through this whole affair now. I find that I have no confidence in Van Huisstede remaining a member of the Police Service and therefore intend to issue the Notice under Section 181D of the  
         Police Service Act  
         1990.  
         
        
       
      
     The Profile and Notice issued pursuant to s181D(3)(a) 
      
       
      
     13     
     In the final paragraph of the reasons for decision of the Commissioner (""the decision""), the Commissioner indicated his intention to issue a notice pursuant to s181D. A notice was issued pursuant to s181D(3)(a) on 25 February 1998 (""the notice""). Hence the reference to the issuing of a notice in the decision is erroneous. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The notice was expressed in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
          
         Notice under Section 181D(3)(a) of the Police Service Act 1990 
          
          
         The Commissioner's Confidence provisions allows for the Commissioner of Police to remove an officer where he has lost confidence in the officer's suitability to remain a Police officer. This is determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the officer's conduct, integrity, performance or competence.  
          
          
         In accordance with Section 181D(3)(a) of the  
         Police Service Act  
         1990, I hereby give you notice that I do not have confidence in your suitability to continue as a police officer in regard to your  
         integrity and conduct 
          taking into account the following grounds: 
          
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     Your alleged inducement of two minors to participate in an act of child prostitution at Taree Police Station on 12 August 1990.  
      
       
        
         
          
         You are hereby notified that I am considering making an order for your removal from the New South Wales Police Service under Section 181D of the  
         Police Service Act 
          1990. In accordance with section 181D(3)(b) of the  
         Police Service Act 
          1990, prior to making my decision, you are hereby given 21 days from the date of the service of this notice, within which to make written submissions to me in relation to the proposed action.  
          
          
         Attached is a copy of your Service history and the facts relating to the matter. Your submission should be delivered to my Office, Level 18, Police Headquarters, 14-24 College Street, Darlinghurst 2010.

     ""The profile"" referred to in the decision was brought into existence as part of the process initiated by the Commissioner to consider whether or not to remove the applicant pursuant to s181D. These procedures will be discussed in greater detail later in this decision. The profile was forwarded to the Commissioner on 25 February 1998.

     Putting aside the cover page, the profile is a two page document. The first page of the profile provided the service history of the applicant. The second page of the profile was as follows:

     CIS 95004311. Following an anonymous complaint, allegedly made by a Police Officer, investigations were commenced into alleged sexual assault matters that had happened in Taree Police Station. As a result of these investigations, three girls, who had been in custody at Taree Police Station from 11 August 1990 to 13 August 1990, gave corroborating evidence that they performed oral sex on Senior Constable Van Huisstede and other officers in return for food.  
      
       
        
         
          
         Police Service Action 
          
          
         Senior Constable Van Huisstede was interviewed on 5 September 1995 in relation to the allegations. On 19 March, 1996 two issues were found sustained: 
          
         
        
       
      
     *  
     On 12 August 1990, at Taree, Senior Constable Van Huisstede did induce  
     Complainant 
       
     1 
      to participate in an act of child prostitution.  
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     *  
     On 12 August 1990, at Taree, Senior Constable Van Huisstede did induce  
     Complainant 
       
     II 
      in an act of child prostitution (with another officer).  
      
       
        
         
          
         It was recommended that departmental proceedings against Senior Constable Van Huisstede be postponed until after his criminal trial.  
          
          
         On 8 December 1997, Senior Constable Van Huisstede and another officer stood trial at Newcastle District Court, both indicted on two counts of ""Induce child to participate in an act of child prostitution"". On 18 December 1997, the jury found him not guilty of the two counts of which he was indicted. He was formally discharged by the Trial Judge.  
          
          
         POLICE OFFICER'S STATUS 
          
          
         Senior Constable Van Huisstede is still currently suspended without pay as a result of the above allegation.  
         
        
       
       
      
     17     
     In his decision, the Commissioner refers on a number of occasions to ""allegations"". In essence, his decision is based fundamentally upon an acceptance of ""allegations"", however described, made against the applicant. Another component of the Commissioner's reasoning process appears to be the ""community outrage"" arising from either the existence or publication of those allegations. 
      
       
      
     18     
     Section 181D(3)(a) requires the Commissioner to give a police officer a notice setting out the grounds on which the Commissioner does not have confidence in the officers suitability to continue as a police officer. The grounds specified in the notice were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Your alleged inducement of two minors to participate in an act of child prostitution at Taree Police Station on 12 August 1990 
         
        
       
      
     19     
     There was no reference in the decision to the grounds specified in the notice in the Commissioner's decision. As earlier mentioned the reference to the notice in the decision is plainly erroneous. It is presumably a reference to 'an order'. The notice is referred to in the order (issued later in time). In that instrument the Commissioner indicates that he has 'considered' the notice. 
      
       
      
     20     
     It is reasonably clear that the Commissioner had regard to matters not raised in the notice (or otherwise not brought to the attention of the police officer) in his decision. For example, the Commissioner had regard to matters such as ""community outrage"". I will refer to this issue later in the judgment. 
      
       
      
     21     
     It is not clear, just what the Commissioner was alluding to when he referred to ""allegations"" in his decision. In particular, it is not entirely clear whether, in considering allegations, the Commissioner confined his attentions to the grounds specified in the notice. 
      
       
      
     22     
     The Commissioner referred to the profile in his reasons for decision. That document does refer to ""allegations"", but those allegations are different in nature to the grounds specified in the notice and the findings of the investigating officer (which are also referred to in the profile). The allegations referred to in the profile were to the effect that the three girls had performed oral sex on the applicant and other officers. Both the notice and the findings of the investigating officer concern acts performed by two of the complainants. Further, the allegations in the profile do not make clear just how many officers were involved in the alleged activity. However, the notice and the finding of the investigating officer refer only to the acts of the applicant and one other police officer. 
      
       
      
     23     
     The investigating officer seems to have made findings inconsistent with the allegations identified in the profile as the profile records that the investigating officer found only two issues substantiated (which are detailed in the profile). No such distinction is found in the decision of the Commissioner. This lack of rigor or conciseness in the reasons for decision is undesirable. This is particularly so as provisions of s181D confine the Commissioner, in determining whether to make an order to remove a police officer, to a consideration of the grounds specified in the notice, unless the Commissioner provides the officer with the opportunity to make submissions in relation to any fresh notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) (assuming for present purposes that it is available to the Commissioner to issue a further notice). 
      
       
      
     24     
     The Commissioner must take the steps specified in s181D(3) before removing a police officer. The procedures required by that sub-section are mandatory. This is made clear by the opening words of the sub-section. This limitation also arises from the operation of s181D(3)(c). The requirement for the Commissioner to take into account the submission of a police officer with respect to any grounds specified in the notice would be rendered nugatory, if the Commissioner were permitted to have regard to grounds, in reaching a decision to remove an officer, which were not identified in the notice. 
      
       
      
     Cases presented by the Applicant and the Commissioner 
      
       
      
     25     
     Pursuant to s181F(1) of the Act, the Commission is required to firstly consider the Commissioner's reasons for decision and then the case presented by the applicant as to why the removal of the applicant was harsh, unreasonable or unjust and the Commissioner's reply to that case.  
      
       
      
     26     
     A Full Bench of the Commission in  
     Newton v New South Wales Police Service 
       
     (No.2)  
     (1999) 87 IR 66 at 75, 77 and 78 described the approach which should be adopted by the Commission in the exercise of its powers under s181F as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         While s181F requires the Commission, firstly, to consider the reasons provided by the Commissioner of Police for the decision to dismiss, it also requires the Commission to consider, secondly, the case presented by the applicant as to why the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust and, thirdly, the case presented by the Commissioner of Police in answer to the applicant's case. ... 
         
        
        
         
         Section 181F picks up those notions and, in reviewing a dismissal under s181D, imposes a statutory obligation on the Commission to consider the three matters specified in s181F(1) before finally determining the matter. In our view, it is an obligation which the Commission is not free to depart from in the way proposed by the appellant. ... 
         
        
        
         
         The passage emphasised confirms our consideration of s181F; that the role of the Commission is to conduct a review of the merits of the decision of the Commissioner of Police, to consider the whole of the circumstances of the matter in the way determined by s181F and apply the statutory criteria in that situation.  
         
        
       
      
     27     
     The reasons for decision given by the Commissioner have been earlier set out and discussed in a preliminary way. They shall be examined in greater detail later in this decision. Similarly, it is now appropriate to encapsulate the respective cases of the applicant and the Commissioner before proceeding to examine the evidence (in the context of the cases brought by the parties), the legislation and relevant principles and, finally, in the context of the requirements of s181F(1) of the Act, whether the decision to remove the applicant was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. 
      
       
      
     Case for the Applicant 
      
       
      
     28     
     Mr B.  
     Docking 
      of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that the applicant should be reinstated to his position with the Police Service as the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. The decision to remove the applicant may be so described as there had occurred ""procedural unfairness"" and ""substantive unfairness"" in the decision making process. 
      
       
      
     29     
     Broadly, as to the procedural considerations, the applicant submitted that:  
      
       
        
       1. The Commissioner made an uninformed decision due to his failure to consider relevant material. Central to this complaint was a contention that the Commissioner had failed to consider relevant evidence in the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant and, in particular, the corroborative evidence of Mr Wadsworth in favour of the applicant; 
        
        
       2. The Commissioner did not confine himself to rules of reason and justice. This issue principally concerned the Commissioner's reliance in his decision upon the publicity associated with the trial and community concerns over allegations made against the applicant;  
        
        
       3. The Commissioner failed to meet the statutory requirement, and in particular to meet the requirements of s181D(3)(c), by failing to take into consideration the written submission of the applicant. It was submitted that the Commissioner had not exercised his duty to take into consideration any written submissions because the duty had not been personally met by him but it had been undertaken by delegation; 
        
        
       4. The Commissioner, in considering the applicant's 'conduct and integrity', had found that he believed the allegations which were made. It was submitted that this was a process of finding proven allegations of criminal activity which was no more than a ""futile illusion of fairness""; 
        
        
       5. The Commissioner's reasons for decision were not adequate or proper due to their length, the use of a formula to cloak the decision with the appearance of conformity with the statute and a failure to indicate which material or evidence was rejected or accepted (or whether it was adequately based); 
        
        
       6. The Commissioner's delay of many months in applying the steps taken by him under s181D was, by his own admission, unfair. 
        
       
      
     30     
     As to the question of ""substantive unfairness"", the applicant submitted that: 
      
       
      
     1. On all the evidence, the Commissioner had not made out the charges on which the dismissal was based; 
      
       
      
     2. The applicant was not guilty of the misconduct upon which the Commissioner acted; 
      
       
      
     3. There was a harsh effect on the personal circumstances of the applicant as an individual in terms of his personal, social and economic situation. 
      
       
      
     31     
     The Commission will consider various aspects of these submissions in greater detail later in this decision.  
      
       
      
     The Case for the Respondent 
      
       
      
     32     
     Mr G.  
     Willis 
      of counsel, who appeared for the Commissioner, initially made submissions going to the nature of the legislative scheme. In this respect, he emphasised that the application before the Commission is for the review of an order made by the Commissioner to remove the applicant from the New South Wales Police Service. Mr  
     Willis  
     emphasised that the legislative scheme focussed upon the process of 'removal' of a police officer as opposed to the dismissal of an employee. 
      
       
      
     33     
     It was submitted that s181F casts a burden on the applicant of establishing that his removal from the Police Service was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. Furthermore s181F(3) required the Commission, in making its decision, to have regard to the interests of the applicant and the public interest. The public interest included the interest of maintaining the integrity of the Police Service and the fact that the Commissioner had made the order. Although the proceedings before the Commission were not disciplinary proceedings what had been said about the public interest in maintaining discipline in the Police Service is relevant to these proceedings: see  
     Hardcastle v Commissioner of Police 
      (1984) 53 ALR 593 at 597.  
      
       
      
     34     
     The need to maintain the reputation of the Police Service should particularly be taken into account in the public interest in these proceedings. The Commissioner also relied upon a decision of this Commission in  
     Bartlett v New South Wales Police Service 
      (1998) 87 IR 436 
     . 
      The legislation required, it was contended, the Commission to balance the competing interests. There is no basis in which the interests of the applicant should be given more importance or weight than that of the public. The fact that the Commissioner, by his order, has expressed a loss of confidence in the applicant's suitability to remain a police officer is significant in the public interest given his statutory responsibilities under the Act.  
      
       
      
     35     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      made detailed submissions as to the appropriateness of the process adopted by the Commissioner in reply to the submissions of the applicant concerning ""procedural fairness"". These detailed replies to the applicant's contentions will be considered later in this decision.  
      
       
      
     36     
     As to the applicant's submission that the Commissioner did not confine himself to rules of reason and justice, it was submitted that, although the decision was not clearly expressed, it was apparent the Commissioner had in mind the need to protect the reputation of the Police Service and maintain public confidence in it in stating his regard for the publicity and community concern. These are issues which went to the pubic interest and were clearly relevant to his decision. The Commissioner did not merely take into account that there were allegations involving the applicant. 
      
       
      
     37     
     As to the applicant's contention that the Commissioner had failed to properly take into consideration his submissions, Mr  
     Willis 
      submitted that there was no evidence that the Commissioner failed to take into account the written submissions. The only reasonable inference the Commission could draw from the evidence was that the Commissioner complied with his statutory obligation to consider the applicant's submission. 
      
       
      
     38     
     As to the applicant's submission that the process of finding proven allegations of criminal activity was no more than a 'futile illusion of fairness', it was submitted for the Commissioner that there was no requirement for either the analyst preparing a profile for the Commissioner or for the Commissioner himself to apply any standard of proof to the evidence relied upon. The Commissioner was entitled to remove an officer from the Police Service if, having regard to the officer's competence, integrity, performance or conduct, he did not have confidence in the officer's suitability to continue as a police officer. Amendments to the  
     Police Service Act 
      during the course of the Police Royal Commission and following the final report of the Royal Commission demonstrated that the legislature had intended to disentangle the Commissioner from complex and prolonged litigation concerning disciplinary matters arising from the conduct of police officers. The initial amended form of s181B demonstrated a clear legislative intention to give more freedom of action to the Commissioner whilst providing the officers concerned with a right of review. 
      
       
      
     39     
     It was submitted that s181D of the Act does not require the Commissioner to make a determination as to any particular state of affairs (that is, that a person is guilty of criminal behaviour or any other particular matter of fact). The section does not require the Commissioner to find as a proven fact that an officer is corrupt or incompetent, nor does it require the Commissioner to find as a matter of fact that certain conduct occurred. The section does not require the respondent to conduct an investigation or to conduct a hearing. The essence of the section is that the Commissioner should form a view that he does not have confidence in the officer's suitability based upon one or more of the four criteria referred to in s181D(1). 
      
       
      
     40     
     It was further submitted that the review available under s181E does not proceed on the basis that the Commissioner is required to prove criminality or the conduct referred to in the notice issued under s181D(3)(a), but rather proceeds on the basis that the onus is on the applicant to establish that his or her removal from the police service was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. That requirement is to have effect despite any law or practice to the contrary. 
      
       
      
     41     
     It was contended that in his reasons for decision, the Commissioner stated that he had carefully read the transcript of the trial and that he tended to believe the allegations rather than the account and denials made by the applicant. The Commissioner thereby concluded that he had no confidence in the applicant's suitability. In coming to that opinion, there was no requirement upon him to apply any standard of proof.  
      
       
      
     42     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      submitted that the reasons for decision were adequate and satisfied the statutory requirements. It was submitted that, whilst the reasons might have been more fully and clearly expressed, the significant and relevant matters were clear from the statement of reasons, namely, the Commissioner was concerned about the damage to the reputation of the Police Service ('the public interest'); and, on the basis the information contained in the profile, the transcript annexed to the applicant's written submissions and the submissions themselves, the Commissioner accepted the allegations made against the applicant (and rejected the applicant's denials). On the same material, the Commissioner formed the view that he had no confidence in the applicant's suitability to remain a police officer. Thus, the reasons given  
      
      
     were adequate. The Commission should not construe the reasons minutely or finely with an eye keenly attuned to the 'perception of error'.  
      
       
      
     43     
     As to the issue of delay, it was submitted that there was no evidence of any particular prejudice to the applicant of any delay by the Commissioner. The applicant was acquitted of the criminal charges on 18 December 1997 and the notice signed on 25 February 1998. The notice was served upon the applicant on 19 March 1998. The applicant's submission was then received and a process then followed under which reasons for decision were given on 20 November 1998 and an order signed on 5 January 1999.  
      
       
      
     44     
     In this case the incident occurred in 1990. However, the incident was not reported until 1995 through no fault of the Commissioner. The internal investigation that followed was reasonably prompt; the applicant being interviewed on 5 September 1995. The fact that criminal proceedings were not finally disposed of until December 1997 was no fault of the Commissioner. There was no unreasonable delay on the Commissioner's part and, if there was any such delay in completing the s181D process, it would not have added to any prejudice suffered by the applicant.  
      
       
      
     45     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      refuted the applicant's contention that there was ""substantive unfairness"". He referred to the decision in  
     Bigg v New South Wales Police Service (No. 2) 
      (1998) 80 IR 434 in relation to the shifting of the evidentiary burden of proving an allegation. It was submitted that, accepting for present purposes of argument that the profile which was originally forwarded to the Commissioner was deficient (in terms of the information it provided as to the allegations made against the applicant) at the time the Commissioner made his decision, he had been subsequently provided with sufficient information to allow him to properly exercise his discretion. The additional information as to the particulars of the allegations, the applicant's details, the inconsistencies in the complainants evidence and the applicant's evidence at his trial, were all provided by the applicant with his written submissions. The process required by the legislation in allowing the officer to make written submissions which must be taken into consideration by the Commissioner ensured a balance in the material upon which he made the decision. The evidence is that that process was adopted by the Commissioner in this case. Further, there is no evidentiary burden upon the Commissioner to prove the allegations. It was submitted that there was no onus upon the Commissioner in reinstatement proceedings before the Commission to establish that any corrupt or criminal conduct had, in fact, occurred.  
      
       
      
     46     
     It was also submitted that this is not a case where the Commissioner was exercising a contractual right of summary dismissal, nor is it a case where he was exercising a statutory right of dismissal. The legislative scheme provided that s181D was not for the dismissal of police officers on the ground of conduct (or any other criteria). The scheme conferred a discretionary power upon the Commissioner to remove police officers in whom he no longer had confidence. Like the statutory scheme considered in  
     Bigg (No. 2),  
     s181D is a specific statutory scheme not previously considered in cases before the Commission. The legislature had recognised a distinction between dismissal and removal. Section 181D provides that the removal of a police officer under the section had the same effect as if the officer had resigned or retired. This was clearly meant to ameliorate the effect of removal, both in terms of preserving accrued benefits and in terms of any stigma that might otherwise attach to being dismissed.  
      
       
      
     47     
     The legislature had intended to remove the previous system of dealing with disciplinary complaints against police officers. If in these proceedings the respondent is required to prove the conduct in issue then the old system will not have changed. There are no departmental charges, but essentially, the Commissioner will bear the same onus (to prove the particularised misconduct) which existed under the scheme described by the Minister in his second reading speech where he described the legislation as being cumbersome, somewhat protracted and legalistic. 
      
       
      
     48     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      also contended that the fact that the applicant was acquitted of criminal charges did not mean that the Commissioner was not entitled to form the opinion that he had lost confidence in the applicant's suitability to remain a police officer. 
      
       
      
     49     
     Finally, it was submitted that it was not every failure to follow procedure that would warrant the intervention of the Commission. The Commission should take into account that the allegations made against the applicant were of a most serious kind and that although the three complainants were inconsistent in their accounts in evidence, they were consistent in the sense that they each gave an account of an incident of the same type. Each complainant had identified that the incident had occurred in the cells of the Taree police station. Even though the magistrate at the committal had reluctantly committed the applicant for trial, it may be inferred from the evidence that the Director of Public Prosecutions considered that there was sufficient evidence to find an indictment against him and require him to stand trial. Further, although the District Court issued a cost certificate in favour of the applicant, the trial had not been taken away from the jury and there was no directed verdict in favour of the applicant. The Commission was, therefore, entitled to draw the inference that the District Court was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury. It was true  
      
      
     that the applicant had been acquitted of criminal charges but the disciplinary investigation conducted by the investigator found, on 19 March 1996, the two issues sustained.  
      
       
      
     Background to the Initiation of Procedures under s181D  
      
       
      
     50     
     The applicant is a 32 year old former police officer who held the rank of Senior Constable at the time of his removal from the Police Service. He became a trainee at the Goulburn Police Academy in 1987 and commenced duties as a probationary Constable in Taree in January 1988. He became a Constable in January 1989. He remained stationed at Taree, carrying out general and other duties until July 1994 at which time he was transferred to Mudgee where he obtained a promotion to the rank of Senior Constable. He was removed from service whilst stationed at Mudgee.  
      
       
      
     51     
     At the time of the incident giving rise to the allegations made against the applicant, namely 12 August 1990, the applicant was residing in Forster and stationed at the Taree police station. He was not interviewed in relation to the allegations until after he left the Taree police station.  
      
       
      
     52     
     On 5 September 1995, the applicant was interviewed by officers from the internal affairs unit, Northern Region. The investigation was carried out as part of a disciplinary process. Some five months later the investigator made a finding that two charges (referred to in the profile) were sustained against the applicant. The first of those charges involved an allegation that the applicant induced a female person to engage in sexual acts upon him. The second charge concerned the applicant inducing a complainant to perform such acts with another police officer.  
      
       
      
     53     
     It is appropriate at this juncture to refer to the decision made by the Commission during the proceedings as to the non-publication of the identity of the persons who made the allegations against the applicant. The Commission made various non-publication and 'pseudonym orders' such that the complainants would be referred to in the proceedings as KB1, KB2 AND RS (""the complainants"").  
      
       
      
     54     
     The reasons for that decision were given on 9 November 1999 as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Having regard to the decision of the Commission in  
         Ann Margaret Stonham v The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales 
          in matter number IRC649 of 1999 published on 9 August 1999, I have decided, noting the consent of the parties to this course to continue the orders made yesterday as to the non-publication of the identity of the three persons who have been the subject of evidence in these proceedings, who have been designated for the purposes of the making of these pseudonym orders respectively the names or code names KB1, KB2, and, RS.  
          
          
         In coming to that decision I should emphasise that the proceedings before the Commission, both in relation to section 84 of the Act and generally, are proceedings which should occur in public, and that a proceeding would only occur on a private or restricted basis where it is proven necessary for that step to be taken. I have in mind in particular the adoption by the Full Bench of the decision of Justice  
         Schmidt  
         in  
         X v The New South Wales Department of Education 
         , which is provided in the judgment in  
         Stonham 
          at pages 27 to 29 in that regard.  
          
          
         In this case I have taken into account the consent of the parties as one matter going to the exercise of my discretion to so confine the proceedings. There are two other considerations which in my view require the making of non-publication orders. I note before giving those reasons that in the case  
         of X v The New South Wales Department of Education 
           
         and Training 
          her Honour Justice  
         Schmidt 
          made such an order with respect to the student in that case. In the present matter I consider that the orders should be made additionally, firstly as suppression orders of this kind or character were made in the criminal proceedings before the District Court of New South Wales and, secondly, having regard to the fact that the three persons in question will be not called to give evidence in these proceedings, thereby effectively making them third parties to the proceedings and not having the opportunity to be heard in relation to this question or to be considered specifically in the context of the evidence that they may give in the proceedings. For those reasons I make the non-publication orders referred to yesterday.  
         
        
       
      
     55     
     The reference to complainant one in the profile is a reference to ""KB2"". It has been alleged since 5 September 1995 that KB2 performed oral sex upon the applicant on 12 August 1990. At that time KB2 was fifteen years of age.  
      
       
      
     56     
     It has not been alleged that either KB1 or RS performed oral sex on the applicant. It was suggested that RS performed oral sex on another officer, namely Mr Riley, who has since deceased. RS was seventeen years of age on 12 August 1990. The third officer alleged to have been at the police station on 12 August 1990 was David Bryce Wadsworth (who at the time held the rank of Senior Constable). It was not suggested that KB1 had oral sex with Mr Wadsworth or, for that matter, the applicant or Mr Riley.  
      
       
      
     57     
     On or about 9 November 1995 the applicant was charged with two counts of inducing a child to participate in child prostitution. The offences were laid under s91D(1)(a) of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1900 
     .  
      
       
      
     58     
     Section 91D(1)(a) of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1900 was relevantly in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) Any person who - 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) by any means causes or induces a child to participate in an act of child prostitution; ... 
            
            
           is liable to penal servitude for 10 years or if the child is under the age of 14 years, to penal servitude of 14 years.  
            
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     59     
     The applicant was committed for trial on 16 April 1996. In his submission to the Commissioner, the applicant called in aid of the findings of the magistrate in determining to commit him for trial. I shall set out below some of the salient aspects of the magistrate's findings: 
      
       
        
         
         These proceedings are anachronistic in another sense, in the fact that the material upon which the prosecution relies, upon [sic] recollection of documentary evidence going back to 1990, justice delayed is justice denied. The reason for that is more than anything else is the failure of recollection after such a long period of time. One of the complainants in these proceedings was, as I understand it, fifteen years old at the time that these events took place or were alleged to have taken place. One can speculate on the propriety or otherwise of the decision to prosecute in these circumstances because the matters that Mr Scragg and Mr Meadley have drawn to attention manifestly demonstrate the difficulties which the prosecution confronts.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The allegations which have been made against these two defendants are serious. They are particularly serious because they were, at the time, responsible for the custody of three young girls who had been arrested while in a stolen motor vehicle. They were not arrested by these defendants but by other police. The defendants responsibilities on the evidence were simply as custodial officers. The evidence that has been presented to the court in these committal proceedings suggests serious improprieties by [the] defendants towards these young persons and it suggests that they have taken advantage of these young women by seeking sexual favours in return for food. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         The evidence against Mr Wadsworth does not for one minute suggest that he was directly involved in taking any sexual advantage, the evidence suggests only that he was there and aware of what was alleged to have gone on and that he was ultimately responsible for bringing the food, which [was], according to the prosecution, the inducement to the three young women in the cell. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Now, it is fundamental that the case against each defendant stands or falls initially on the credibility of the three young female complainants. The records and other information before the court suggests these three were far from model members of the Taree community. The inconsistencies in their evidence is manifest. There is certainly no clear indication about what time these events were said to have taken place. The insistence by the witness KB2 that she was arrested on the Friday could hardly be seen, however, as an indication of her lacking credibility. Her insistence seems to me to have been more than anything else a complete failure of memory, remembering again that she was fifteen years old at the time that these events were said to have taken place. How good would anybody expect the recollections of a fifteen year old to be after she had gone through the experience of being locked up even over one night in the Taree cells.  
          
          
         Ms Wells is quite correct in her observation that if these three were fabricating a story, one would expect a story far more precise and consistent in it's detail of what is alleged to have taken place. It is all too frequently the case in criminal proceedings the defendants seek to find differences between the evidence, the police giving evidence for the prosecution or other prosecution witnesses, it leads t[o] some odd results, particularly presentation of police evidence. The fact is, experience in the courts show that inconsistency in some respects tends to enhance credibility simply for the reason that if a story is to be concocted then it will be obvious that certain elements of the story are exactly the same. These three young women, in their evidence, did not come close to achieving precisely the same accounts. Certainly, KB2, the last of the three young women to give evidence was a very poor witness. Even now she appears to me to be a person of considerable immaturity and it is very difficult to determine the degree of her distress in the witness box was anything other than a reflection of that immaturity confronted with the extremely difficult situation of having to give evidence of a graphic and unpleasant kind in proceedings like this.  
          
          
         As I've said it's clear from the material that there are grave inconsistencies in the accounts given by the three young girls. As I've also said, I think the prosecution has a difficult task with this matter, the events occurring some six years ago, but what I cannot get past at the moment is that fundamentally the evidence of the three women is of the same kind as to the events which are said to have taken place in the Taree cells on or about 12 August 1990. It is, in my view, a matter of the credibility of the three balanced against whatever the defence can make from the inconsistencies in their accounts, but I don't believe that at this stage the law allows me to form a conclusion a jury properly instructed would not be likely to convict the defendants. I could not put it that high and while I have my doubts about the desirability of the matter going beyond this stage, that is a matter for public policy I suppose, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, but I am not able to reach the positive conclusion required of me under S41(6) were I to be of a mind to discharge these defendants and because I can't reach that conclusion I will commit them for trial. 
         
        
       
       
      
     60     
     The applicant was subsequently suspended from duty without pay and stood trial on 8 December 1997. Judge GHT  
     Armitage 
      QC of the District Court of New South Wales presided over the trial. Senior Constable David Wadsworth was a co-defendant at that trial.  
      
       
      
     61     
     During the course of the trial Judge  
     Armitage  
     directed the jury to acquit Senior Constable Wadsworth. On 18 December 1997 the applicant was acquitted by the jury on the two counts charged.  
      
       
      
     62     
     On 29 July 1998 Judge  
     Armitage  
     issued a certificate under the  
     Costs in Criminal Cases Act  
     1967. The applicant pointed to this certificate as significantly in his favour given the opinion that was required to be formed by the District Court in order for the certificate to be issued. The relevant aspect of the opinion formed by the District Court in relation to the prosecution was as follows: 
      
       
      
     (a) If the prosecution had, before the proceedings against the said [the applicant] were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute proceedings and; 
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     (b) That any act or omission of the said [the applicant] that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.  
      
       
      
     63     
     The profile and the notice were prepared prior to the issuing of this certificate, but after the acquittal of the applicant.  
      
      
     Procedure Adopted by the Commissioner 
      
     General 
      
       
      
     64     
     Broadly speaking, the procedure adopted by the Commissioner consisted of: 
      
       
      
     1. A police officer was identified as a person who may warrant action being taken pursuant to s181D of the Act; 
      
       
         
       
      
     2. A procedure was then adopted to assist the Commissioner in determining whether or not to issue a notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) of the Act. This involved a person entitled an 'analyst' preparing a profile which was then provided to the Commissioner (after some scrutiny, in this case, by Detective Inspector Champion). A recommendation may accompany the profile. The Commissioner played no role in the preparation of the profile and, at least in this matter, did not generally receive the materials relied upon by the analyst; 
      
       
         
       
      
     3. A notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) or alternatively a performance warning notice may then issued (as earlier noted in this case a s181D(3)(a) notice was issued); 
      
       
         
       
      
     4. If, as in this case, a notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) of the Act was issued then the police officer was given 21 days to respond; 
      
       
         
       
      
     5. Upon receipt of the officer's submission, an analyst prepared a response which, together with the profile and submissions, were provided to the Commissioner for the purposes of considering whether to issue an order. A recommendation may accompany the materials forwarded to the Commissioner; 
      
       
         
       
      
     6. In this matter the Commissioner reached a decision, gave reasons for same in writing and then made an order pursuant to s181D which is served on the police officer. 
      
       
      
     The Profile 
      
       
      
     65     
     Detective Inspector Allen Maurice Champion, who was attached to the police internal affairs unit, was provided the applicant's name as ""a candidate for Commissioner's confidence action"". He then assigned the task of preparing the profile to a member of the internal affairs staff. He gave instructions to prepare a summary of the applicant's service history, a summary of facts involved in the charges that had been proffered against the officer and the action taken by the Police Service.  
      
       
      
     66     
     A written procedure has been introduced by the Commissioner to deal with processes concerning s181D of the Act. That procedure is contained within a document entitled ""Commissioner's Confidence Process: Section 181D of the  
     Police Service Act  
     1990"". This is the standard operating procedure for handling such matters. The standard operating procedure provides for the nomination of a police officer who may warrant consideration under the provisions of s181D. An initial assessment is then made within the Police Service as to whether the matter should be progressed. This is undertaken by a review team. If the review team decides to progress the nomination of a police officer a profile, a notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) and a performance warning notice is prepared.  
      
       
      
     67     
     The operating procedure established the following standards for the development of the profile:  
      
       
        
         
         4.1 A Profile is a critically and clinically researched document that details the: 
          
         Officer's service history; 
          
         Criteria under which they are being considered (for example, conduct and integrity); 
          
         Facts relating to the contemporary issue and linked sustained matters being considered including Police Service action(s); 
          
         Officer's current employment status ... 
         
        
       
      
     68     
     At the time of the preparation of the profile concerning the applicant there was not a record kept of the process of critically and clinically researching the matter. The methodology was changed in or about early 1998 after the assessment of his matter.  
      
       
      
     69     
     The standard operating procedure does not lay down any specific criteria as to the assessment of factual issues. The profile is prepared by analysts. These persons consist of a mixture of both administrative and sworn police officers, some of which had not been trained in any investigative work. They examine the material provided to them to prepare the profile. They are required to consider  
     bona fides 
      of the material supplied and to weigh up competing evidence, including the consideration of corroborative and scientific evidence. Where there are conflicts between versions of events the analysts are instructed to ""resolve the issue as best they can"". However, in this case Detective Inspector Champion conducted a final review of the profile before it was sent to the Commissioner. He examined whether the material was of an appropriate standard to progress to the Commissioner and whether it was in a suitable style having regard also to grammatical and typographical accuracy.  
      
       
      
     70     
     The analyst preparing the profile in relation to the applicant received material contained in what is described as a complaints file. exhibit T in the proceedings contained in paginated pages four to thirty two, some of the material contained within the complaints file. An objection was made to the admissibility of exhibit T. For the purposes of the analysis of the procedures which I am presently undertaking, I have determined to admit into evidence exhibit T. It is relevant to ascertaining those materials which were before the Commissioner or the analyst engaged in the s181D(3)(a) process. I shall return to the question as to whether these documents should be admitted as to the truth of any allegations contained within them later in this judgment.  
      
       
      
     71     
     It is clear from exhibit T that the analyst had received a bundle of documents which consisted of guide sheets setting out certain offences which were alleged to have been committed by the applicant together with a summary of facts. There was also contained within the documents statements by KB1, KB2 and RS. These statements were used in the criminal prosecution of the applicant. However, the analyst was not provided with the transcript of any part of the criminal proceedings. Nor was the analyst provided with the transcript of the committal hearing or the proceedings before Judge  
     Armitage 
      of the District Court of NSW. The trial transcripts were obtained at a later time, after the decision to remove the applicant was made. On the evidence of Detective Inspector Champion, there was no reason why the trial transcripts could not have been obtained at an earlier time. The analyst did not prepare any documents setting out any inconsistencies existing between the versions of the complainants.  
      
       
      
     The Notice 
      
       
      
     72     
     A document was forwarded to the Commissioner titled ""Commissioner's Checklist"". This document verified that the Commissioner had regard only to the profile in deciding to issue the notice. It also indicated that the Commissioner had regard to the grounds set out in a draft notice (which ultimately become the grounds contained within the earlier notice set out in this judgment).  
      
       
      
     73     
     A memorandum from Detective Inspector Champion was forwarded with the checklist. The Detective Inspector recommended that the Commissioner consider issuing either a ""181D Notice"" or, in the alternative, a ""Performance Warning Notice"".  
      
       
      
     74     
     The only information the Commissioner received, for the purposes of determining whether or not he should issue a notice pursuant to s181D(3)(a) of the Act, was the profile which was prepared in the foregoing manner. The Commissioner was not, therefore, advised of the evidence given by the complainants at the committal or the trial, including whether there existed inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainants given at the trial. He was not advised of any observations made by the magistrate at the committal hearing. He was not advised as to whether the co-defendant, Mr Wadsworth, had been acquitted by direction or had given corroborating evidence in favour of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     Submission by the Applicant 
      
       
      
     75     
     The applicant made a response to the notice. This response consisted of a submission together with some attachments. The primary elements of the submission were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) The applicant emphatically rejected the allegation that he had in any way acted improperly at the Taree Police Station on 12 August 1990.  
          
          
         (b) He was found not guilty of two criminal charges. 
          
          
         (c) The investigation into the allegations took place some five years after the date in which they were alleged to have occurred. 
          
          
         (d) Prior to the investigation the applicant had some knowledge of the allegations because of the suicide of Mr Riley. 
          
          
         (e) The statements made by the applicant in a record of interview conducted on 5 September 1995 were true. 
          
          
         (f) During the trial the applicant was vigorously cross-examined and it may be implied that the jury found him a witness of credit. 
          
          
         (g) During his police service there were no adverse findings of a disciplinary nature made against him. The applicant had no criminal record. 
         
        
       
      
     76     
     The applicant attached to his submission a number of documents consisting of the following: 
      
       
        
       (a) Record of interview between Detective Inspector Shepherd and the applicant at Mudgee Police Station held on 5 September 1995. 
        
        
       (b) The findings of the magistrate at the committal proceedings.  
        
        
       (c) A transcript of the applicant's evidence in the District Court trial. 
        
       
      
     Response to Applicant's Submission 
      
       
      
     77     
     Following the receipt of the applicant's response a member of the Internal Affairs staff prepared a response to the applicant's submission.  
      
       
      
     78     
     The document was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         Senior Constable Van Huisstede has provided a response in relation to the issues identified on the Notice served upon him on 19 March 1998, with the assistance of his solicitor, Mr Ken Madden. He states that his response is prepared on the basis of an assurance given to his solicitor that the Police Service has complied with s181E(3) of the  
         Police Service Act 
         .  
         
        
        
         
         Section 181E(3) states that ""it is the duty [of the] Commissioner to make available all of the documents and other material on which the Commissioner has relied in deciding that the Commissioner does not have confidence in the applicant's suitability to continue as a police officer, as referred to in s181D(1)."" It should be noted that this particular section of the Act relates to the review of the s.181D Order, applied by the Industrial Relations Commission, on the grounds that the officer's removal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust.  
         
        
        
         
         The issue identified on the Notice revolves around the allegation that Senior Constable Van Huisstede was involved in the inducement of two minors to participate in an act of child prostitution.  
         
        
        
         
         As a result of the receipt of the Officer's response, the response and the facts contained within the profile were reviewed. No deficits pertaining to the facts contained within the Profile were identified.  
         
        
        
         
         The information contained within the Profile, the Officer's response and its attachments, should be relied upon in determining this issue.  
         
        
       
      
     79     
     The reference to deficits in the second last paragraph of this document was explained by Detective Inspector Champion in his evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Is that a term commonly used in the section 181D process about there being deficits? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, it is not something that is commonly in use. It was used by the analyst who conducted the review.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember in examination in chief you were the one who actually the one who used exactly the same expression before you were asked expressly about page 8 of Exhibit A?  
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I read it off the actual page.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it an expression that is commonly used or not?  
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You do not really know what the analyst meant to convey by the note, deficits pertaining to the facts within the profile were identified as set out on page 8 of Exhibit A?  
         
        
        
         
         A. My interpretation is that that is the purpose of the analysis, is to establish the applicant in his response has provided evidence that negates any primary issue in the material, which originally went to the Commissioner and formed the ground on which he is facing his determination or if there is something identified - that would be what we are talking about here.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. You said your interpretation. Have you seen that expression used before in s181D process analysis of responses?  
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I have.  
         
        
        
         
         Q. In giving your interpretation, do you actually know in what way the analyst used it on page 8 of Exhibit A?  
         
        
        
         
         A. Do I know? No, I don't know. I take it that was the use of that particular phrase.

     Prior to this document being forwarded to the Commissioner an advice was obtained from a solicitor engaged by the Police Service.  
      
       
      
     Order Making Process 
      
       
      
     81     
     Detective Inspector Champion forwarded a memorandum to the Commissioner dated 30 September 1998. This document was accompanied by a checklist in the following terms: 
      
       
      
      
      COMMISSIONER'S CHECKLIST 
      
      
       
        
         
         RE 
         : Senior Constable Ian John VAN HUISSTEDE 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         In accordance with Section 181D of the  
         Police Service Act 
         , 1990 in making my decision to issue an Order I have relied upon the following material; 
         
        
        
       
      
     *  
     PROFILE 
      
     *  
     NOTICE 
      
     *  
     OFFICER'S RESPONSE 
      
     *  
     ANALYSIS OF THE RESPONSE 
      
       
        
         
         COMMENTS: 
         
        
        
         
         I have considered the grounds set out in the Notice and have not taken into account the following: 
         
        
        
         
         [No entry appeared in this section] 
         
        
        
         
         The reasons for my decision to issue an Order are as follows: 
         
        
        
         
         Please see attached.  
         
        
       
      
     82     
     The memorandum contained the following comments: 
      
       
        
         
         Senior Constable Van Huisstede, with the assistance of Walter Madden and Jenkins solicitors, has furnished a written response which is attached.  
          
          
         The profile, of the officer's response, together with an analysis of the response are provided to the Commissioner who should now consider that material and provide advice as to whether he determines to remove the officer and issue an Order, or considers a Performance Warning Notice appropriate.  
          
          
         The Commissioner should endorse on the attached checklist that he has considered the material and make comment as to the reasons he is relying upon for removal and grounds that he has not taken into consideration. The appropriate document will be provided to the Commissioner for signature upon his determination.  
         
        
       
      
     83     
     Thus, the Commissioner had before him for the purposes of determining whether to remove the applicant the profile, the notice, the applicant's submission and the analysis. There was no other material before the Commissioner.  
      
       
      
     84     
     The Commissioner did not receive a draft of the reasons for decision. This was prepared by the Commissioner himself.  
      
       
      
     Materials Received by the Applicant 
      
       
      
     85     
     During the course of the aforementioned process the applicant received from the Commissioner the profile, the notice, the Commissioner's reasons for decision and the Order. He did not receive a copy of the materials which were examined by the analyst in preparing the profile. Furthermore, he did not receive any materials concerning public or community reaction to the allegations made against him. Nor was he advised that the Commissioner would take into account these considerations in his Reasons for Decision.  
      
       
      
     Information and materials not considered by the Police Commissioner 
      
       
      
     86     
     Mr  
     Docking 
      submitted that the Commissioner's decision was uninformed because he did not have regard to the following: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) The New South Wales Police Service brief of evidence, the committal depositions or the District Court trial transcripts.  
          
          
         (2) The inconsistencies in the various versions of the three female persons.  
          
          
         (3) Dishonesty of the three female persons.  
          
          
         (4) The nature of the evidence of the three female persons as found by Judge  
         Armitage 
          in his decision to issue a cost certificate.  
          
          
         (5) The corroboration of Mr Wadsworth for the applicant's account and denials.  
         
        
       
      
     87     
     I shall now turn to the respective submissions of the parties as to these contentions and my findings of fact in relation to same.  
      
       
      
     Brief of evidence, committal dispositions and trial transcripts  
      
       
      
     88     
     It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Commissioner did not consider the brief of evidence of the criminal proceedings, the criminal depositions or the District Court trial transcripts even though these documents were available to him. Mr  
     Willis  
     submitted that the analyst who prepared the profile did receive the brief of evidence although these documents were not considered by the Commissioner. The respondent conceded that the committal depositions and the District Court trial transcripts were not considered by either the analyst or himself. The only record of the criminal proceedings considered by the Commissioner was the transcript of evidence of the applicant at the District Court trial, which transcript came to the Commissioner's attention as an annexure to the applicant's submission. The analyst apparently considered the brief evidence which contained the statements by the complainants. However, the profile does not provide any description of this material except perhaps by the making of the statement contained under the heading ""Facts"" appearing in the profile as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         Gave corroborating evidence that they performed oral sex on Senior Constable Van Huisstede and other officers in return for the food.  
         
        
       
      
     89     
     So expressed, the description is not consistent with any of the allegations made against any of the police officers as at no time was it suggested that the three girls performed oral sex on the police officers. The profile does not record any statement by the applicant as to his account of the allegations except to note that he was found not guilty of the criminal charges.  
      
       
      
     90     
     In my view, the committal transcripts and the District Court transcripts could have been obtained for the purposes of the Commissioner considering whether to remove the police officer pursuant to s181D of the Act. Detective Inspector Champion indicated in his evidence that the material had not been obtained because it was simply not the practise to do so.  
      
       
      
     Inconsistencies in the Various Versions of the Complainants 
      
       
      
     91     
     It was submitted for the applicant that inconsistencies in the versions of the three female persons were not considered by the Commissioner although the applicant had pointed to the Local Court's criticisms of the complainants (and this information was before the Commissioner). In reply, Mr  
     Willis 
      submitted that the Commissioner did have knowledge of the inconsistencies in the various versions of the three complainants because the applicant had included the decision of the Local Court Magistrate at the committal proceedings with his submission to the Commissioner. 
      
       
      
     92     
     At no stage did the Commissioner consider directly the evidence of the three persons. He could not therefore have directly considered whether and to what extent there existed inconsistencies in the accounts of their complaints. Nor did the Commissioner have the benefit of any commentary by an analyst or Detective Inspector Champion as to the existence or otherwise of any such inconsistencies. 
      
       
      
     93     
     Detective Inspector Champion's evidence as to the provision of information to the Commissioner concerning inconsistencies in the versions of events by the complainants to the Commissioner is instructive.  
      
       
      
     94     
     Detective Inspector Champion stated in cross-examination that the reference in the profile to a finding of ""not guilty"" at the trial was an adequate way of raising any conflict in the evidence concerning the applicant. However, he also conceded that commonsense and good police practice in an ordinary criminal investigation would be to analyse conflicts by drawing up a table comparing the competing versions. Similarly, it would be commonsense and good police practice for information of that type to be provided to the Commissioner to assess whether to issue a notice under s181D of the Act.  
      
       
      
     95     
     The Detective Inspector indicated that the Commissioner had no information before him as would permit him to make comparisons or to conduct an analysis as to competing versions of events regarding the allegations against the applicant, although he had the observations of the magistrate before him. The Commissioner had called for such information in other cases arising under s181D of the Act but had decided not to make such a request in this matter. 
      
       
      
     96     
     The Commissioner did not seek or obtain information as to the accounts given by the complainants after the receipt of the Local Court's observations at the committal trial (accompanying the applicants submission), even though, as the Detective Inspector recognised, the observations made by the Local Court magistrate were a cause for concern as to the veracity of the allegations made. Detective Inspector Champion considered that the magistrate’s warning indicated a need for general concern and that in order to draw more specific conclusions as to the Local Court's observations it would be necessary to know, for example, in the case of the evidence of KB2, ""why the magistrate thought the witness to be a very poor witness"".  
      
       
      
     97     
     This would indicate, in my view, a recognition by the witness of a need for a more detailed examination of the background of the Local Court's observations in order to reasonably reach conclusions as to allegations made against the applicant by the complainants. 
      
       
      
     98     
     Detective Inspector Champion resisted the suggestion that commonsense and good police practice had not been administered in the process applied in deciding whether to remove the applicant pursuant to s181D. He also resisted the proposition that the Commissioner had not applied the Police Service's own standard in any such determination. However, he did make a number of concessions as to deficiencies in the information which the Commissioner relied upon in reaching his decision to remove the applicant from service as a police officer.  
      
       
      
     99     
     He gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. We know from your evidence already that the Commissioner failed to take into account the circumstances of the case, that there were inconsistencies, didn't he? 
          
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. So according to your own standard, and when I say yours I mean the police service's standard, the Commissioner fails, doesn't he? 
          
          
         A. Just referring to the previous question, you said the Commissioner failed to take into account their are inconsistencies. I refer to my answer previously. The Commissioner was advised that the officer was tested at the trial. There is no reference there to an analysis of inconsistencies between the evidence of the witnesses. Yes, I would agree with that.  
          
          
         Q. Well, in terms of what you have accepted for both investigating criminal offences and the s181D process is commonsense and good police practice, you have accepted that never happened for Mr Van Huisstede, to your knowledge, concerning the inconsistencies?  
          
          
         A. That the inconsistencies--are you saying that the inconsistencies were never considered? That was the question, was it? 
          
          
         Q. That is what I am getting at and according to your evidence Commissioner Ryan never considered the inconsistencies that you have accepted is good police practise and commonsense? 
          
          
         A. Yes, I accept that.  
          
          
         Q. When you say you accept the Commissioner, in effect, failed his own standard, that is right, isn't it, because he did not take into account all the circumstances involving Mr Van Huisstede? 
          
          
         A. The Commissioner did not, as you said, refer to a table of inconsistencies.  
          
          
         Q. Using your own words, and I mean the police, the Commissioner did not take into account all circumstances of the inconsistencies in the case involving Mr Van Huisstede, did he? 
          
          
         A. All of the circumstances, yes, I would agree with that, all of them.  
          
          
         Q. And it follows, using the police service's own standard, that the Commissioner for Mr Van Huisstede was not extremely careful and diligent [sic] in regard to any determination in the s181D process for Mr Van Huisstede? 
          
          
         A. No, I would not agree with that ...  
         
        
       
      
     100     
     Further, the Detective Inspector gave the following evidence:  
      
       
        
         
         Q. Look at the allegations made against Mr Van Huisstede. Would you in your ordinary experience as an investigator or section 181D officer, accept grave inconsistencies in the accounts given by the three young girls, must be deficits pertaining to the allegations?  
          
          
         A. Yes, I would say yes.  
          
          
         Q. There is no other way one could characterise it for the allegations of Mr Van Huisstede other than it being a deficit pertaining to the facts? 
          
          
         A. The facts in general? No. I do not consider it is a deficit in relation to the material set out in the paginated document 59.  
          
          
         Q. Do you consider it a surplage 
           
         to the allegations about Mr Van Huisstede? 
          
          
         A. A surplage? Could you give me another view.  
          
          
         Q. A necessary fact for the Commissioner to consider, that the Magistrate had expressed the view there were grave inconsistencies? 
          
          
         A. No, it wasn't necessary, and based on that the Commissioner was advised that ultimately at the end of the criminal prosecution, that the applicant was discharged and found not guilty.  
          
          
         Q. But the Commissioner was missing all the building blocks, was he not, between the committal and the discharge, for example the inconsistencies in the evidence of the girls? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. And that is an essential building block, if someone is to express an opinion, is it not, for those sorts of most serious allegations? 
          
          
         A. Yes, you could view it as that.  
          
          
         Q. There is no other way to view, is there, for the purpose of considering these types of allegations?  
          
          
         A. I think it has certainly some relevance to it but I think it is far more relevant on this basis, that the Commissioner was advised of the outcome of the trial, rather than what occurred on the way through.  
          
          
         Q. But in your experiences, when someone is looking at the outcome of a trial, an ordinary commonsense approach is to look at why that outcome occurred? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. One issue someone would look at concerning the outcome of the trial was whether there was any deficits in the evidence of the Crown? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. In other words the deficit could be inconsistencies in the evidence of the accusers? 
         
        
       A. Yes 
        
         
         Q. Another deficit would be whether the accusers were acceptable as credible witnesses? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. The opposite to a deficit, from at least a Crown point of view, would be whether the accused, being Mr Van Huisstede, was acceptable as a credible witness? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. It would be on the cards that he must have been accepted by the jury of twelve as a credible witness, to be acquitted? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
         
        
       
      
     Dishonesty of Three Female Persons (the Complainants) 
      
       
      
     101     
     It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Commissioner was not entitled to ignore material of which he had actual or constructive knowledge, namely the dishonesty of the three female persons. It was submitted that this information had a direct bearing on the justice of the decision made. In reply, Mr  
     Willis  
     submitted that whilst particulars or respective records of the complainants was not available to the Commissioner, it was clear from the material that he had before him that they were not of unblemished character. In this respect, it was submitted that it was central to the allegations that the three complainants were being held in custody at the Taree Police Station at the relevant time. Furthermore, it was submitted that the decision of the magistrate referred to the complainants being arrested while in a stolen motor vehicle and that the records and information before the court suggested that the complainants were far from model members of the Taree community.  
      
       
      
     102     
     It is clear that actual records of the criminal history of the complainants was not taken into account in the process leading to the making of the s181D order. This material was readily available to the Police Service.  
      
       
      
     103     
     KB2 had a history of convictions in the Children's Court, which are referred to in the criminal records produced by the Police Service in these proceedings as including ""break, enter and steal"", ""malicious damage"", ""trespass"" and ""unlawful use of a conveyance"". Each of the complainants had criminal histories involving dishonesty offences. Detective Inspector Champion agreed that dishonesty offences do have the likelihood of affecting whether the information provided by the complainants should be accepted. He also accepted that commonsense and good police practise would see information as to the criminality of complainants presented to the Commissioner as part of his deliberations pursuant to s181D of the Act.  
      
       
      
     Cost Certificate 
      
       
      
     104     
     It was submitted for the applicant that the nature of the evidence of the complainants at the District Court trial was found by Judge  
     Armitage,  
     QC to be such that there was not a reasonable basis to institute criminal proceedings. It was submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that there was no evidence that he had any knowledge of the fact that the applicant had applied for, or received, a certificate from the District Court. The applicant did not refer to this fact in his written submissions. The Director of Public Prosecutions may have had that knowledge, however, that cannot be construed as constructive knowledge of the respondent. It cannot be maintained that the respondent failed to take this into account.  
      
       
      
     105     
     Detective Inspector Champion, in his evidence, considered that the existence of a cost certificate would be a matter that should be taken into account in assessing whether a s181D order should be made. 
      
       
      
     106     
     I consider that the certificate issued under the  
     Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
      1967 would have been a matter relevant to be taken into account in assessing whether to remove the police officer pursuant to s181D . The Commissioner did not have this information before him in making his decision. The certificate was issued after the notice and submission by the applicant to the Commissioner. It was issued before the making of the order and the analysis of the applicant's submission. In these circumstances, I do not consider that this Commission should form any adverse view as to this aspect of the procedure adopted by the Commissioner for failing to have regard to the certificate. However, the certificate appears to be in that class of material which is now appropriate to be considered as part of the review before the Commission, notwithstanding that it was absent from the deliberative processes engaged in by the Commissioner.  
      
       
      
     107     
     It should be noted that Detective Inspector Champion, in cross-examination, conceded that as a general proposition successful cost applications in criminal matters show that there were deficiencies in the prosecutor's case and that it would be rare for such a certificate to issue. The certificate would typically issue if there were inconsistent versions given by the accusers at the trial.  
      
       
      
     Corroboration of Mr Wadsworth 
      
       
      
     108     
     It was submitted for the applicant that the failure of the Commissioner to consider the corroboration of Mr Wadsworth for the applicant's account meant that the Commissioner made an uninformed decision.  
      
       
      
     109     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      in reply, submitted that the Commissioner had no knowledge of the corroborative evidence given by Mr Wadsworth. Further, the applicant had not relied upon this evidence in his written submission. It was also submitted that, although the respondent knew that another police officer stood trial, he did not know what was actually given in evidence by that person or that the evidence was corroborative in nature.  
      
       
      
     110     
     The evidence of Mr Wadsworth given at the District Court trial is in evidence in these proceedings. At the trial, Mr Wadsworth denied that he attended with the applicant to engage in any of the activities alleged by the complainants. In short, the evidence of Mr Wadsworth corroborated the evidence of the applicant in the applicant's denial of the allegations made against him. 
      
       
      
     Publicity and Community Concerns about the Trial 
      
       
      
     111     
     Mr  
     Docking 
      submitted that the Commissioner did not confine himself to rules of reason and justice as he relied upon, in his reasons for decision, unknown publicity about the trial and unknown details of alleged community concern. Mr  
     Willis, 
      in reply, submitted that, although not clearly expressed, it is apparent that the Commissioner, in stating his regard for the publicity and the community concern, had in mind the need to protect the reputation of the Police Service and maintain public confidence in it. It was further submitted that these are issues which went to the public interest and were therefore relevant to his decision.  
      
       
      
     112     
     However, in his submissions, Mr  
     Willis  
     conceded it would not be appropriate for the Commissioner to take into account mere public agitation about an event for the purposes of determining whether to make an order under s181D. He also properly conceded, in my view, that the taking into account of such a consideration would be unfair to the applicant in the present proceedings.  
      
       
      
     113     
     In his evidence, Detective Inspector Champion identified that there was no material before the Commissioner or the analysts as to the nature of the publicity attended upon the trial or community concern. Furthermore, he conceded that the applicant was not told that the Commissioner intended to take into account the publicity surrounding the trial or the community outrage in assessing whether or not to remove him. The evidence of Detective Inspector Champion, as to the reliance placed by the Commissioner upon this material, is significant and hence I will set it out in full: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Do you condone and support allegations of incredible publicity being used in the s181D process? 
          
          
         A. Do I condone or support allegations of publicity being used? No.  
          
          
         Q. Why did you not stop Commissioner Ryan using that allegation in Mr Van Huisstede's matter, about incredible publicity? 
          
          
         A. Because that was the Commissioner's decision and that was the Commissioner's reasons.  
          
          
         Q. If he came to you for advice would you say that it is an inappropriate or improper matter to be used as part of the reasons justifying a section 181D process? 
          
          
         A. On the basis that it wasn't the matter that the applicant was called upon to address, I'd say it is inappropriate.  
          
          
         Q. So you accept no procedural fairness to Mr Van Huisstede in this allegation of incredible publicity was offered by the Commissioner? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Putting aside the procedural fairness aspect, I want to know, given your position, have you ever permitted in any other section 181D process the use of an allegation of incredible publicity to justify an opinion on an allegation that someone should be removed from the Service? 
          
          
         A. Have I ever allowed that to occur? No.  
          
          
         Q. But you would not let it occur, would you, at any stage if it was up to you in the section 181D process? 
          
          
         A. No.  
          
          
         Q. You agree with me? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Also, you might see on page four of Exhibit A there is a reference of shock and horror in the community? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Do you also accept that procedural fairness was never offered to Mr Van Huisstede concerning the Commissioner's purported reliance on that aspect? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. In any other section 181D matters have you permitted, as part of the justification of any such section 181D processes the use of the allegation concerning shock and horror in the community? 
          
          
         A. No.  
          
          
         Q. It is not something you would consider to be appropriate or fair to you to use at any stage in the section 181D process, if it was up to you?  
          
          
         A. In that basis or in that context, no.  
          
          
         Q. There would never be a context or a basis if it was up to you, would it? 
          
          
         A. Perhaps if public outcry, a particular issue was to become an issue in the question of the officers, something which should  
          
          
         be put to the Commissioner and that was identified as an issue to which the officer may respond and address, under those circumstances it may be appropriate but it is very much a case by case basis.  
          
          
         Q. The only time you would have is when an officer is convicted or pleaded guilty to a matter?  
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Which is the very opposite of what happened in Mr Van Huisstede's case? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Because you would appreciate that an allegation of shock and horror in the community in Mr Van Huisstede's case is out there in the ether? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. In other words you would accept that it is impossible in this reinstatement case for the Police Service or the Commissioner to justify the allegation about there being shock and horror in the community? 
          
          
         A. Yes.  
          
          
         Q. Because there is not a shred of record on the Commissioner's file to back up that allegation, is there? 
          
          
         A. No.  
         
        
       
      
     Evidence as to Acts Alleged to be Committed by the Applicant 
      
     General 
      
       
      
     114     
     The Commission has earlier mentioned the applicant's submission as to ""substantive unfairness"" and the respondent's submission in reply. The respondent also submitted that the evidentiary burden which fell upon the respondent was that described by the Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No.2) 
     . That is, once the applicant produced evidence which suggested that the legislative requirements had not been followed, the evidentiary burden shifted to the respondent to demonstrate that the requirements had been observed in a manner described by  
     Kitto 
      J in  
     R v 
       
     Anderson; Ex Parte Ipec Air Pty Limited 
      (1965) 113 CLR 177 at 189. I will return to the respondent's submissions as to the legislative scheme shortly, but for present purposes it should be noted that the respondent also submitted that even if the profile was deficient, the Commissioner had sufficient information to allow him to properly exercise his discretion.  
      
       
      
     Evidence of the Applicant 
      
       
      
     115     
     In his statement of evidence, the applicant gave evidence as to the background of s181D proceedings, including criminal charges being brought against him, his work and personal circumstances after his suspension and ultimate removal from office and his history in the Police Service.  
      
       
      
     116     
     He also gave the following evidence: 
      
       
      
      (1) That his sworn evidence at his trial given on 15 December 1997 is a true and accurate account of what happened during his shift at the Taree Police Station on 12 August 1990;  
      
      
      (2) That his submission to the Commissioner during the s181D process is ""the truth""; and  
      
      
      (3) That he has always maintained that the allegations made against him were untrue and that he still maintained that he had ""done nothing wrong"".  
      
       
      
      
     117     
     As earlier noted, the applicant in his submission to the Commissioner stated that he denied the allegations made by the complainants. He further stated that the allegations made against him were not true.  
      
       
      
     118     
     In his evidence in chief, given at the District Court trial on 15 December 1997, the applicant gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         Q. Mr van Huisstede, did you at any time on the weekend of 11 and 12 August 1990 make any offer of sexual conduct to KB2, RS, or KB1? 
          
          
         A. No, I did not.  
          
          
         Q. Were you present when any such offer was made? 
          
          
         A. No, I was not.  
          
          
         Q. Did you participate in any sexual activity with Ms KB2? 
          
          
         A. No, I did not.  
         
        
       
      
     119     
     In addition to this evidence in chief the applicant relevantly gave other evidence in chief at the trial as follows: 
      
       
        
       (1) whilst attached to the Taree Police Station during August 1990, the applicant resided in Forster located some 30km from the Police Station. The travelling time from his home to the Taree Police Station was approximately half an hour. It should be noted that in his statement of evidence the applicant indicated that on 11 and 12 August he was living in Forster and that on 11 August he had a rest day and performed station duties from 3pm until 11pm on 12 August. Additionally at the trial, the applicant indicated the following as to his activities prior to 12 August: 
        
        
         
         (i) from Thursday 2 August to Wednesday 8 August 1990 he was performing night work from 11pm to 7am. Thus, his night shift completed at 7am on Thursday 9 August 1990.  
         
        
        
         
         (ii) the applicant did not work on the balance of the day on 9 August or on Friday 10 August (which was a rest day).  
         
        
        
         
         (iii) the applicant also had a rest day on Saturday 11 August 1990 and indicated that it was very unlikely that he visited the police station at Taree on that day.  
         
        
        
         
         (iv) he also indicated that he attended the station to commence work at about 10 minutes prior to the start of the shift.  
         
        
       
       
       (2) he had a nickname of ""Efram"".  
        
        
       (3) as at August 1990, he knew KB1 as a result of performing police duties and knew of KB2 and RS but had no dealings with them and had not spoken to them.  
        
        
       (4) the applicant had no independent memory of KB1, KB2 or RS being in the cells at Taree Police Station when he commenced work on 12 August 1990 or that he had to check on those persons as prisoners.  
        
        
       (5) it was very likely that on 12 August the applicant left the Taree Police Station around 11pm. Leaving the station around completion time was his normal practice.  
        
       
      
     120     
     In cross-examination at the trial, the applicant denied the allegations put against him and, in particular, denied that he suggested that the complainants be given food in exchange for sexual favours and, in particular, oral sex. He denied that one of the complainants had oral sex with him and another of the complainants had oral sex with Mr Riley on 12 August 1990. Additionally, during cross-examination, the applicant gave evidence that, upon reviewing the custody records for the Taree Police Station, KB1, KB2 and RS were in custody on Sunday evening, 12 August 1990.  
      
       
      
     121     
     The applicant gave evidence in these proceedings on 8 November 1999. He gave evidence that his statement of evidence was true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. In summary, he gave the following evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
       (a) he had sought access to relevant records such as occurrence pads, telephone message pads, rosters and car diaries but those records had been destroyed by the Police Service. The occurrence pads were used on a daily basis and would have outlined anything that was happening on a certain day;  
        
        
       (b) he had no independent recollection if Mr Wadsworth worked on 12 August 1990. From the records of the trial, he ascertained that Mr Wadsworth had worked on the day during the 11pm to 7am shift, that is the night shift;  
        
        
       (c) Mr Wadsworth had given evidence as a co-defendant at the trial. Judge  
       Armitage 
        QC had directed that a verdict of not guilty be entered in favour of Mr Wadsworth;  
        
        
       (d) a contractor had provided meals to those in remand at the Taree cells over the weekend during which the incidents were said to have occurred.  
        
       
      
     122     
     The applicant was cross-examined on 8 November 1999. The following relevantly emerges from that cross-examination: 
      
       
        
       (1) no complaint was made by the three complainants until they were interviewed in 1995, at which time an investigation was commenced;  
        
        
       (2) in relation to that allegation, the applicant was interviewed on 5 September 1995 by Inspector Sheppard. It was identified that the applicant had read the statements made by the complainants and the allegations made therein. However, it was not suggested in cross-examination that the allegations in those statements or, more generally, the allegations that had been made against the applicant were true, although it should be noted that the following question was asked and answer given: 
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. I take it that whatever these girls say that involves you in any impropriety is still not true? 
            
           
          
         
         
         A. That is correct. 
         
        
        
         
         I also note that the applicant was asked whether the evidence he gave at the trial was the truth. He answered ""Yes""; 
         
        
        
       (3) the records held by the Police Service, in relation to 12 August 1990, showed that the duty performed by the applicant on 12 August was directly related to the prisoners in the cells; 
        
        
       (4) the applicant did not know why KB1 or KB2 would be untruthful or implicate him in such a serious matter;  
        
        
       (5) the applicant did not know, prior to being interviewed by Inspector Sheppard, of any conduct of the type complained of taking place in the Taree Police Station;  
        
        
       (6) it was unusual for three young women to be held in the cells at the Taree Police Station over a period of three days;  
        
        
       (7) a record was entered only if something had occurred out of the ordinary. The telephone diary record would have assisted in the applicant ascertaining the persons who were working on or about the days in question. The fact that it was unusual for three young girls to be held in the police station for three days did not jog the applicant's memory as to the circumstances applying on this particular occasion.  
        
       
      
     123     
     The applicant stated in re-examination, by reference to his police notebook, that he had a rest day on 10 August 1990. He also confirmed from that record that he had a rest day on 11 August 1990 and did not commence work on 12 August until 3pm. The witness was shown a copy of his notebook and confirmed that he had actually recorded the times he worked or did not work on the three days in question. He also indicated that it had not been suggested to him by anyone that he did not have rest days on 10 and 11 August. Upon tendering the notebook, the following submissions were made respectively by Mr  
     Docking 
      and Mr  
     Willis 
     : 
      
       
        
         
         [Docking]: I tender a photocopy of the notebook. I do not press it, the writing which Mr van Huisstede has said is not his. 
         
        
        
         
         [Willis]: I have not seen it before. I have no objection to it, Your Honour. 
         
        
       
      
     124     
     The applicant also confirmed in re-examination that he had a changeover day on 9 August, that is, he ceased work at 7am and did not carry out work for the remainder of that day. The applicant also denied the truth of the allegations contained in the statements made by the complainants.  
      
       
      
     Further Cross-Examination of the Applicant 
      
       
      
     125     
     At the close of the proceedings on 10 November 1999, Mr  
     Willis 
      made an application to have the applicant recalled for further cross-examination. He made the following submission: 
      
       
        
         
         My client's position, it is obvious from the reasons provided for removing the applicant from the compulsory service, does not accept the denial given by the applicant to the allegations made against him. 
         
        
        
         
         I did not put to the applicant in cross-examination either that the incident, involved in the allegations against him, in fact, occurred or that he was untruthful in his denials about it and my application in this brief form at the moment is that, given the opportunity, to have him recalled simply to put those questions to him. 
         
        
        
         
         I reasonably anticipate what his responses to those questions will be, and I would not expect that that is going to further complicate the hearing of the matter [or] the programme of the hearing of the matter by a necessity for any other evidence to be called. I make the application at this stage by way of flagging it only. It is perhaps an application I can address to your Honour by way of written submissions to be provided to your Honour at the same time that I provided the written submissions on the admissibility of the documents. 
         
        
       
      
     126     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      put that the respondent wished to put in cross-examination that the acts complained of by KB1, RS and more particularly KB2 did, in fact, occur and that the applicant's evidence denying that they occurred, or that he had no knowledge of them, was untrue.  
      
       
      
     127     
     It was submitted that it was necessary for the respondent to put those questions to the applicant to formally comply with the rule in  
     Browne v Dunn  
     (1894) 6 R(HL) 67. It was further submitted that it was clearly the case for the respondent that the applicant had not been truthful. Further, in his reasons for decision, the Commissioner had stated that he tended to believe the allegations that were made rather than the account by, and denials of, the applicant. 
      
       
      
     128     
     It was submitted that if the respondent was not permitted to put the questions to the applicant, then the applicant would be entitled to ask the Commission to draw an inference adverse to the respondent's case. Alternatively, and relying upon  
     Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission  
     (1977) 19 NSWLR 219 at 225, it was put that the  
      
      
     respondent had, by nature of the conduct of his case, made it sufficiently clear that the evidence as a whole would be contested, and therefore, no adverse inference could be drawn.  
      
       
      
     129     
     The applicant opposed the application to have the applicant recalled. It was submitted that the respondent had breached the rule in  
     Browne v Dunn.  
     That rule is a rule of conduct which is essential to fair play at a trial and a fair dealing with witnesses. It was submitted that the respondent had not given a significant reason for not cross-examining the applicant upon the truth of the allegations made against him. It was further submitted that the Commission has a discretion to exclude the further evidence because there had occurred a breach of the rule in  
     Browne v Dunn.  
     It was further submitted that if the Commission exercised its discretion to permit the recall of the applicant then it would be impermissible for the respondent to positively suggest that the applicant had committed the alleged wrongdoings. This is so as the respondent did not propose to call any witness in support of a submission that the applicant had perjured himself. This submission was advanced on two bases: 
      
       
        
       (i) relying on the decision in  
       NSW Bar Association v Kalaf 
        (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 October 1988) it was submitted that the Commission could not ordinarily be expected to make a finding that the applicant had lied. Nor could the Commissioner ask the Commission to do so on the basis of matters such as demeanour and word against word, if there is a person who is able to establish the truth of the matter (according to the respondent) and that person is not called. Ordinarily, in disciplinary proceedings where it is claimed that a party lied and a witness can speak to that issue directly, the witness should be called;  
        
        
       (ii) the respondent must be able to substantiate the allegations or justify them by evidence that it intends to call:  
       Clyne v NSW Bar Association 
        (1960) 104 CLR 186 at 201.  
        
       
      
     130     
     On 15 December 1999 the Commission determined that the applicant may be recalled for cross-examination as to the additional two questions proposed to be put by the respondent as to the truth of the allegations made against him. The Commission indicated it would later provide reasons for that decision. It is convenient to now provide those reasons at this juncture. 
      
       
      
     131     
     The rule in  
     Browne v Dunn 
      was the subject of detailed consideration by  
     Hungerford  
     J in  
     Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees & Flour & Sugar Goods Workers Union (NSW) v Gartrell White (No 2) 
      (1990) 35 IR 60. In that matter the issue concerned whether a party could lead evidence in chief to controvert the evidence of a witness where the party had not cross-examined that witness as to the issue in question. His Honour made an assessment of the relevant authorities and stated (at 64): 
      
       
        
         
         I do not apprehend the rule to operate so as to prohibit the leading of evidence by a party - that would be prejudicial to that party and thus contrary to the very concepts of fairness and justice on which the rule is based - at most, in my view, it is a rule of professional practice, which, if breached, properly enables the court to reach a certain conclusion on the relevant evidence, but subject to consideration of the evidence as a whole including the evidence on which there has been no cross-examination. In other words, a party breaching the rule runs the very real risk that the evidence on which there has been no relevant cross-examination may be more readily accepted by reason itself of non-compliance with the rule. 
         
        
       
      
     132     
     Further, after considering the judgment of  
     Hunt 
      J in  
     Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation 
      [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 15 - 16 and  
     Newton 
      J in  
     Bulstrode v Trimble 
      [1970] VR 840, his Honour reached the following conclusion with which I respectfully concur (at 67): 
      
       
        
         
         Therefore, and after extensive reviews of the application of the rule in  
         Browne v Dunn 
         , both  
         Hunt 
          J in New South Wales and  
         Newton 
          J in Victoria concluded that there was nothing, as a matter of law, to prevent a party from himself calling evidence to contradict the other party's witness even though no relevant cross-examination of that witness had been conducted. It must also be emphasised that even if a party does not call evidence to contradict the earlier evidence of a witness which was not the subject of cross-examination that evidence, in any event, need not necessarily be accepted but rather is to be considered in the totality of the evidence in terms of its own weight or cogency. 
         
        
        
       
      
     133     
     Hungerford 
      J also observed in relation to the operation of s83 of the  
     Industrial Arbitration Act  
     1940 (NSW) (at 67): 
      
       
        
         
         In my view, tribunals operating under the Act should be astute to ensure procedural fairness generally to the parties and not so as to permit a case to turn on the overly strict application of a rule of professional legal practice. The instant case, it seems apparent to me, is a good illustration of this point in that whilst Mr Newall conceded he was ""crystal clear"" on the rule in  
         Browne v Dunn,  
         it is clear to me, but only after considering the many authorities concerned, that it would be unfair to visit on the respondent any adverse application of the rule. To me, that is no more than an appropriate application of s83 of the Act requiring the Commission to be governed in its procedure by ""equity and good conscience"". 
         
        
        
       
      
     134     
     Section 163 of the IR Act is the successor to s83 of the  
     Industrial Arbitration Act 
      1940 and, in my view, his Honour's observations as to the operation of s83 are equally applicable to the operation of that section of the IR Act. The provisions of s163 of the IR Act are not relevantly excluded in this respect by the operation of s181G of the Act, which is directed to the calling of new evidence. 
      
       
      
     135     
     Upon this assessment of the rule in  
     Browne v Dunn 
      and the provisions of s163 of the IR Act, it was appropriate to allow the respondent to further cross-examine the applicant. This was so for three reasons. Firstly, it was apparent from both the procedures leading to the removal of the applicant and presentation of the respondent's case before the Commission that the respondent did not accept the applicant's version of events. Secondly, even if an inference were to be drawn against the respondent in relation to the failure to cross-examine, the assessment, if required, of whether there was any basis in fact for the allegations made would need to be undertaken having regard to the entirety of the evidence and the cases presented by the respective parties, particularly having in mind the provisions of s181F(1) and the conclusions reached by the Full Bench of the Commission with respect to the operation of that provision in  
     Newton (No.2)  
     at 79. The Commission would, in any event, be required to consider the entirety of the applicant's and respondent's cases in the light of s181F to assess whether, in the circumstances of the case, the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust for the purposes of Pt6 of ch2 of the IR Act. Thirdly, the application arose prior to final submissions. Having regard to the provisions of s163 of the IR Act, it was appropriate to permit the respondent, despite the apparent omission in the presentation of his case, to put squarely that which he contended was in issue in the proceedings, namely, that there was a basis in fact for the allegations made against the applicant. 
      
       
      
     136     
     In the result, the applicant was recalled and the following evidence was given in cross-examination: 
      
       
        
         
         WILLIS: Q. Mr Van Huisstede, on the last occasion you gave evidence in these proceedings I asked you questions about the contents of statements made by KB1, KB2 and RS. What I put to you is that the acts complained of by those three people, and more particularly by KB2, in fact occurred? 
          
          
         A. No they did not. 
          
          
         Q. And what I put to you is that on any occasion that you have denied that they did occur or that you had no knowledge of the incidents they describe, that you have been untruthful? 
          
          
         A. No, I have been truthful. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
     137     
     Mr  
     Docking  
     tendered, on behalf of the applicant, character references by John Malcolm MacLachlan and the former Mayor of Taree, Mr Ralph Metcalfe. 
       
     Mr MacLachlan was a retired police officer who had 31 years of service. He was transferred to the Taree Police Station in late 1987 and was at the Taree Police Station in January 1989 when the applicant was transferred to that station. He was the applicant's supervisor (having retired at the rank of Senior Sergeant). He noted that the applicant was transferred to Mudgee Police Patrol in 1994. He considered the applicant as a person of great integrity, honesty and truthfulness. He also indicated that the applicant interacted well with the general public and was popular with most decent law abiding citizens within the local community. He was aware of the allegations made against the applicant, but he did not believe them. He considered the applicant to be an asset to the Police Service. 
      
       
      
     138     
     Mr Metcalfe indicated that he had come into contact with the applicant on many occasions in his duties as a police officer and that he was a person of the highest integrity, honesty and trustworthiness. He had high community respect.  
      
      
     Admission of evidence of allegations made by the complainants  
      
       
      
     139     
     An issue arose during the proceedings concerning the admissibility of the brief of evidence prepared for the trial of the applicant and of extracts from the transcript from the committal proceedings containing the evidence of KB 1, KB 2 and RS. The brief of evidence consisted of statements and records of interview, including the statements made by KB 1, KB 2 and RS in relation to the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant. These documents were tendered by the respondent and conditionally marked as exhibit T in these proceedings. 
      
       
      
     140     
     The respondent submitted that the statements of the three complainants contained in the brief were part of the material available to the analyst who prepared the profile of the applicant. As such, it would be artificial for the Commission to review the respondent’s decision by reference only to the profile itself and not the source material from which that document was prepared. The respondent further contended that the “documents and other material on which the Commissioner has relied in deciding that the Commissioner does not have confidence in the applicant’s suitability to continue as a police officer” for the purposes of s181E(3) should not be confined only to the profile.  
      
       
      
     141     
     In relation to the transcript of the evidence given by KB 1, KB 2 and RS at the committal hearing, the respondent conceded that this evidence was not part of the source material which was available to the analyst for the purpose of preparing the profile. However, the respondent submitted that the evidence did relate to its case because it was evidence given by the witnesses on oath in support of the complaint made in their statements. Any inconsistencies between that evidence  
      
      
     and their statements should be taken into account in relation to the question of what weight the Commission should give to the evidence, not to the question of admissibility.  
      
       
      
     142     
     Generally, the respondent contended that the Commission should admit the evidence as to the truth of its contents and give it such weight as it considers appropriate having regard to the circumstances of its admission, including the fact that the witnesses were not called to give evidence in these proceedings. The respondent conceded that the statements and transcript are strictly hearsay evidence, but pointed out that the Commission is not bound by the rules of evidence (see s163(1)(c) of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      1996). It was submitted that in the exercise of its discretion to “act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case”, the Commission should admit the documents into evidence.  
      
       
      
     143     
     The respondent contended that there would be no prejudice to the applicant by the admission into evidence of the statements or the transcript as a result of the fact that the witnesses were not called in these proceedings. It was said that the statements and transcript do not raise any fresh matter for the applicant to answer. Both the statements and the transcript contain the evidence of the complainants as to the specific allegations made against the applicant. The applicant was legally represented by counsel at the committal proceedings who cross-examined the complainants at some length to test their evidence.  
      
       
      
     144     
     The respondent submitted that neither the statements nor the transcript constitute “new evidence” for the purpose of s181G(1)(f) because they were documents which were made available to the applicant in the process of the criminal prosecution and they did not raise any fresh issues for the applicant to answer. In the alternative, it was submitted that the respondent does not require leave of the Commission to adduce the evidence. Leave is only required if notice of intention to adduce the evidence and its substance is not given. The statements and transcript were served on the applicant’s solicitor prior to the hearing in response to orders made by the Commission.  
      
       
      
     145     
     The applicant resisted the admission of the documents into evidence. The applicant refuted the suggestion that the documents were considered as part of the decision-making process. There was no evidence to suggest that the documents formed part of the s181E(3) material upon which the Commissioner relied in making a decision to issue an order for removal or that they were part of the Commissioner’s reasons under s181F(1)(a) or part of the police officer’s response under s181D(3)(b). There was no evidence that Detective Inspector Champion examined the file in any detail and the analyst who completed the profile was not identified by the respondent nor called to give evidence.  
      
       
      
     146     
     The applicant contended that although s163(1)(b) of the  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      1996 provides that the Commission is not bound by the rules of evidence, this does not mean that the acceptance of evidence is unrestrained and the Commission is still required to act according to equity and good conscience. The applicant submitted that the evidence contains assertions which are highly prejudicial in their nature and content. This factor should, absent opportunity to test the evidence, lead to is exclusion on grounds of manifest unfairness: see  
     Amalgamated Metal Workers Union v Electricity Commission  
     (1989) 28 IR 155 at 158 - 159 and 161. The applicant cited a number of reasons why the evidence should be excluded in this case. In particular, the applicant noted the fact that each of the three complainants have criminal histories involving dishonesty offences and that there were such deficiencies in the evidence that Judge  
     Armitage 
      QC in the District Court proceedings concluded that it was not reasonable to institute criminal proceedings.  
      
       
      
     147     
     The decision of the respondent not to call the three complainants deprived the applicant of the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. The applicant argued that this would be tantamount to depriving him of a fair trial: see  
     R v Hull Prison Board of Visitors; Ex parte St Germain & Ors (No 2) 
      [1979] 3 All ER 545 at 552 - 553. It was submitted that it was absurd to suggest that the applicant would not be prejudiced as a result of the denial of the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. This case is substantially one of fact in relation to which there are direct conflicts in the evidence and the Commission faces a grave disadvantage in assessing the veracity of that evidence.  
      
       
      
     148     
     It is convenient to deal initially with the question of whether leave is required pursuant to s181G to adduce the additional evidence. This question may be shortly resolved by an examination of the relevant legislation. Relevantly, new evidence may not be adduced before the Commission unless a notice of intention to do so and of the substance of the new evidence has been given pursuant to s181G(1)(f)(i) or unless the Commission gives leave under s181G(1)(ii). The Commission may grant leave in such circumstances as it thinks fit, but must grant such leave in the circumstances set out in s181G(2)(a) - (c).  
      
       
      
     149     
     In my view, the meaning of these provisions is clear on their face. Section 181G(1)(f) provides that new evidence may not be adduced in proceedings before the Commission unless either notice is given pursuant to subsection (i) or the Commission grants leave pursuant to subsection (ii). These options are alternatives. If appropriate notice has been given then there would be no further requirement to seek the leave of the Commission. Had the legislature intended that both notice and leave be required before new evidence could be adduced it could have easily so provided.  
      
       
      
     150     
     It should also be noted in the final report of the Police Royal Commission (which was delivered prior to the passage of s181G) the Royal Commission discussed legislative restrictions in relation to the receipt of evidence which might apply in the event that the Industrial Relations Commission should be given jurisdiction to review decisions of the Commissioner to remove a police officer. The Report recommended that additional evidence be received only when the Commission was satisfied that special grounds existed. Leave would be required to introduce such evidence. By the enactment of s181G, the legislature plainly adopted a different criteria for the admission of evidence whereby leave to admit new evidence would not be required where notice is given pursuant to s181G(1)(f)(i). 
      
       
      
     151     
     Section 181G(1)(f) was considered in passing by the Full Bench in  
     Newton (No.2) 
     . The Full Bench commented (at 80):  
      
       
        
         
         … it is difficult to conceive of an “ambush” of an applicant by the Commissioner of Police of the kind outlined by Mr Hendy. Such a situation would necessarily involve new material being put of which the applicant was not previously on notice. Leave would have to be sought and granted by the Commission for the introduction of such new evidence. If leave were granted, the applicant would, in the ordinary course, be given an appropriate opportunity to deal with any such “new material”, if necessary, by an adjournment of the hearing. A development of that nature, it may be postulated, might be a matter relevant to the Commission’s consideration of whether the dismissal had been demonstrated to have been harsh, unreasonable or unjust.  
         
        
        
       
      
     152     
     In this passage, the Full Bench was not dealing directly with the admission of particular evidence. It was merely contemplating the alleged consequences of a particular interpretation of other provisions of the Act. However, the opinion of the Full Bench there expressed would appear to be in accordance with the construction I have adopted. Where the Full Bench discusses the requirement for leave to be sought, it is referring to a circumstance in which the applicant was “not previously on notice”.  
      
       
      
     153     
     Some difficulties are created by the fact that s181G(1)(f)(i) refers to notice being given “in accordance with the regulations under this Act”. Despite this provision, no regulations have been made to prescribe the manner in which such a notice should be given. In  
     Downey v Pryor 
      (1960) 103 CLR 353 at 362,  
     Kitto 
      J expressed the view that provisions requiring an act to be done “in the prescribed manner” or “in accordance with regulations” may be of two different natures. The wording, context and nature of the provision may indicate that the prescribed method is the essence of the authority conferred such that there is no authority capable of being exercised in the absence of a valid prescription of the method.  
     Browne v Commissioner for Railways 
      (1935) 36 SR (NSW) 21 is an example of such an instance. On the other hand, the means may be that the authority or act is to be subject to the power of the Executive to regulate its function, but in relation to the reference to any prescribed method the words “if any” should be implied.  
      
       
      
     154     
     In my view, s181G(1)(f)(i) is of that latter type. The intention of the provision would appear to be to ensure that neither party is surprised by any new evidence presented at the hearing through requiring that notice of intention to adduce new evidence and of its contents be given to the other party prior to the hearing. This process may have the benefit of facilitating the smooth running of the hearing before the Commission and, as pointed out by the Full Bench in  
     Newton 
     , of protecting the applicant from being “ambushed” by new evidence presented by the Commissioner. The process of notification is capable of being facilitated by the Commission in the absence of regulations and  
      
      
     the Commission can adjudicate on whether sufficient notice has been given. I note that in  
     Browne v Commissioner for Railways, 
       
     Jordan 
      CJ commented (at 29):  
      
       
        
         
         If it is provided by Statute that an application may be made to a Court within the time and in the manner and on the conditions directed by the rules of Court, this is regarded as creating a right in the applicant to make, and a duty in the Court to hear, the application, irrespectively of whether any rules have been made. In such a case there is a power in the Court to prescribe conditions by rules, but until it does so, the Court must deal with applications as justice and commonsense demand.  
         
        
        
       
      
     155     
     Even in the absence of regulations, the Commission must, in my view, allow new evidence to be adduced in proceedings under the Act where appropriate notice has been given by the party seeking to adduce that evidence. In this case, I am satisfied that appropriate notice was given by the fact that the evidence was served on the applicant’s solicitor prior to the hearing. As such, leave of the Commission is not required to adduce the evidence.  
      
       
      
     156     
     The question remains as to whether the brief of evidence and extract from the transcript tendered by the respondent should be admitted into evidence. In the particular circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that in the interests of justice these documents should be admitted for all purposes. A number of circumstances particular to this case have lead me to this conclusion. Firstly, the existence of the transcript may be an important consideration in determining the material which was available to the Commissioner. Indeed, the applicant expressly raised as an issue the failure of the Commissioner to consider the inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence when making his decision. Where one of the issues to be determined concerns whether the Commissioner gave adequate consideration to the available evidence, the existence and content of other evidence is obviously a matter which requires serious consideration. To exclude that evidence would reduce the capacity of the Commission to assess the quality of the decision-making process which was adopted by the Commissioner when removing the applicant.  
      
       
      
     157     
     Secondly, in their submissions the parties joined in raising the question of whether the allegations had any basis in fact. Mr  
     Docking 
      specifically submitted that the removal of the applicant was ""substantively"" unfair as a result of the fact that the respondent had not made out the allegations on the evidence and that the applicant was not guilty of the misconduct alleged. Whilst the respondent submitted that it was not required to prove the allegations, it was put that on the evidence before him the Commissioner was entitled to form the opinion that he did not have confidence in the applicant.  
      
       
      
     158     
     In the absence of the evidence contained in the statements and transcript, the Commission would have before it no direct evidence of the events other than the applicant’s explicit denial that there was any substance at all to the allegations. This circumstance is, no doubt, a direct result of the course adopted by the Commissioner in these proceedings. Mr  
     Willis 
      sought to tender the transcript of criminal proceedings containing the evidence of the complainants and the complainants’ statements without calling the witnesses to give evidence and be available for cross-examination. This approach by the Commissioner denied the Commission access to the best evidence available (noting that it was not put by the Commissioner that the complainants were not available or compellable to give evidence). Notwithstanding this, however, it is, in my view, inappropriate in this case for the Commission to exclude evidence which is available and casts light on the nature and substance of the allegations. As will be discussed, the substance of the misconduct alleged to have been the basis for the removal of the applicant is a matter which should, having regard to the respective cases of the parties and the reasons for the decision given by the Commission, be considered in determining if the removal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. The veracity of serious allegations, such as those raised in this case, must also be relevant to the consideration of any relief to be granted and, particularly, to the consideration which must be given to the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the Police Service.  
      
       
      
     159     
     Thirdly, a further matter which may be relevant to the admission of the transcript evidence concerns the material supplied by the applicant to the Commissioner in response to the s181D notice. It will be remembered that the applicant attached to his response a copy of his evidence given at the District Court trial. In evidence before the Commission the applicant adopted his evidence given at trial and reasserted the truth of the evidence there given. Arguably, the applicant has put his evidence given at the trial in evidence in these proceedings in his defence. It would be artificial to consider that evidence without also having regard to the evidence given by the complainants at the trial.  
      
       
      
     160     
     The applicant correctly pointed out that although the Commission is not bound by the rules of evidence, this does not mean that the admission of evidence is unrestrained. Commonsense dictates that the Commission receive only evidence which is relevant to an issue which requires determination in order to decide the case: see  
     PDS Rural Products Ltd v Corthorn 
      (1987) 19 IR 153 at 155. The requirement that the Commission “inform itself on any matter in any way that it considers to be just” (s163(1)(b)) and exercise its functions according to “equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case” (s163(1)(c)) demand that it consider any unfairness or prejudice which would be suffered by a party as a result of the admission of certain evidence. The admission of hearsay material containing evidence which is prejudicial to a party, but cannot be tested through cross-examination, has obvious potential to cause serious disadvantage to that party. I note that s181L(2) of the Act would not seem to exclude the Commission's discretion to refuse to admit hearsay evidence which was highly prejudicial (even if that evidence consists of transcripts of proceedings in a court or tribunal). 
      
       
      
     161     
     Notwithstanding the potential disadvantage to the applicant, the statements and transcript should, in my view, be admitted into evidence in order for the Commission to properly exercise its discretion under the Act. However, the failure of the respondent to call the complainants to give evidence (or provide an explanation for not doing so) must be considered when deciding what weight should be attached to that evidence. The approach adopted by the respondent of not calling the complainants to give evidence has a detrimental effect upon the weight which may be attached to the evidence contained in those statements and the transcript of evidence of the complaints. So much was conceded by Mr  
     Willis 
     . Although the complainants were cross-examined by counsel for the applicant in the District Court, this occurred in criminal proceedings and at a substantially earlier point in time. Had the complainants been called to give evidence in these proceedings, they could have been cross-examined in light of all information which has subsequently come to light, including their evidence at the trial. The Commission has also been denied the opportunity of seeing the complainants give evidence in person and so forming an opinion as to their credibility from their demeanour and attitude whilst giving evidence.  
      
       
      
     162     
     It is appropriate to emphasise before continuing that the decision to admit the brief of evidence and the transcript in this matter should not be taken to have any application beyond the circumstances of this case. There is the potential for significant prejudice to be suffered by an applicant as a result of the course adopted by the respondent in this case. The serious consideration which must be given to any prejudice to be suffered by the applicant is amply demonstrated in  
     Amalgamated Metal Workers Union 
     . In that case, the Full Bench considered the admission of statements and evidence given to a committee investigating allegations against a dismissed employee. The Full Bench commented (at 159):  
      
       
        
         
         In a case of this nature we regard this deficiency as a fundamental one going not just to weight but to admissibility. The evidence is highly prejudicial in its nature and content, and there is no practical method of properly testing it. To admit it would result in serious disadvantage and unfairness to the other side.  
         
        
       
      
     163     
     It will not be every case that this prejudice occasioned an applicant is outweighed by other factors.  
      
       
      
     The Complainants’ Evidence 
      
       
      
     164     
     It was accepted that if the brief of evidence and extracts of transcript tendered by the respondent were admitted, then two further documents tendered by the applicant would also be admitted. The first of these documents was the complete transcript of the applicant’s District Court trial. The second document sought to be tendered by the applicant was a document prepared for the applicant’s costs application to the District Court which consisted of a summary of inconsistencies alleged to exist in the evidence given by the complainants in their statements at the committal proceedings and at the trial. The evidence given by the complainants which was before the Commission, therefore, consisted of their statements given in August and September of 1995, their evidence to the committal proceedings and their evidence at the District Court trial. The Commission was also assisted by the table of inconsistencies tendered by Mr  
     Docking 
     . These various documents are now admitted into evidence and their previous conditional markings are revoked.  
      
       
      
     165     
     The substance of the allegations made by the complainants revealed in their statements and evidence at the committal hearing and trial is as follows. 
      
       
      
     166     
     The complainants alleged that they were apprehended by police some time on either Friday, 10 August 1990 or Saturday, 11 August 1990 in possession of a car which had earlier been stolen by KB1 and KB2. The complainants gave evidence that they were then held in custody on charges, including “unlawful use of a conveyance”, at cells at Taree Police Station until the following Monday morning when they appeared before the Local Court.  
      
       
      
     167     
     Each of the complainants alleged that some time on the Sunday night, that is, Sunday, 12 August 1990, three police officers came to the door of the cell in which they were being held. KB1 and KB2 identified the three officers involved as the applicant, Constable David Wadsworth and Constable Robert Riley. RS alleged that the officers present were Constable Wadsworth, Constable Riley and another officer who she thought was Constable Craig Ryan. At the committal hearing, RS stated that she had been mistaken and the third officer involved was in fact the applicant not Constable Ryan.  
      
       
      
     168     
     It was stated that one of the complainants yelled out that they were hungry and requested that the officers bring them some food. It was alleged that one of the officers said words to the effect that the complainants would be given food and coffee in return for oral sex. There were divergences in the recollections of the complainants as to which officer made the suggestion. KB1 indicated that the suggestion was made by the applicant. KB2 was initially unsure which officer made the suggestion, but at the trial gave evidence that it had been the applicant. In her statement, RS stated that she though it was Craig Ryan, but later said she could not recall. One of the complainants then apparently expressed agreement to the suggestion, although there was disagreement concerning which complainant responded.  
      
       
      
     169     
     RS gave evidence that she was taken by Mr Riley to the sergeant’s office and performed an act of oral sex on him. KB2 stated that all three complainants were taken to the lunch room whereupon RS and herself were taken to another room where RS began to fellate Mr Riley. KB2 alleged that she was then taken by the applicant to another room and she performed an act of oral sex on the applicant. KB1 stated that she was taken to the lunch room by Mr Wadsworth and no sexual contact occurred between them. The complainants were subsequently returned to their cells. RS stated that she was taken to the lunch room by Mr Riley first and given a cup of coffee. The complainants were later given some chicken and chips. No complaint was made by KB1, KB2 or RS at the time of the alleged incident. An anonymous complaint was made by a male person on 23 August 1995 and the three complainants were subsequently interviewed.  
      
       
      
     170     
     The evidence of the complainants contained in their statements and evidence at the committal hearing and trial were not the subject of detailed submissions before me. Nonetheless, the material is in evidence and I have reviewed that evidence. At this point I merely note that there were clearly a number of significant inconsistencies in the complainants’ evidence. Some of these inconsistencies are peripheral, and perhaps unsurprising, having regard to the period of time which had elapsed between the alleged events and the evidence given by the complainants. However, other inconsistencies go directly to the reliability of their recollections and led the magistrate to conclude that the inconsistencies in their accounts were “manifest”. It is not necessary in this judgment to go through the inconsistencies in the complainants’ evidence in undue detail. It may, however, be useful to indicate some of the more apparent discrepancies in their versions of events.  
      
       
      
     171     
     Perhaps the most notable inconsistency in the complainants’ evidence concerned the identity of the three officers who were alleged to have been involved in the incident. As has been mentioned, KB1 and KB2 both identified the applicant as being involved and KB2 alleged that she performed oral sex on the applicant. RS, however, did not initially indicate that the applicant had been one of the three officers involved. There were discrepancies concerning on which day and at what time the events were alleged to have occurred. The statements did not indicate what day the complainants were arrested, although RS thought that it was Friday, 10 August. KB2 thought that it had been Friday, but by the trial indicated that it must have been Saturday. Both RS and KB1 were unable to be more precise than saying that it may have been Friday.  
      
       
      
     172     
     As to the time of the alleged incident, RS and KB1 stated that the officers approached the cell late in the night, at least after 11pm and possibly up to about 4am. They stated that the applicant must have worked through the night. At the committal hearing, KB2 stated that it was “not late” and agreed that it must have been some time around 6pm. Evidence of the timing of the events may be of particular significance given the evidence produced in the applicant’s police notebook tendered during re-examination. The applicant’s police notebook revealed he did not work at all on 10 or 11 August 1990, but worked at the station from 3pm to 11pm on Sunday, 12 August 1990. The evidence of Mr Wadsworth was that he worked from 11pm to 7am on 12 August 1990; that is, not on the same shift as the applicant.  
      
       
      
     173     
     The uncertainties in the evidence extended to the course of events during the alleged incident. RS stated that she was taken from the cell alone by Mr Riley to another room and later returned to the cell where she found both KB1 and KB2 still waiting. As has been indicated, KB2 stated, in contrast, that all three complainants had been taken by the three police officers to the lunch room. According to KB2, she and RS were then taken to another room and she observed RS perform an act of oral sex on Mr Riley. It was only then that KB2 alleged she was taken to a separate room by the applicant. KB2 also stated, in conflict with the evidence of RS, that when she returned to the cell both RS and KB1 were there already. KB1 presented a different version again. In KB1’s account, RS was taken from the cell first by Mr Riley and then she was taken to the lunch room by Mr Wadsworth. KB1 stated that KB2 was left in the cell with the applicant and that both RS and KB2 were in the cell when she returned.  
      
       
      
     174     
     There were a number of other inconsistencies or discrepancies in the evidence. For instance, there were uncertainties in the evidence of the complainants as to whether they had been denied proper meals during the time they were held in the cells. RS stated that she was very hungry at the time, a statement which was supported by KB1. However, both at the committal and at trial both RS and KB1 indicated that they had received regular meals and that they probably weren’t in great need of food. In contrast, at the committal hearing KB2 stated that the complainants only received one lot of food while they were in the cells and were literally starved. KB2 changed her evidence at the trial saying that they probably did receive regular meals. The complainants also disagreed concerning whether they spoke about the incident once they were returned to the cells. KB2 said that RS told her what had happened, whereas RS denied telling anyone what had occurred at the time of the incident. 
      
     Legislation and Relevant General Principles 
      
       
      
     175     
     I turn now to a consideration of the provisions of the Act relating to the removal of police officers. The Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service precipitated successive amendments to the provisions of the Act dealing with the removal of police officers and the review of decisions by the Police Commissioner to remove a police officer. There have been, in recent years, no less than four legislative schemes dealing with the process for the removal of police officers from the Police Service. The history of the legislation provides an important background to the present provisions. These successive amendments to the Act were reviewed in detail by  
     Peterson 
      J in  
     Newton v Commissioner of Police 
      (1998) 85 IR 119 at 120-122 and I respectfully adopt the summary there given. It is nonetheless useful to provide a brief further overview of the legislative history. 
      
       
      
     176     
     The  
     Police Service Act  
     1990 (Act No 47 of 1990) initially contained provisions facilitating the initiation and resolution of disciplinary action by the Commissioner against an officer. These provisions provided for a range of disciplinary procedures depending upon the type and seriousness of the conduct involved, including unsatisfactory conduct, conduct justifying a departmental charge and conduct justifying the institution of criminal proceedings. Conduct justifying a departmental charge against an officer was under the sole jurisdiction of the Police Tribunal which would make a recommendation to the Commissioner. The Commissioner was empowered to impose disciplinary measures in relation to a disciplinary charge or criminal charge and the disciplinary measures available included dismissal. Appeal was available to the Government and Related Employees Appeals Tribunal (""GREAT"") from any decision of the Commissioner to impose disciplinary measures. 
      
       
      
     177     
     The  
     Police Service Amendment Act 
      1995 introduced into Part 9 of the Act, Division 1A, “Dismissal and Resignation of Police Officers - Police Royal Commission”. The Full Bench of the Commission has noted that the purpose of the 1995 amendments was “to provide a fast track method of dismissal to deal with ‘exceptional circumstances’ of police corruption revealed in the Police Royal Commission”:  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     at 451. As a result of the amendments, the Police Commissioner could, by order, dismiss an officer if the Commissioner formed an opinion, based on information arising out of the Police Royal Commission, that the officer had engaged in corrupt conduct or certain criminal conduct and was no longer a fit and proper person to remain a police officer (the former s181B). Existing rights of appeal were abolished, but an officer dismissed under this provision retained the right to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW for reinstatement under the unfair dismissal provisions in the then  
     Industrial Relations Act 
      1991 (the former s181B(5) of the Act).  
      
       
      
     178     
     The  
     Police Legislation Further Amendment Act 
      1996 removed s181B and replaced it with Division 1B, “Summary Removal of Police Officers in whom the Commissioner does not have Confidence”. The Commissioner was given power to remove an officer where the Commissioner did not have confidence in the officer’s suitability to continue in the Police Service having regard to the officer’s competence, integrity, performance or conduct (s181D). The right to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW was abolished (the former s181D(7)), but jurisdiction was conferred on the Supreme Court to review a decision of the Commissioner made under s181D according to administrative law principles applicable to the review of decisions that turned on the opinion of a decision-maker (the former s181D(6)). 
      
       
      
     179     
     The  
     Police Service Amendment Act 
      1997 introduced the provisions as they presently exist. The Commissioner’s power under s181D to remove police officers in whom the Commissioner did not have confidence was retained. However, the jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW to review a decision of the Police Commissioner to remove an officer from the Police Service was restored, albeit in a modified form. The Commission may now review the order under s181E(1) of the Act on the ground that the decision of the Commissioner was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. The procedure to be adopted in the case of such a review is dictated by s181F and s181G. 
      
       
      
     180     
     The various legislative schemes have been the subject of detailed consideration in a number of decisions of this Commission. The scheme created by the introduction of s181B of the  
     Police Service Amendment Act 
      1995 was considered in  
     Bigg 
       
     (No. 2)  
     and in  
     Oswald v New South Wales Police Service 
       
     (No. 2) 
      (1999) 90 IR 42. In  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
     , the Full Bench summarised the effect of s181B in the following terms (at 449):  
      
       
        
         
         (1) Where there was material before the Police Royal Commission regarding a police officer, the Police Commissioner was permitted to form an opinion, by consideration of such information, that the police officer had engaged in corrupt conduct or certain criminal conduct and was no longer a fit and proper person to remain a police officer. 
          
          
         (2) If the Commissioner formed such an opinion then, provided he proceeded in accordance with the provisions of s.181B(3) of the  
         Police Service Act 
         , he could dismiss the officer, without first meeting the other requirements of the  
         Police Service Act 
          in relation to the laying of charges against the officer.  
          
          
         (3) The existing rights of appeal against the dismissal to GREAT were abolished.  
          
          
         (4) The officer, once dismissed, retained the right to apply to the Industrial Relations Commission for reinstatement, the right to do so having been specifically and in unequivocal terms, retained by s.181B(5).  
         
        
       
      
     181     
     In the view of the Full Bench, the jurisdiction of the Commission to determine whether the dismissal of an officer was harsh, unreasonable or unjust involved a thorough analysis of the procedural aspects as well as the substance of the Commissioner’s decision. The Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     stated (at 451):  
      
       
        
         
         In our view, the question of the procedure adopted by the Acting Commissioner of Police in coming to a decision to dismiss Mr Bigg, as an exemplar of the industrial merit of the decision, as well as the general industrial merits of the decision, would both be open to review before the Industrial Relations Commission in proceedings brought under s 246 of the 1991 Act. The consideration of those industrial merits would have to include consideration of the statutory mechanism (s 181B of the  
         Police Service Act 
         ), under which the dismissal occurred.  
         
        
       
      
     182     
     It was also found that, although extremely broad powers had been conferred on the Commissioner, the Commissioner was not at large to have regard only to some of the relevant material before the Police Royal Commission. In this regard, the Full Bench relied upon the judgment of  
     Mason 
      J in  
     FAI Insurances Limited v Winneke 
      (1982) 151 CLR 342 at 368 (his Honour citing the decision of  
     Kitto 
      J in  
     R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd  
     (1965) 113 CLR 177 at 189).  
      
       
      
     183     
     The Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
      made two further observations concerning the approach to be adopted in relation to the fairness of dismissals under s181B of the Act. The observations were as follows (at 459):  
      
       
      
     ·  
     In coming to an opinion under s 181B, the Police Commissioner would have to observe and, if doubt were raised in proceedings under s 246 of the 1991 Act, demonstrate that he had met the obligation to act in a manner which allowed no allegation of an uninformed decision to be founded. Failure to do so would allow the Industrial Relations Commission to intervene, if it took the view that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable and unjust.  
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
     ·  
     Were the material in the written submission forwarded by the police officer in response to the s 181B notice to demonstrate factual and legal explanations which would call the opinion formed by the Police Commissioner into doubt when fairly considered, or were the officer to call other evidence before the Industrial Relations Commission which called the opinion formed into such doubt, then such circumstances would allow the Industrial Relations Commission to intervene, if it took the view that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable and unjust.  
      
       
        
       
      
     184     
     A similar approach was adopted in  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
     . That case concerned the dismissal of the appellant for alleged involvement in an attempt to pervert the course of justice arising out of the arrest of an alleged drug dealer. The Full Bench concluded that the removal of the police officer involved was harsh, unreasonable or unjust having regard to the inadequate approach adopted by the Commissioner in the process of considering the information arising out of the Police Royal Commission. The Full Bench in  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      stated its conclusion as follows (at 66):  
      
       
        
         
         Here, we think it is undoubted that the conclusion the appellant’s dismissal was harsh, unreasonable and unjust must follow from the inadequate approach adopted by the Acting Commissioner in the s181B process to the consideration of the information arising from the Police Royal Commission. We so find. That approach clearly led, in our view, to a relevantly uninformed decision calling for explanation by the respondent to resolve doubt. That explanation was not given.  
         
        
        
       
      
     185     
     The Full Bench expressly agreed (at 57-58) that the discretion vested in the Commissioner to remove a police officer must be exercised according to the rules of reason and justice: citing the decision of  
     Kitto 
      J in  
     R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Limited  
     (1965) 113 CLR 177 at 189.  
      
       
      
     186     
     It is useful to record the grounds cited by the Full Bench in  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      as warranting intervention by the Commission. In the view of the Full Bench, the Commissioner was required to take account of a range of circumstances including the fact that the appellant was a police officer of seemingly unblemished reputation, that the appellant had not been identified by any witness, the fact that a number of the witnesses had altered their stories and that the relevant events took place at night on an unlit road. The Full Bench indicated that the Commissioner had not properly taken into account the evidence given to the Police Royal Commission by another police officer which corroborated the evidence of the appellant. The Commission, at first instance, should have also taken who account the fact that the person who had given the corroborating evidence was not required for cross-examination. The Full Bench also concluded that the finding made by the trial judge at first instance in  
     Oswald, 
      that the appellant had perjured himself, was in error as the trial judge had made that finding without apparent consideration of the corroborating evidence (at 67). 
      
       
      
     187     
     I turn now to a consideration of the present provisions of the Act. As has been mentioned, power is conferred on the Commissioner to, by order, remove a police from the Police Service if the Commissioner does not have confidence in the officer’s suitability to continue as a police officer (s181D(1)). Various procedural requirements must be adhered to by the Commissioner in seeking to exercise this power. In particular, the Commissioner must give the officer notice setting out the grounds on which the Commissioner does not have confidence in the officer (s.181D(3)(a)). The Commissioner must give the officer at least 21 days to make written submissions (s181D(3)(b)) and must take into consideration any written submissions which are made (s181D(3)(c)). The order must also set out the reasons for the Commissioner’s decision (s181D(4))  
      
       
      
     188     
     A police officer who is removed from the Police Service by an order under s181D may apply to the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW for a “review” of the order on the ground the removal was “harsh, unreasonable or unjust” (s181E(1)). Section 181F dictates the procedure to be adopted by the Commission in conducting a review pursuant to an application brought under s181D. In reaching its decision, the Commission is required to have regard to the interests of the applicant and the public interest (s181F(3)).  
      
       
      
     189     
     It is plain that the various provisions of the Act introduced since 1995 have been intended by Parliament to establish a more flexible system governing the dismissal of police officers which permitted the Commissioner to remove officers without the bureaucratic impediments which characterised the old system. So much is clear from the discretion conferred on the Commissioner by s181D to order the removal of a police officer in whom the Commissioner does not have confidence having regard to the officer’s competence, integrity, performance or conduct. This view is confirmed by the Second Reading Speech to the Bill which introduced the 1996 amendment ( 
     Hansard 
     , Legislative Assembly, 13 November 1996 at p5912), where the Minister for Police said:  
      
       
        
         
         One of the most important tools necessary for the effective management of the Police Service is the capacity to rid the service of the deadwood. The commissioner cannot be held fully accountable whilst forced to retain the services of those who fail to live up to expected standards of competence, integrity or conduct. Yet the processes for terminating the employment of members of the Police Service seem designed to thwart any attempt to remove anyone, even those convicted of criminal offences. The royal commission has made it very clear that this situation cannot continue, and it will not continue.  
          
          
         This bill will provide the commissioner with the statutory authority to remove from the Police Service any officer in whom he ceases to have confidence. This sends a clear message to police whose dedication is less than total: shape up or ship out! This power is the cornerstone on which the new Police Service will be built. It signals the end of the road for both the corrupt and the non-performers, and a new beginning for the dedicated, hardworking and honest. The vast majority of police are of course hardworking and honest. They are constantly let down by the corrupt and incompetent. It is essential that these undesirable elements are removed to allow talent to blossom and performance to improve. The Government recognises that the authority to terminate employment under the commissioner's confidence provisions vests considerable power in the commissioner. It also recognises that this means that checks and balances are required to ensure that it is only used as it is meant to be, and is neither exceeded nor abused. 
          
          
         
        
       
      
     190     
     To support the view that the Act is intended to confer a broad discretion on the Commissioner, the respondent referred to the decision of  
     Maidment 
      J in  
     Bartlett v New South Wales Police Service 
      (1998) 87 IR 436. In that case, his Honour stated (at 452):  
      
       
        
         
         The Royal Commission shook public confidence in the management and members of the Police Service. Commissioner Peter Ryan was appointed in the hope that he would be able to turn the situation around and, to that end, he is empowered to remove a police officer in whom he does not have confidence in the officer’s suitability to continue as a police officer (s181D(1)). The Act envisages that the Police Service will be rid of persons in whom the Commissioner lacks confidence.  
         
        
       
      
     191     
     Broadly speaking, this may well be correct. However, the discretion conferred on the Commissioner was never completely unfettered, nor was it intended to be so. It was always envisaged that the Commissioner’s powers should be subject to certain checks and balances and any decision made by the Commissioner to remove a police officer would be reviewable by a specified court or tribunal. Thus, the Commissioner was, and is, required to adhere to certain procedural requirements, including giving notice to the officer of the reasons for his or her proposed removal. An officer dismissed under these provisions was, under the initial scheme, entitled to make an application under the unfair dismissal provisions then contained in the 
      Industrial Relations Act 
      1991. The subsequent amendments permitted an officer to seek review by the Supreme Court and now by the Industrial Relations Commission of NSW on the grounds specified in s181E and s181F.  
      
       
      
     192     
     The current form of the provisions undoubtedly raises some difficulties in interpretation. Jurisdiction is conferred on the Commission to conduct a “review” of an order made by the Commissioner on the ground that the removal was “harsh, unreasonable or unjust”. In conducting that “review” the Commission is required to proceed according to the sequence set out in s181F(1). The instruction that a dismissal not be harsh, unreasonable or unjust has, of course, been applied for many years in the Commission’s unfair dismissal jurisdiction. The Commission is required to determine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the dismissal of the employee was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. The Commission would not ordinarily be thought of as conducting a review of the employer’s decision, for example, in the nature of a judicial review.  
      
       
      
     193     
     In my view, the concept of a “review” must at least have the effect of directing the Commission’s attention to the decision of the Commissioner and the decision-making process which was adopted by the Commissioner. Although the removal of a police officer is based upon the confidence of the Commissioner, in my view, the discretion of the Commissioner must be exercised in accordance with the principles (earlier identified in this decision) which were discussed in both  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
      and  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
     . This conclusion flows from statements of the Full Bench in  
     Newton (No. 2)  
     at 79 - 80 with which I respectfully agree:  
      
       
        
         
         … it may be said that the statutory scheme established by the  
         Police Service Act 
          does not leave open the possibility that the Commissioner of Police will be free to act ill advisedly, or capriciously, in relation to the exercise of the obligation imposed on him by s181D(4) by failing to give a dismissed police officer proper reasons for the decision to dismiss. This necessarily follows because the discretion given to the Commissioner of Police by s181D(1) to remove a police officer from the Police Service must be exercised in the way discussed by the Full Bench of the Commission in  
         Bigg (No 2) 
          (at 457), namely, in the manner discussed by  
         Kitto 
          J in  
         R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd  
         (1965) 113 CLR 117 at 189, as follows:  
          
          
           
           … a discretion allowed by statute to the holder of an office is intended to be exercised according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion; according to law, and not humour, and within those limits within which an honest man, competent to discharge the duties of his office, ought to confine himself …  
            
           
          
         That approach applies to the whole of the exercise of the discretion given by s181D, including the obligation under s181D(4) in relation to the giving of reasons.  
         
        
        
       
      
     194     
     What may be further deduced from the decisions in  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     and  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      is as follows. In determining whether the decision of the Commissioner to remove an officer was harsh, unreasonable or unjust, the Commission is entitled to have regard to the process adopted by the Commissioner, in particular whether the Commissioner had adhered to the procedural requirements laid down by the Act. The Commissioner is not relevantly at large in the exercise of his discretion 
     . 
      Following the principles stated by  
     Kitto 
      J in  
     R v Anderson; Ex parte Ipec-Air Pty Ltd 
     , the discretion conferred by statute is intended to be exercised according to rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion. The discretion must be exercised according to law and within the limits with which an honest man, competent to discharge the duties of his office ought to confine himself. The Commission should, according to the approach in  
     Bigg (No.2)  
      and  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
     , also assess whether the Commissioner had considered all the information and materials available both in favour and against the officer, as well as the process adopted by the Commissioner in ascribing weight to particular facts or materials. It is open to the Commission to consider whether the decision of the Commissioner was “uninformed” ( 
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      at 66) in the sense that it was not based upon a consideration of all the evidence or the conclusions drawn were not reasonably open to the Commissioner.  
      
       
      
     195     
     As was said by the Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
     , the Commission should consider, to the extent relevant in a matter, both the procedure employed by the Commissioner in seeking to remove the police officer as well as the merits or substance of the decision.  
      
       
      
     196     
     In the first place, the fairness of the process adopted by the Commissioner, and particularly whether the Commissioner adhered to the procedural requirements of s181D, are vital considerations in determining whether the removal of an officer was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. In  
     Antonakopoulos v State Bank of New South Wales 
      (1999) 91 IR 385 at 389, the Full Bench stated:  
      
       
        
         
         We agree with the conclusion of  
         Hill 
          J that procedural issues, that is failure to deal with the matter in a procedurally fair way, may, in certain cases, of themselves, constitute the basis for a determination that a dismissal is harsh, unjust or unreasonable. A failure to adopt a procedure which constitutes a breach of ""an essential prerequisite to, or inviolable limitation on, the exercise of the employer's right to dismiss"" or a failure to afford procedural fairness which causes a ""substantial and irrevocable prejudice to the employee"" will often vitiate the decision of an employer and warrant, in itself, a determination that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust (and hence, establish the basis for a remedy under the Act). Further, a decision to dismiss made upon the basis of procedures which are unfair and where an innocent explanation or other appropriate explanation is reasonably available will normally constitute a firm basis for a determination that a dismissal, so effected, is harsh, unreasonable or unjust. 
         
        
       
      
     197     
     Further, the Full Bench stated (at 390): 
      
       
        
         
         While the findings of the Commission in  
         Buckman 
          focus on the issue of warnings, the observations apply also to broader tenets of procedural fairness contemplated in s88 and to matters such as those raised in these proceedings. We agree that there is no obligation in the Act to follow any particular procedure when effecting a dismissal. However, a failure by an employer to adopt appropriate procedures when effecting a dismissal, or a failure to follow procedures prescribed in an industrial instrument, or in procedures laid down administratively by an employer, may be properly taken into account by the Commission as part of the consideration of an application brought under s84. Further, as we have noted, where procedures are specified in an industrial instrument or by administrative action, a failure by an employer to apply, or to properly apply, those procedures may in appropriate cases, of itself, support a finding that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. 
         
        
        
       
      
     198     
     These comments were supported in  
     Abboud v The State of New South Wales (Department of School Education) 
      (1999) 92 IR 32 at 50.  
      
       
      
     199     
     Whilst the Commission is required to consider the entire circumstances of each case (see the decision of the Full Bench in  
     Newton (No. 2) 
      at 79) and it will not be every failure to adhere to the procedures specified by the Act which will require the Commission’s intervention (see  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
      at 460), a failure by the Commissioner to exercise his power in a manner consistent with that discussed in  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     and  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      or, more specifically, with the requirements of s181D(3) is a matter of significant gravity which may well constitute, in an appropriate case, the basis for a determination that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust. As was observed by the Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
      (in relation to the former legislative scheme) (at 458): 
      
       
        
         
         However, it seems to us that where extraordinary powers and authorities such as those given by s 181B are being exercised, a careful and punctilious regard to correct procedure should supervise the exercise of discretion. 
         
        
        
       
      
     200     
     I consider that these observations are equally applicable to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under s181D of the Act. 
      
       
      
     201     
     In  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
     , the Full Bench also considered the evidentiary burden falling on the Commissioner in relation to his adherence to the procedure dictated by the Act. The Full Bench commented (at 64):  
      
       
        
         
         … we are satisfied on the case advanced to  
         Fisher 
          P by the appellant that sufficient doubt was raised as to whether the requirements of s 181B had been met by the Acting Commissioner, in the way discussed by  
         Kitto 
          J in  
         Anderson 
         , so as to give rise to an evidentiary burden upon the Acting Commissioner to demonstrate they had been adhered to. We consider that that burden was not met.  
         
        
        
       
      
     202     
     In my view, the present provisions of the Act also establish that once an applicant raises sufficient doubt as to whether the requirements of s181D are met, the Commissioner bears an onus of demonstrating that those requirements were, in fact, met. This view is supported both by the Full Bench in  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      and by the structure of the review established by s181F. Section 181F requires that the Commission consider the reasons of the Commissioner, then the case put by the applicant and finally any case presented by the Commissioner in response. If, in the case brought by the applicant, doubt is raised as to compliance with the procedural requirements of the Act, that matter would then need to be answered in the case brought by the Commissioner.  
      
       
      
     203     
     In this matter, the applicant also raises the merits or substance of the Commissioner's decision to remove the police officer. In those circumstances, an inquiry of that kind will be appropriate in review proceedings brought pursuant to Division 1C of Part 9 of the Act. In conducting a review, the Commission is required by s181F(1)(a) to firstly consider the reasons given by the Commissioner and then the case presented by the applicant. The reasons for the Commissioner’s decision may clearly deal with the substance and basis of the allegations including, as in this case, whether there was any basis in fact for the allegations levelled against the police officer. It would be open for the applicant’s case to touch upon such issues. The case presented by the applicant, and the case put in answer by the Commissioner, may both raise matters going to the merits of the decision (again, as occurred in this case). If so, the Commission is required to consider those submissions.  
      
       
      
     204     
     I note that this proposition is supported by the decision of  
     Peterson 
      J in  
     Newton 
      at 133 and 134 where his Honour stated: 
      
       
        
         
          ... I am inclined to view that the legislation does intend the Commission to be a ""one-stop-shop"" but perhaps not limited to the sense advanced by Mr  
         Docking 
         . The structure of s181F suggests, I think unavoidably, that the Commission is free to examine the Commissioner's reasons both on the basis of the means by which they were achieved and, if necessary, their substance ... 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, one can readily appreciate that the pursuit by the Commissioner of a process may involve an approach which, by its failure in some relevant respect, leads to an unfair termination. Although based on different statutory provisions,  
         Bigg's 
          case is an example. 
         
        
        
         
         However, the matter does not end there. The requirement for the Commission to consider the Commissioner's case in answer to the applicant's case (a requirement which one would in the normal course of events think it unnecessary to stipulate) presents an opportunity for the Commissioner to traverse the substance of the reasons for dismissal rather than solely the process undertaken for their acceptance. 
         
        
        
       
      
     205     
     Furthermore, s181G(1) applies provisions of the IR Act to an application under s181F(1) in the same way as they apply to applications under Part 6 (Unfair dismissals) of Chapter 2 of that Act. Relevantly, s88 lays down matters which the Commission may take into account in determining an application alleging unfair dismissal. Section 88(b), for instance, requires the Commission to consider, amongst other things, the nature of any reason given for the dismissal and whether the reason has any basis in fact. This suggests that the Commission should examine the reasons why the Commissioner claims to have lost confidence in a particular officer and whether those reasons are founded upon an appropriate consideration of the evidence available. I might add that this was very much the approach adopted by the Full Bench in  
     Bigg (No. 2) 
      and  
     Oswald (No. 2) 
      and, in my view, remains the appropriate approach under the present provisions of the Act (see also  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     at 451).  
      
       
      
     206     
     This view of the scope of the review to be undertaken by the Commission pursuant to s181F is supported by the Second Reading Speech of the Minister for Police in relation to the 1997 amendments to the Act ( 
     Hansard 
     , Legislative Assembly, 18 June 1997, 10563), where the Minister said:  
      
       
        
         
         The bill provides police officers with the right to go to the Industrial Relations Commission to seek review of a dismissal decision. Again, whilst similar to the protection provided to other workers under the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, it is not identical as there are some important differences which I will discuss shortly. The key aspect [of the] review to be conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission will be a review of the merits of the decision of the commissioner. It will allow both the fairness of the process by which the decision was arrived at, the facts on which the decision was based, and whether the dismissal was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.  
         
        
        
       
      
     207     
     Mr  
     Willis 
      emphasised that the Act conferred a broad discretion on the Commissioner to “remove” a police officer rather than providing for the dismissal of an officer (although these contentions were not the subject of detailed submissions by the parties in the context of the proper construction of the Act). As earlier discussed, it was submitted that a distinction should be drawn between summary dismissal under the general law and the “removal” of a police officer under the Act. This distinction was said to impact upon the scope of the review to be undertaken by the Commission, particularly in relation to the merits of the decision to remove the officer. Because the “removal” was based on the confidence of the Commissioner, it was not necessary for the Commissioner to be satisfied that any particular state of affairs existed before making the order. The section, it was submitted, does not require the Commissioner to find as a proven fact that an officer is corrupt or incompetent. Nor is the Commissioner required to find as a fact that certain conduct occurred. The section does not require the Commissioner to conduct an investigation. Nor was it necessary for the Commissioner to establish to the satisfaction of the Commission that any particular conduct had in fact occurred. The purpose of the “removal” provisions was to circumvent a process whereby the Commissioner would be required to prove charges against an officer.  
      
       
      
     208     
     The issue raised by the Commissioner as to the meaning of the expression removal may be resolved relatively simply in the present matter. Whatever s181D might otherwise require the Commissioner to do in the exercise of his discretion, in this case the Commissioner did make a determination as to 'allegations' raised against the applicant in his reasons for decision. These reasons were the basis for the order made by him. Thus, the Commissioner made an express finding as to the state of affairs which existed before the making of the order and as to the acts said to be committed by the applicant. He also reached conclusions as to the factual controversy; preferring the version of events of the complainants over those of the applicant. In making those findings the Commissioner was not at large (nor, on one view of his decision, did the Commissioner consider that he was). The Commissioner's discretion is not absolute or unfettered. For the reasons earlier discussed in this decision, the principles enunciated in  
     Bigg (No.2) 
      and  
     Oswald (No.2) 
      are, for example, applicable to the exercise of that discretion. 
      
       
      
     209     
     Further, as the issue of 'substantive fairness' raised by the applicant, the respondent refers to the discretion to remove an officer in s181D as indicating a legislative intention that the Commissioner not be required to 'prove' the allegations made against the officer in the review proceedings. However, as will be later discussed, this is not a matter in which the issue of 'onus' will have any bearing upon the determination of the ultimate findings made by the Commission in this decision; particularly in relation to the issue concerning whether there was any basis in fact to the allegations made against the applicant. The findings made by the Commission are available upon the assumption that the applicant bore the onus and evidentiary burden of making out all relevant matters (see  
     Bigg (No. 2)  
     at 456 - 457). I also note in this respect the provisions of s181F(2) of the Act. 
      
       
      
     210     
     Furthermore, the applicant has put in his case that he did not commit the acts alleged and found by the Commissioner against him. That the applicant may prosecute his case upon such a basis having regard to s181F(1)(b) of the Act is  
     a fortiori 
      the case where the Commissioner has made findings about, and relied upon acts said to be committed by the applicant in his reasons for making an order to remove the officer; which reasons must be reviewed pursuant to s181F(1)(a). 
      
       
      
     211     
     The question as to whether the legislature intended to draw a distinction between the removal of a police officer and a dismissal at common law will require further examination in a matter more directly requiring a consideration of that matter and where more comprehensive submissions have been received on the issue. I shall, however, briefly consider the matter. 
      
       
      
     212     
     I note that the Commissioner relied upon the provisions of s181D(8) to demonstrate that the legislature had drawn a distinction between the dismissal and the removal of an officer. This contention would be usefully examined in the context of ss51 and 82 of the Act. However, it is not clear to me that a distinction has, in fact, been drawn by the legislature between 'dismissal' and 'removal' in s181D(8). Even if it did give such an indication, it does not seem, in my view, to affect the requirements of s181G (which is a key provision governing review proceedings under",2002-02-05 00:00:00,NSW Industrial Relations Commission

    70037/01 - REGINA v Leigh Barry GRIFFIS 
     
      
    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Leigh Barry Griffis, known as Jack, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Warren Watson. 
     
      
    2 Mr Watson was shot by the offender when they were camped near Dawes Creek in the Hunter Valley on the night of 19 August 2000. The offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 Although charged with murder, the Crown has accepted a plea of manslaughter, acknowledging that the offender acted when provoked by the deceased. 
     
      
    4 The offence was committed when both parties were heavily intoxicated and affected by cannabis. It is a dreadful reminder of the fatal consequences which can follow when a gun is available to persons who may have their faculties affected by alcohol or other drugs. 
     
      
    5 The offender and the deceased were friends. They worked together at Hunter Valley Building Supplies at East Maitland. They were both aged thirty-three at the time of the incident. The deceased was married with three children. 
     
      
    6 The offender has never been married and at the time of the incident was living in a shed at the rear of his parents’ house. He is the youngest of seven children and appears to have a close relationship with his parents and his siblings.  
     
      
    7 The offender has been a regular visitor to the Jerrys Plains area where he would commonly camp and go rabbiting, using ferrets and traps. He is skilful in these enterprises. He is known to people in the Jerrys Plains area as “Raymond Terrace” because of his place of residence. 
     
      
    8 On the morning of Friday, 18 August 2000, the deceased phoned his wife and asked her to bring him clothes so that he could go camping with the offender over the weekend. Linda Watson delivered a bag with clothing to the deceased. 
     
      
    9 The two men finished work about midday. They travelled from the offender’s home in his Toyota Land-Cruiser with a covered box trailer attached, arriving at Jerrys Plains during the afternoon. They went to the home of Patricia O’Hara, a local landowner, who gave them permission to camp and go rabbiting on her property. 
     
      
    10 During that night the deceased phoned his home a number of times by mobile phone and there was no suggestion that there were any problems. 
     
      
    11 The following day the offender and Mr Watson attended the Jerrys Plains tavern at about lunchtime. When they arrived Sarah Bullivant, a local resident, was in the bar, drinking. She did not know either the offender or the deceased. The two men consumed beer and ordered take away meals and engaged Ms Bullivant in conversation. They invited her to join them at the camp, to which Ms Bullivant agreed. 
     
      
    12 Ms Bullivant then drove her car to her home about two kilometres out of Jerrys Plains on the Singleton Road. The men followed. She left her car there and travelled with the men to the camp-site. At the camp they continued to drink intoxicating liquor and consumed Indian Hemp. Apparently, at some stage, the deceased placed his arm around Ms Bullivant, which upset the offender. He produced a firearm, which he cocked. Ms Bullivant told the offender that she did not like guns and asked him to put it away, which he did. 
     
      
    13 Later that evening, the time has not been identified, the difficulties between the offender and the deceased resulted in a physical altercation. The deceased, who was a larger man than the offender, held the offender’s face toward the camp fire, and he suffered a number of burn injuries. When he became free, he retreated to the trailer, which was attached to his vehicle where, he found his loaded shotgun which he cocked. He then returned close to the deceased where he deliberately shot him whilst temporarily not in control due to the burn injuries that had been inflicted to his face. 
     
      
    14 This account of the events is confirmed by the offender’s counsel, who has received written instructions in the matter. 
     
      
    15 The shot inflicted a massive wound to the deceased’s skull. He must have died very quickly. The offender then dragged his body into the bush and substantially covered it with dirt and leaves having partially secreted it under a log. 
     
      
    16 I have indicated that the Crown accepts the offender’s version, but submits that the provocation falls at the lower end of the scale. In particular, it is submitted that the offender had time, between having his face thrust in the fire and taking up the weapon, which places the provocation at the lower end of the relevant scale.  
     
      
    17 There is no evidence of the precise sequence of events and of the time between the struggle at the fire and the shooting. However, I infer that all of the actions occurred during a very short space of time and the actions of the deceased were a significant provocation to the offender. 
     
      
    18 Close to 6 pm Wayne Killen, who is a dairy farmer, was rounding up his cattle about 300 metres from the camp site. He reports hearing loud male voices which were aggressive and angry. However, he took his cattle to his shed, started milking and because of the noise associated with this activity, heard nothing further. 
     
      
    19 Ms Bullivant has indicated that she consumed considerable alcohol during the Saturday. At one stage she remembers going to the offender’s car and falling asleep. She has no knowledge of the events which immediately preceded the death of Mr Watson. 
     
      
    20 After she had fallen asleep, she awoke and was asked by the offender if she wanted to be taken home. She indicated that she did, and the offender drove her to her house where, when she turned the television and lights on, she noticed blood on the offender’s jeans, shirt and hands. 
     
      
    21 Ms Bullivant asked the offender “How come you’ve got blood all over you?” The offender replied, “Because I gave him a good thumping. He was going to rape you. He had it all set up to rape you, so I thumped him.” When asked if he was alright, the offender said “I had better go back and check. I left him on the side of the road.” The latter statement was not correct. 
     
      
    22 Shortly after this, the offender took Ms Bullivant to her bedroom and she later fell asleep. When she awoke at about 7.30 am the offender had left. 
     
      
    23 By 8.30 am on the Sunday, the offender had returned home. He was observed by his mother in the backyard of the house burning items in a forty-four gallon drum. Mrs Griffis observed that the offender had red marks on his cheeks and looked worried and upset. 
     
      
    24 At about 1 pm the offender was in the backyard speaking with his brothers. Mrs Griffis asked what was the matter. The offender’s brother, Colin, told her there had been a shooting and the offender immediately said, “ I am sorry Mum and Dad.” 
     
      
    25 At 2.15 pm the offender and his brother went to the Raymond Terrace police station where they spoke with Sgt Ray. The offender told Sgt Ray: 
     
      
       
        
        “I went with a friend to do some rabbit shooting. We were drinking. He pushed me into a fire then we had an argument and he picked up a gun and pointed it at me. I told him not to be an idiot and grabbed hold of the gun and we had a struggle. Then the gun went off and it copped him in the side of the head.” 
        
       
      
    26 This version of the events is now accepted by the offender as untruthful. 
     
      
    27 During the interview, the offender continued saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then I dragged him down to the creek and left him there. 
        
       
      
    28 In answer to the question, “Is he alive?”, the offender said, “I don’t know. He was breathing.” 
     
      
    29 Having regard to the nature of the injury to the deceased, this statement could not be true. The deceased lost a significant part of his skull in the blast which was from a shotgun. The police took possession of a 12 gauge single barrel shotgun from the offender’s vehicle. 
     
      
    30 Shortly after this interview, the offender accompanied police to the scene where he indicated the site of the camp fire and where the body was located. The wound to the deceased’s head was obvious. The deceased’s trousers were around his lower legs and his underpants were around his thighs and he had no shirt on. The deceased was found to have a blood alcohol level of .202 and there was some evidence of cannabinoids in his blood. 
     
      
    31 The offender was interviewed on more than one occasion and on 21 August 2000 he told Sgt Raftos “I just want you to know it was an accident. I didn’t mean to kill him.” The offender now accepts that this statement was not true. 
     
      
    32 The offender is now thirty-four years old. He is a person of limited intelligence. He left school at the end of second form and although he had not been in any trouble he found it difficult to learn and was bored. 
     
      
    33 Upon leaving school the offender obtained employment with the local sawmill where he remained for thirteen years. He began as a labourer and worked his way up to forklift driving. He then obtained employment as a forklift driver with Hunter Valley Building Supplies where he was employed at the time of the offence. His work record is good and his employer has provided him with a reference. There is other evidence of his reliability and the trust which his friends place in him. 
     
      
    34 The offender is the youngest of seven children and comes from a close family. His parents and siblings have supported him since he was taken into custody for this offence. I have no doubt that his family will assist him in his rehabilitation when ultimately released. 
     
      
    35 The offender appears to have limited social contacts outside of the work place. He spends many weekends rabbiting and fishing and for the last five years has been rebuilding a sixteen foot boat. His other after work activity is generally drinking at his local hotel. It would appear that on most days he would go to the hotel after work and remain there until well into the evening. He admits to having a problem with alcohol. 
     
      
    36 It is plain that the offence occurred at a time when the offender had consumed considerable alcohol, as had the deceased. However, there is no reason to believe that his capacity to reason in relation to the offence was relevantly affected by alcohol. It is also apparent that the three persons at the camp had consumed some cannabis during the course of the afternoon. 
     
      
    37 The offender has previously been convicted of quite minor matters initially when a juvenile. There is no suggestion of any violent disposition in him and I consider it unlikely that he would re-offend. The offender has expressed his remorse to the court and I accept, as genuine, his expressions of sorrow. He says that he will never touch alcohol or drugs or guns again. His rehabilitation will largely depend upon his resolve to remain free of alcohol and drugs in the future. 
     
      
    38 As I have indicated, the offender has pleaded guilty to the charge of manslaughter. He also significantly assisted the police with inquiries in relation to the matter. However, he did not immediately accept criminal responsibility for the events which occurred and told untruths to the investigating police. He is, nevertheless, entitled to a discount for these matters which I assess as thirty percent of the sentence which would otherwise be imposed. 
     
      
    39 The offender has been assessed by Nancy Wallace, a clinical and forensic psychologist. She concluded that he is of border line intelligence and his drug habits have led him to be impulsive or have increased his pre-existing level of impulsivity. 
     
      
    40 He has also been assessed by Ms Robilliard who also scored his intelligence as well below average range. She reports him as mildly depressed with some anxiety and phobic fears and general psychological stress. However, she concluded that this would not be uncommon having regard to the prospect of the trial which he then faced at the time of their interview. 
     
      
    41 The offender was first remanded in custody in relation to this matter on 20 August 2000. Because of an incident which occurred at the Cessnock Correctional Centre he has been held in maximum security and provided with protection. Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances of his incarceration he has been able to successfully complete a course in drug and alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    42 I am satisfied that the need to impose a sentence reflecting personal deterrence of the offender is not great. However, it is a very serious matter to take a human life and there is a significant need to impose a sentence which will deter others from acting in a similar manner in the future. Every member of the community needs to be reminded of the volatile circumstances that can arise when excessive alcohol and drugs are combined. Those volatile circumstances can easily be turned to tragedy when a gun is present. Our community accepts that there are legitimate reasons for guns to be carried but unless extreme caution and discipline is exercised by those having access to them a tragedy such as the present is a constant possibility. 
     
      
    43 I have received a victim impact statement from the deceased’s wife and mother. It is plain that these dreadful events have had a traumatic effect upon these persons and the deceased’s children. No words from the court are adequate to express the community’s sympathy in their great loss. However, I may not, as a matter of law, take these statements into account in fixing a sentence. 
     
      
    44 Counsel for the offender has submitted that I should find special circumstances and provide a non parole period less than provided by the statute. It was submitted that the problems which the offender has had with alcohol and drugs and the fact that he has been incarcerated for the first time reflects special circumstances. I am not persuaded that such a finding is appropriate in the present case. 
     
      
    45 Leigh Barry Griffis you have pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter. I have heard and taken into account all of the matters that have been put by counsel on your behalf. I have had particular regard to the circumstances in which the offence occurred and I have also had regard to your early plea and the assistance you gave investigating police. 
     
      
    46 You are convicted of manslaughter. You are sentenced to a term of seven years full time imprisonment to commence on 20 August 2000 and expiring on 19 August 2007. I fix a non parole period of five years and three months. Accordingly you will be eligible for parole on 19 November 2005.

      REGINA v Jonathon PERESE 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with McClellan J. 
      
       
        
       
     2 HULME J: On 26 May 2000, Judge Kirkham sentenced the applicant for leave to appeal in respect of a charge that, on 12 February 1999 at Parramatta in the company of other persons he robbed a bank officer of approximately $99,000, the property of the National Australia Bank. 
      
       
     3 Taken into account was a further offence of, on 17 June 1999, again in company, robbing another bank officer of some $26,500, the property of Westpac Banking Corporation. 
      
       
     4 Pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act each offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment although, because the second was taken into account and not itself the subject of a separate charge, no penalty greater than the twenty years prescribed in respect of the first charge could be imposed – see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 33(3). 
      
       
     5 The sentence which was imposed was one of six years and six months imprisonment. Finding special circumstances in the applicant’s youth, contrition and regret which his Honour accepted as genuine, the view that the applicant’s prospect for rehabilitation was good and his need for an extended period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service after the applicant’s release, his Honour imposed a non parole period of four years. Both periods were ordered to commence upon the date of the applicant’s arrest namely 17 June 1999. 
      
       
     6 In support of the application for leave to appeal against the sentence, it was submitted that:- 
      
       
        
         
         1. Judge Kirkham erred in failing to apply or properly consider the guideline judgment of this court in  
         R v Henry 
          (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
          
          
         2. Judge Kirkham erred in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
          
          
         3. Judge Kirkham erred in failing to articulate and specify the way in which the sentence was arrived at and calculated (having regard to the fact that another offence was taken into account). 
          
          
         4. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
       
     7 It will be convenient to address the second and third of these grounds first. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
         
           
         Judge Kirkham erred in failing to give adequate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty. 
          
         
        
       
     8 It is acknowledged that his Honour stated that he took the applicant’s guilty plea into account but it was submitted that, by itself, this was insufficient and his Honour should have spelt out the way he did so, the level of discount he allowed, and the basis for the level adopted. Reference was made to the guideline judgment on this topic, R v Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
      
       
     9 Judgement in that case was handed down some three months after the applicant was sentenced so his Honour can hardly be criticised for not following any course there dictated for the first time. In any event the relevant part of the guideline was expressed in terms that “sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence in so far as they believe it appropriate to do so”. In the face of a statement so expressed, the omissions of his Honour encompassed by this ground cannot possibly be regarded as errors of law arguing for the allowance of the application. The ground fails. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
         
          
           
           Judge Kirkham erred in failing to articulate and specify the way in which the sentence was arrived at and calculated (having regard to the fact that another offence was taken into account). 
           
          
         
        
       
     10 In Pearce v Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 a majority of the High Court said “a judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality”. 
      
       
     11 Their Honours also said “it is highly undesirable that the process of sentencing should become any more technical than it is already” and “[E]xcessive subtleties and refinement” must be avoided.” 
      
       
     12 In that case their Honours were dealing with sentences imposed in respect of counts in an indictment and not circumstances where offences had been taken into account under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or its equivalent. While some of their Honours’ reasoning undoubtedly applies in this second situation, the situation often involves additional considerations also. Very often a substantial number of offences are taken into account with a view to “cleaning the slate”, and a judge is told relatively little about them. That is not, of course, this case but it does to my mind indicate that what the High Court said should not be taken as necessarily governing the situation where offences are taken into account. 
      
       
     13 It would in my view be utterly impractical to require that in all cases where the procedure under s 33 is invoked individual sentences be stated in respect of all offences taken into account. To dictate that, as a matter of law, it must be stated in some cases will only lead to numerous arguments about when such a procedure should be followed and I do not believe the decision in Pearce should be extended generally to cover offences taken into account as distinct from offences charged. 
      
       
     14 On the other hand, those considerations of practicality do not apply to the offence or offences charged. I see no reason why the considerations adverted to by the High Court should not lead judges to identify the penalty that would have been imposed had there been no offences taken into account. Indeed, for reasons of transparency and demonstrating that justice is both done and seen to be done, it is eminently desirable that such a course be followed.  
      
       
        
       Grounds 1 and 4 
        
         
          
           
           1. Judge Kirkham erred in failing to apply or properly consider the guideline judgment of this court in  
           R v Henry 
            (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
           
          
         
        
       
      4. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     15 It is convenient to consider these grounds together.  
      
       
     16 It was acknowledged that his Honour addressed all of the characteristics in respect of which the guideline in R v Henry was set and that, while his Honour did not specifically state whether he had formed the view that the applicant fell within the range of circumstances where the guideline should apply, his Honour had said that it did not apply to the applicant’s brother, one of his co-accused, and that the criminality of the two could not be distinguished. It was submitted that this was erroneous and that his Honour should have considered the guideline as setting the appropriate range of penalty, should then have considered whether there were any aggravating or mitigating features warranting a sentence above or below that range and should have considered the actual sentence imposed and the reasoning adopted in the actual re-sentence of Messrs Henry and Barber, two of the seven offenders whose situation was considered in the course of the hearing leading to the guideline judgments. 
      
       
     17 A short answer to the last of these submissions is that his Honour was not asked to do so. Furthermore, he was under no more obligation to consider the particular sentences imposed on those two offenders and the reasoning peculiar to them than he was to consider what this Court has said in any of the numerous cases for similar offences which have come before it. His Honour’s primary obligation was to pay appropriate attention to the statute and general sentencing principles. Other statements of this Court may have been helpful but his Honour was under no such obligation as that suggested. 
      
       
     18 Consideration of the other arguments requires some further reference to the circumstances of the offence and of the applicant. The circumstances of the offence charged were that the applicant, a brother and a third person jumped over the service counter of the bank, ordered members of the staff to stand back, appropriated the money the subject of the charge and ran out of the bank. It would appear that there was a fourth person acting as look out. No weapons were produced or sighted. The applicant’s fingerprints were found in a position virtually impossible for a customer to reach. When, on 18 June 1999, the applicant was formally questioned about the robbery of the bank, he asserted he knew nothing about it and had never been inside the bank. 
      
       
     19 The offence at the Westpac Bank took a similar form. Shortly afterwards the applicant was arrested. In respect of this offence also, when interviewed he denied his involvement. Virtually none of the proceeds of the offences has been recovered. 
      
       
     20 The applicant was born on 9 February 1981. In March 1997 he was charged with two counts of armed robbery in company. In due course he was convicted and sentenced to a control order for approximately seven months. Later that year he was convicted of further charges of robbery and assault with intent to rob. In February 1998 he was charged and convicted of breaking and entering and stealing. In June 1998 in Queensland he was found guilty of two counts of wilful destruction and one recorded as “enter premises and commit an indictable offence plus break”. It may be that no conviction was recorded under a provision similar to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
      
       
     21 He had had a poor upbringing, his mother abandoning the family when he was five. He left school at fourteen at which age narcotics abuse commenced. He has virtually no work experience. Since incarceration he seems to have applied himself to various courses which are available. He has impressed his drug counsellor with his response and attitude. 
      
       
     22 In R v Henry this Court said as a guideline that sentences for offences having the characteristics set out below should generally fall between four and five years for the full term. The characteristics were:- 
      
       
       
       1. Young offender with no or little criminal history. 
        
       2. Weapon like a knife, capable or killing or inflicting serious injury. 
        
       3. Limited degree of planning. 
        
       4. Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
        
       5. Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
        
       6. Small amount taken. 
        
       7. Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
        
       
     23 The circumstances to which I have referred above show that in the case of both offences: 
      
       
        
       1. The applicant was young – just 18 - but had a substantial criminal history for somewhat similar offences. 
        
       2. There was no evidence of a weapon. 
        
       3. The circumstances suggest considerably more than a limited degree of planning: Certainly there is nothing to suggest that planning was only of limited degree. Kirkham DCJ said there was some planning. 
        
       4. There was no actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
        
       5. The victims were not in the vulnerable positions of shopkeepers or taxi drivers. 
        
       6. The amounts taken - $99,000 and $26,500 were not small, either as that term would be understood generally or as it was used in  
       R v Henry 
       . 
        
       7. The applicant pleaded to one and in effect to both offences. In the case of both the Crown case would seem to have been strong. 
        
       
     24 I should say a little more about the fifth of these matters. Kirkham DCJ said that the victims were in a vulnerable position being bank officers. While clearly banks and their employees are vulnerable to attacks such as those committed by the applicant and his accomplices, this is not the sort of vulnerability to which the court was referring in R v Henry. Banks commonly have significant security devices or systems in place and their employees are not generally isolated as are the type of victims to which reference was being made in R v Henry. However, given the much larger amounts of money commonly to be found in banks, the difference between, on the one hand, them and their employees as victims and, on the other hand, those victims to which R v Henry was referring, is not a factor tending to make a robbery of a bank less heinous or deserving of punishment than robbing of a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
      
       
     25 So far as the other matters listed are concerned, the absence of a weapon such as a knife or gun argues significantly for lesser criminality than an offence which involves such a weapon. I appreciate that under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act both robbery in company and robbery whilst the offender is armed with an offensive weapon or instrument carry the same maximum penalty but experience and the authorities show that the risks associated with the mere presence of a lethal weapon in the stressful circumstances of a robbery are such that it is a seriously aggravating circumstance.  
      
       
     26 However, the other differences between the circumstances here and those contemplated in R v Henry operate adversely to the applicant. He was clearly a recidivist who had used up the leniency generally extended to first, or near first, time offenders. The amounts taken also argue for a punishment higher than when the amount is small. Those who adopt the role of criminal for high stakes must expect that the courts will follow a similar approach with a view to ensuring there is a sufficient disincentive to discourage repetition. 
      
       
     27 In totality, the differences between the applicant and each of his offences on the one hand, and the circumstances the subject of the guideline, were such that, absent other mitigating features – and there were none - each offence merited a sentence in a range higher than the four to five year guideline indicated in R v Henry. Whether this conclusion be reached by saying that that guideline has no application or that it does, but the facts of this case require some upward adjustment does not matter. The fact is that the applicant in robbing the National Australia Bank committed an offence for which the penalty prescribed by Parliament is twenty years imprisonment. The circumstances were not within the category of a worst case calling for that penalty but the applicant’s record and the amounts taken place that offence well up the scale.  
      
       
     28 But there was in addition the offence which was taken into account. As a completely separate offence under s 97(1) in its own right it merited a substantial penalty or increase in the penalty otherwise appropriate. Having regard to the applicant’s record and to the amount involved, I am by no means persuaded that the applicant’s sentence, had it been imposed for the offence charged alone, would have been manifestly excessive. Once the second offence was taken into account, the sentence imposed on the applicant was, having regard to his offences and antecedents, lenient. 
      
       
     29 This conclusion provides a further answer to any operation being given to the applicant’s third ground of appeal. Once recognition was given to the sentence the applicant deserved for each of his offences, the exercise which the applicant urged in ground 3 should be undertaken, would not have availed him even after principles of totality were allowed their proper operation. 
      
       
     30 The conclusion makes it unnecessary to embark on the question of whether when an offence is taken into account pursuant to the provisions of s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the penalty, or increase in penalty, imposed in consequence of it should be less than had that offence been made the subject of a specific charge. However as the matter has been argued, McClellan J has entered upon the topic, and I have been a party to some inconsistency in approach apparent on the authorities, it may be appropriate for me also to do so. 
      
       
     31 Section 33 reproduces provisions which, with presently immaterial differences, have been present in the criminal legislation of this state for many years and it is unnecessary to reproduce it here. The section enables a court when sentencing an offender for an offence to take into account other offence(s) with which the offender has been charged. However, the court can only do so with the consent of the offender and if he admits his guilt to those further offence(s). Even if the court does take the further offence(s) into account, the penalty imposed must not exceed that prescribed for the principal offence. By virtue of s 34, a court taking offence(s) into account can impose no separate penalty for them.  
      
       
     32 In relation to one of the preceding pieces of legislation, it was said in this Court by Campell J, with the concurrence of Yeldham J as long ago as Vougdis and Rossides (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 129 that “I do not consider that there is any limitation as to penalty placed by practice or principle upon the sentence where matters are taken into account under a ninth schedule, other than that provided for in the section itself.”  
      
       
     33 In Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368, those remarks were endorsed by Hunt CJ at CL. His Honour went on to add that “Whatever the practice may have been before Vougdis, it is wrong in principle that there should only ever be little by way of addition to the penalty imposed upon the offence charged when another offence is taken into account pursuant to s 21” of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Loveday J concurred and, so far as this aspect is concerned, so did Allen J.  
      
       
     34 In Bavadra [2000] 115 A Crim R 152 at 158 Wood CJ at CL, with the concurrence of Beazley JA and Greg James J, said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “When serious offences are included in a Form 1, the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement. It is not the case that Form 1 offences need only be noted in passing, or that little by way of additional penalty should be imposed by reason of their existence:  
         Morgan  
         (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372 per Hunt CL at CL. 
         
        
        
         
         There is a considerable advantage to the administration of justice, and to accused persons, for a party facing sentence to clean up the record. For that purpose the Form 1 procedure is beneficial. The objective of individual rehabilitation can be advanced by its use, since the offender does not face the prospect of further trials. There is a utilitarian value in the admission of guilt that is involved so far as there can be a saving of the resources of the law enforcement agencies and the courts concerned. Additionally, the sentencing judge is placed in a position where it is possible to sentence the offender for the totality of his or her outstanding criminality to that point. However, unless proper weight is given to the additional offences that have been disclosed, this procedure fails its true purpose.” 
         
        
       
     35 In R v Dawson [2000] NSWCCA 399, with the concurrence of Barr J, and after citing the above passage from Morgan I said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “It was asserted by Mr Byrne, senior counsel who appeared for the Applicant that one of the purposes of s21 was to enable an offender’s slate to be wiped clean and, perhaps as an inducement to have this done, the practice in the sentencing courts was to impose substantially less by way of penalty for matters taken into account than would occur if they were included in an indictment. To the extent to which the application to have matters taken into account amounts to an acknowledgment of guilt and any punishment for them and the offence charged must reflect principles of totality, it is of course proper that the penalty imposed for matters taken into account be less than if those matters had stood alone as individual and lone charges. Often the operation of the principle of totality may have the effect that relatively little is added for the charges taken into account. 
         
        
        
         
         However, subject to the limits imposed by s21 itself, (now replaced by s33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) it seems to me that there is no basis in either the statute or logic to justify a general approach of treating matters taken into account as thereby meriting a lower penalty than had they been the subject of specific charge. If the practice of sentencing courts is as Mr Byrne asserts, it is in my view, wrong.” 
         
        
       
     36 However, in R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5, Simpson J said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The procedure so afforded is not a procedure whereby an offender can admit to the commission of offences, and wipe the slate clean without incurring any additional penalty. Nor is it a procedure which necessarily results in only a small penalty additional to that which would otherwise have been imposed in relation to the principal offence:  
         Morgan  
         372. In saying this, I recognise that an offender who adopts the procedure is entitled to expect that the additional penalty will be significantly less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted. If that were not so, the section would provide no incentive for the use of the procedure, which is administratively convenient both to the prosecution and to the courts. For it to be attractive to an offender, it must afford some benefit to him or her also.” 
         
        
       
     37 In R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63 Carruthers J said that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is important to recall that in  
         Morgan 
          … Hunt CJ at CL emphasised that when dealing with matters of a Form 1 an otherwise appropriate sentence for the foundation offence should not be only slightly increased when the offences to be taken into account in the Form 1 are serious in their own right.”  
         
        
       
     38 In a separate judgment the Chief Justice also accepted Vougdis and Morgan. His Honour went on to say:- 
      
       
        
         
          
         “In the present context it is clear that the provisions of the statutory regime to which I have referred must have the effect of resulting in a longer sentence or greater penalty than would have been the case if one was dealing only with what is referred to as the primary offence. This has frequently been acknowledged in the authorities. ( 
         R v Bachelor 
          (1952) 36 CAR 64 at 67-8;  
         R v White 
          (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 12-14; and  
         R v J 
          (1992) 59 SASR 145 at 152). 
         
        
        
         
         The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express position in subs 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. “ 
         
        
       
     39 Sperling J agreed with the reasons of the Chief Justice and Carruthers J. 
      
       
     40 In R v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 322 Simpson J returned to the topic. On this occasion her Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “A judge sentencing for an offence in relation to which he or she is asked to take into account additional offences should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences: ( 
         R v Morgan 
          (1993) 70 A Crim R 368;  
         R v Barton 
          [2001] NSWCCA 63, unreported, 5 March 2001;  
         R v Bavadra 
          [200j] NSWCCA 292; 115 A Crim R 152. “ 
         
        
       
     41 Her Honour went on to refer to many of the passages I have quoted above, including some of my remarks in Dawson, expressing the view that her opinion stated in Lemene was consistent with that expressed by Wood CJ at CL in R v Bavadra. She continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “A particular difficulty confronts sentencing judges where the additional offences are numerous or very serious. The only restriction placed upon the sentencing judge is that the sentence imposed for the offence in relation to which the additional offence is (or offences are) taken into account must not exceed the; 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
     42 Spigelman CJ and Einfeld AJ agreed with Simpson J.  
      
       
     43 What conclusions follow from the statutory provisions and the remarks that I have quoted. It seems to me that they include the following. Firstly, the taking into account of the additional offences should generally lead to a higher sentence than would otherwise have been imposed. The additional offences demonstrate greater criminality than had the offence charged, and in relation to which the additional offences were taken into account, stood on its own. As the Chief Justice said in R v Barton, “ a court … takes into account the matter for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing a penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence”. The first sentence in the passage I have quoted from  R v Lemene is to similar effect. 
      
       
     44 Of course, I do not suggest that a higher sentence will result in all cases. Sometimes the offences taken into account are almost but incidents of the offence charged. Sometimes the criminality in them pales into insignificance compared with that involved in the offence charged. And no doubt there are other circumstances which will lead to the same result.  
      
       
     45 Secondly, to adapt the words of Wood CJ at CL in Bavadra, “proper weight (should) be given to the additional offences” and “the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement”. I acknowledge that the last passage was contained in a sentence wherein his Honour was referring to serious offences. However it cannot be thought that his Honour intended an illogical departure from the basic principle that all sentences, not only those for serious offences, should reflect the criminality involved. See also the first sentence I have quoted from R v Harris.  
      
       
     46 Thirdly, at least many other common facets of sentencing practice are to be taken into account. These include acknowledgments of guilt, principles of totality and the utilitarian benefits resulting to the justice system. – Bavadra and R v Dawson. 
      
       
     47 Fourthly, subject to the statutory limit and two other matters, there is nothing to suggest that in the determination of the weight to be given to the offences taken into account, there should be any departure from normal sentencing principles. 
      
       
     48 One of these matters is the Chief Justice’s suggestion that the way in which the court takes additional offences into account is by giving greater weight to personal deterrence and retribution – only two of the five purposes of criminal punishment mentioned in Veen v R (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR465 at 476. His Honour cited no authority for the implicit suggestion that the other three purposes do not figure in the exercise and, with respect, I am unable to see that they should not. Protection of the community and general deterrence, to mention two of the other purposes, are no less important in the case of the burglar who has a dozen or so such offences taken into account. And in Bavadra Wood CJ at CL referred to the issue of rehabilitation. 
      
       
     49 The second of the matters is Simpson J’s statement in Lemene that:- 
      
       
        
         
         “an offender who adopts the procedure (of having offences taken into account) is entitled to expect that the additional penalty will be significantly less than would have been imposed had separate charges been prosecuted. If that were not so, the section would provide no incentive for the use of the procedure, which is administratively convenient both to the prosecution and to the courts. For it to be attractive to an offender, it must afford some benefit to him or her also.” 
         
        
       
     50 It would appear from the report that in R v Lemene Simpson J was not referred to Bavadra or Dawson. However she was clearly aware of these authorities in R v Harris where she said, with the concurrence of the other members of the court that her opinion stated in Lemene was consistent with that expressed by Wood CJ at CL in R v Bavadra.  
      
       
     51 With respect, I am unable to agree. Firstly, in R v Bavadra Wood CJ at CL drew attention to a number of benefits to an offender in agreeing to have offences taken into account which would exist irrespective of whether there was a discount for adopting that procedure rather than pleading guilty to the same offences charged. Secondly, while Wood CJ at CL recognised that “there can be a saving of the resources of the law enforcement agencies and the courts concerned”, that is not a necessary incident of the adoption of the procedure. Thus while in the case of this offender, the offence charged was that committed at the National Bank and that committed at the Westpac Bank was taken into account, his co-offenders were charged with the offence committed at the Westpac Bank and in the case of one of them the offence at the National Bank was taken into account. The applicant and his co-offenders were dealt with together before Judge Kirkham. It seems clear that both offences were fully investigated and there is nothing to suggest that there was any benefit to the administration of justice from the adoption of one course rather than another. Previous experience – e.g. in R v Kay [2000] NSWSC 716 is to similar effect.  
      
       
     52 I do not doubt for one moment that where there is utilitarian benefit to the justice system from the taking into account of additional offences it is appropriate that that be recognised in a sentence lower than would otherwise be imposed. Considerations which result in discount for a plea of guilty – see R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 so dictate. And as in the case of a plea, the reward or discount given to an offender should, within limits, vary with the benefit to the justice system. 
      
       
     53 Of course when offences are taken into account, general considerations such as totality are likely to operate as reducing factors. An offender’s willingness to admit to the offences may be a firmer indication of contrition and prospects of rehabilitation. However, as I said in R v Dawson, I see no justification for a general approach of imposing a lower penalty for matters taken into account than when they are the subject of a charge, in effect, just because they figure on a different piece of paper. Experience shows that it is impossible to predicate that in all cases, the justice or law enforcement systems benefit from the difference and there is otherwise no basis in the statute or logic for introducing yet another discount from what the considerations in Veen v R (No 2) would indicate to be a proper sentence. 
      
       
     54 Because of the length of the sentence imposed, I would propose that leave to appeal be given. However, the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
     55 Before leaving the matter, there is one further matter to which I would wish to advert. During the course of the appeal, statistics kept by the Judicial Commission in respect of offences under s 97(1) were brought to the court’s attention. They reveal that since May 1999 (when the decision in R v Henry was delivered), of 205 offenders dealt with for offences under s 97(1) and who were under twenty-one and who had pleaded guilty, 165 were sent to prison. Of those that were, 57 or 34% had head sentences imposed of, or of less than, 36 months, and 80 or 48% had head sentences imposed of, or of less than, 42 months. 
      
       
     56 Of the 165 sent to prison, 82 (50%) had minimum, fixed or non-parole periods of 18 months or less. A further 38 (23%) had minimum, fixed or non-parole periods of between 18 and 24 months and a further 19 (12%) had minimum, fixed or non-parole periods of between 24 and 30 months. 
      
       
     57 I appreciate that not all offences under s 97(1) are as serious as those fulfilling the guidelines in R v Henry, generally meriting head sentences of between four and five years, but the above statistics do give cause for concern that insufficient attention is being given to both what was decided and the reasons in that case. For the prevalent and serious offences falling within s 97(1), only 45 out of 205 offenders (22%) falling within the description indicated were sentenced to non-parole or minimum terms of more than two years. It is perhaps no wonder such offences are prevalent. 
      
       
     58 Since the above was written the High Court has made its decision in Wong and Leung v R [2001] HCA 64. Notwithstanding the remarks in that case concerning guideline judgments, when regard is had to the limited reliance which I have placed on the guideline in R v Henry, I do not regard it as necessary to rewrite anything I have said. However I would add this. I was a member of the Court in R v Henry. I took the view that as a general proposition, an appropriate sentence for offences of the nature described in the guideline should be higher than did the majority. I set out at some length my reasons for that conclusion. Not all that I said applies to the circumstances here, particularly because of the absence of a weapon, but much does. I do not need to repeat them but the remarks that do apply demonstrate that the sentence imposed by Judge Kirkham was not excessive, let alone manifestly so. 
      
       
        
       
     59 McCLELLAN J: The applicant, Jonathon Perese, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him by Kirkham DCJ on 26 May 2000. The applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with the offence of robbery in company. The offence is one for which s 97(1) of the Crimes Act provides a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. Although the indictment included only one offence, the sentencing judge was asked to take into account, under s 33(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the fact that the applicant also participated in another robbery in company with his brother who participated in both robberies. 
      
       
     60 The applicant was sentenced to a term of six years and six months imprisonment, and Kirkham DCJ, having found special circumstances, set a non-parole period of four years. 
      
       
     61 The applicant submits that the sentence imposed was excessive. It is submitted that: the sentencing judge failed to correctly apply the principles provided in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; failed to give adequate weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty; erred by not separately identifying the component of the sentence relating to the other offence, and; imposed a sentence which was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     62 The offence on the indictment was committed on 12 February 1999 when at about 5 pm the applicant, his brother, Leasuasu Perese, and a third man entered the National Australian Bank at Parramatta. They jumped over the service counter, intimidated the staff who were made to stand back against a wall and took a total of $99,000 including money from a safe. No weapon was apparent, the offenders escaping on foot. No person was injured. None of the stolen monies has been recovered. 
      
       
     63 The other offence took place at about 3.50 pm on 17 February 1999 when the applicant, his brother, another male and a female entered the Parramatta branch of the Westpac Bank. The female joined the queue and, when at the counter, one of the men lifted her onto it where she cried out “Don’t hit the button”, a reference to the button that operated the robbery shutters in the bank. The men then jumped over the counter and threatened the staff and took cash totalling $26,532. Again, no weapon was observed and no one was injured. 
      
       
     64 The applicant was arrested later that day. A search of the premises where he was found with his brother recovered cash totalling $1,100. 
      
       
     65 Kirkham DCJ was urged to consider the appropriate sentence having regard to the guideline judgment of this Court in Henry. His Honour expressly determined that it was not applicable with respect to Leasuasu Perese, however, with respect to the applicant, the position is not entirely clear. Although Kirkham DCJ does not indicate whether Henry should be applied, his Honour considers the matters relevant to sentence having regard to the factors identified as relevant in Henry. 
      
       
     66 The decision in Henry concerned the offence of armed robbery and the principles which it provides must be understood as particularly relevantly to an offence which involves a weapon (p 380). Because the present matter did not involve a weapon, the guidelines set out in Henry were of less utility than might otherwise have been the case. 
      
       
     67 Kirkham DCJ identified the following matters as relevant when sentencing the applicant. 
      
       
        
       1. The applicant was, at the date of sentence, aged nineteen years and although young, he has a significant criminal history. His first appearance was before the Cobham Children’s Court, on two charges of armed robbery in company. Following an appeal there was a reduction in the control order provided. In December, 1997, some three months after the amelioration of his control order, he appeared again at the Cobham Children’s Court on one charge of robbery, one of assault with intent to rob and three of robbery in company. A further control order was imposed of some ten months. Two months later he appeared at the same court on one count of break, enter and steal. In June 1998 he appeared at Redcliffe Magistrate’s Court in Queensland on two charges of wilful destruction and was dealt with according to the equivalent provisions of the then s 556A of the  
       Crimes Act 
       , now s 10 of  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        1999. He appeared again at the same court on 29 June 1998 on a count of break and enter and, together with Leasuasu Perese, he was dealt with in the same way. 
        
       2. Although he, at first, denied any involvement in the robbery when indicted, he pleaded guilty to the offence. He also asked that the second matter be taken into account. 
        
       3. In neither of the matters was a weapon used. 
        
       4. There was a degree of planning between the applicant and his brother in relation to the offences. 
        
       5. There was no violence in either robbery although there was the real threat of violence. 
        
       6. The victims, being bank officers, were in a vulnerable position. 
        
       7. Large amounts were stolen, $99,000 at National Australia Bank and $26,000 at Westpac. 
        
       
     68 Kirkham DCJ found that it was necessary to consider the principles of totality when sentencing, stating that the crimes displayed criminality in the mid range of seriousness for these types of offences. 
      
       
     69 The subjective material before the court revealed that the applicant had grown up in a dysfunctional Samoan family where there was an extensive history of alcohol and drug abuse. His mother walked out on the family when the applicant was aged five years, leaving him without significant adult supervision. He achieved little at school, leaving at age fourteen, and has virtually no work experience. 
      
       
     70 The applicant has lived in a de facto relationship for some years and has a four year old son from that relationship. The applicant has abused narcotics since age fourteen, becoming an intravenous heroin user, spending about $200 per day on his habit. His crimes have been motivated by a desire to have money with which to acquire drugs. 
      
       
     71 Kirkham DCJ found that because of his youth, genuine contrition and regret, the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. For these reasons he provided, upon release, for an extended period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 
      
       
        
        
       The application of Henry 
       
     72 As I have indicated, it is not entirely clear how, if at all, the sentencing judge utilised the guideline judgment in Henry in the sentencing process. However, he did not consider the judgment relevant to the sentencing of the applicant’s brother, and, as he found that they each carried the same degree of criminality in relation to the relevant offences, it is likely that he ultimately decided that the Henry guidelines were not appropriate. The applicant submits that Kirkham DCJ should be understood to have determined that Henry should be distinguished having regard to the amount stolen, the degree of planning and the prior record of the offender. It is submitted that his Honour placed undue emphasis on these matters with the consequence that the sentence was unduly harsh, falling outside the sentence which the guideline would suggest to be appropriate. 
      
       
     73 There may be a question as to whether the “guideline judgment” in Henry can withstand challenge having regard to the decision of the High Court in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen (2001) HCA 64 in which judgment was delivered after the present appeal was argued. However, it is unnecessary to consider that question for I am of the opinion that this was not a case where it was appropriate to apply the guideline judgment. There are a number of relevant matters. The offence was committed without the use of a weapon although there was, nevertheless a real and significant threat of violence. The robbery was obviously planned and executed in a coordinated manner. Although the applicant was young he has a very poor criminal record and a large amount of money was taken. The applicant entered a plea of guilty but the Crown had a strong case and the value of the plea must accordingly be discounted. 
      
       
        
       The plea of guilty 
       
     74 The applicant submits that the sentencing judge erred because he did not indicate the extent, if at all, that the applicant was to receive some benefit for having pleaded guilty to the count on the indictment and admitting the further offence. It is submitted that his Honour should have spelt out the manner in which the plea of guilty was taken into account and what, if any, discount was allowed and the basis for that discount. 
      
       
     75 Kirkham DCJ adverted to the applicant’s guilty plea acknowledging that “as in Henry’s case, there was a plea of guilty.” However, he does not indicate how he has dealt with that plea in the ultimate sentence. 
      
       
     76 In R v Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, this Court considered the appropriate approach to sentencing offenders who have entered pleas of guilty. A sentencing judge is required to state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account and encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence. The requirement to state that a plea has been considered is designed to ensure that the sentencing judge considers the matter. The encouragement to quantification is, inter alia, designed to ensure that the benefits which flow to the criminal justice system from a plea are articulated with the intention that there be an identified incentive to others to take the same course. 
      
       
     77 In the present case, the reference by Kirkham DCJ, to the plea of guilty is sufficient to satisfy me that he considered that matter when imposing the sentence. Although it would have been preferable if he had proceeded to quantify the effect of that plea on the ultimate sentence, when the term imposed is considered, I do not believe that error is revealed. 
      
       
        
       Section 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       
     78 Kirkham DCJ dealt with the other robbery to be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by saying “in my view, applying the principle of totality to these two robberies the applicant will be sentenced upon the basis that his crimes display criminality in the mid range of seriousness for these types of offences.” His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentence without identifying the components of it, as they derived from each offence. It is submitted that by not articulating the various components comprising the sentence, his Honour was in error. 
      
       
     79 It is further submitted that the principles provided by the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 require that, if it be the case that an additional penalty is required to be imposed, then quantification of the additional penalty is required. His Honour is said to have erred by: 
      
       
        
       (i) Failing to consider and identify the appropriate sentencing in respect of the matter on indictment and the additional penalty imposed in respect of the matter taken into account; 
        
        
       (ii) Failing to consider and identify the discount attributable to the applicant adopting the procedure provided for by s 33 of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        1999; 
        
        
       (iii) Having separately considered the appropriate penalties, failing to correctly consider the issue of accumulation of any penalty and the application of the totality principle. 
        
       
     80 This Court has had occasion to consider the appropriate approach to sentencing when additional offences are taken into account. They are currently known as “Form 1 matters”, a reference to the form on which they are set out, and, although the relevant section has changed, and the appropriate legislation has evolved, the substantive provisions have remained the same. Recognising the utilitarian value of an offender asking for other matters to be dealt with and thereby avoiding the necessity for a further trial, this Court has been prepared to impose a lesser penalty in respect of the additional matters, than it would if they had been separately prosecuted. However, the extent of the reduction in penalty has been the subject of some disagreement. 
      
       
     81 The settled principles are: 
      
       
        
       (a) the penalty imposed when a matter is taken into account must not exceed the maximum penalty which the court could have imposed in respect of the primary offence; (s 33(3)). 
        
        
       (b) the sentence for the foundation offence should not be only slightly increased if the offences to be taken into account on the Form 1 are serious in their own right:  
       R v Barton 
        [2001] NSWCCA 63. 
        
        
       (c) the sentence to be imposed must reflect the totality of a person’s criminality:  
       R v Morgan 
        (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372;  
       R v Bavadra 
        (2000) 115 A Crim R 152 at 158, [2000] NSWCCA 292; 115 A Crim R 152 at 158. 
        
        
       (d) two important elements which must be reflected in the sentence imposed when additional matters are taken into account are the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution from serious offenders:  
       Barton 
       . 
        
        
       (e) the sentence must reflect the fact that the Form 1 procedure provides significant advantages to the administration of justice. These are savings similar to those when a plea of guilty is entered and the opportunity is provided “to clear the offender’s slate” allowing an enhanced prospect of rehabilitation:  
       Bavadra 
       . However, there has been some discussion by members of this Court with respect to the reduction to be allowed for these advantages. 
        
       
     82 In R v Harris [2001] NSWCCA 322, Simpson J suggested that there are differences in the approach her Honour took to determining the benefit to be allowed to an offender who adopted the Form 1 procedure and that of some other members of this Court. In R v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5, 118 A Crim R 131, her Honour expressed the view that an offender who “adopts the procedure is entitled to expect an additional penalty significantly less than had separate charges been presented.” Her Honour added: 
      
       
        
         
         “If that were not so then the section would provide no incentive for the use of the procedure, which is administratively convenient both to the prosecution and to the courts and must therefore be implemented in such a way as to afford benefit to an offender.” 
         
        
       
     83 In R v Dawson, [2000] NSWCCA 399, Hulme J, with whom Barr J agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “However, subject to the limits imposed by s 21 itself, (now replaced by s 33 of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          1999) it seems to me that there is no basis in either the statute or logic to justify a general approach of treating matters taken into account as thereby meriting a lower penalty than had they been the subject of specific charge. If the practice of sentencing courts is as Mr Byrne asserts, it is in my view, wrong.” 
         
        
       
     84 In my opinion the approach which should be taken to the sentence to be imposed when additional matters are taken into account, must reflect the elements which I have previously identified. However, because the procedure may often allow matters to be finalised, which have not been investigated or, where an investigation has failed, I am of the view that the penalty imposed must, depending on the circumstances of the individual case, reflect this element of the utilitarian benefit in the offender adopting the procedure. This element requires a greater leniency of sentence than might otherwise have been imposed if the matters had been investigated and charges brought which result in a guilty plea. Accordingly, there may be cases where a significant reduction on this account is appropriate but this will not always be the case. 
      
       
     85 An unusual feature of the present case is that although the applicant was indicted with respect to the National Australia Bank robbery, he was not, with respect to the Westpac robbery, although his brother was indicted for the Westpac robbery but not the National Bank robbery. As a consequence there could have been no utilitarian benefit arising from the avoidance of an investigation. It follows that there is little to distinguish this case from the situation where a plea has been entered to a specific charge. 
      
       
     86 It was pointed out by Simpson J in Harris that it has not been the practice in sentencing where additional offences are taken into account to identify any increase in the sentence imposed by reason of the additional matters. Her Honour, although not determining the matter, expressed the view that because lack of quantification of any increase may leave the sentencing process unclear, “it would be appropriate to reconsider the approach taken to sentencing in these circumstances.” See para 32. 
      
       
     87 In Pearce, the High Court stated that when sentencing an offender for multiple offences it is necessary for the judge to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence as well as issues of totality. Explaining the need for this approach, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in their joint judgment said, at 624: 
      
       
        
         
         “Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision [cf House v King (1936) 55 CLR 499]. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process. 
         
        
        
         
         Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. [See Crimes Act, s 444(2) and (3); Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), s 9, see also Sentencing Act 1991 (Vict), s 16]. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences [R v Lomax [1998] 1 VR 551 at 564 per Ormiston JA].” 
         
        
       
     88 There are of course, significant differences between the circumstances considered in Pearce and the exercise of the discretion pursuant s 33(3). Under s 33(3), a sentencing judge is imposing a sentence in relation to the principal offence and although required to take the further offence into account, and impose an additional penalty, no separate penalty is imposed. Indeed, s 34(1) provides that a separate penalty may not be imposed. Accordingly no question of accumulation or concurrence will arise although problems of disparity between co-offenders could arise. 
      
       
     89 In my opinion, the approach tentatively supported by Simpson J, should be encouraged by this Court, but I do not believe that a failure to identify each element should constitute appellable error. The same approach as that which has been adopted in relation to a plea of guilty should be followed when further offences are taken into account: (see Thompson at 419). 
      
       
     90 Sentencing judges should endeavour to articulate the component of the sentence which relates to the original offence and that which relates to the other matters. 
      
       
        
       Was the sentence excessive? 
       
     91 It is finally necessary to consider whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Having regard to the serious nature of the offence, which included the threat of violence, the large amount stolen, and the fact that the robbery occurred in company, a significant prison sentence was appropriate. Although the applicant is a relatively young person, his criminal history demands a sentence at the higher end of the appropriate range. 
      
       
     92 In my opinion, a sentence of six years discounted by fifteen percent for the plea of guilty would have been well within the appropriate range for this offence. The plea had utilitarian benefit although the case against the applicant was strong. 
      
       
     93 The additional matter was also objectively serious and standing alone would have deserved a similar sentence in the event of a plea of guilty. In these circumstances a total prison term of six years and six months was in my view low. Accordingly, I am satisfied that no error has occurred. 
      
       
     94 For these reasons I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

      Judgment 
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Coolahan DCJ at the Newcastle District Court on 6 June 2001. The sentence which was imposed, for an offence of supplying methylamphetamine on an ongoing basis, contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, taking into account, on a Form 1, a charge of possession of sixty-two grams of cannabis, was one of imprisonment for five years, with a non-parole period of three years.2 The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in two respects. First, it was put that he misdirected himself as a matter of law when observing that the applicant: 
      
       
        
         
         ""does not have a lengthy criminal history but of significance is a conviction in 1994 for supply of a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. In my view not only does his record not assist him because of that matter, but the commission of this offence is made more serious or at least the matter is aggravated by the prior offence of a similar nature."" 
         
        
       
     3 Whilst it was accepted that his prior record had a relevance for several aspects of sentencing, it was not, so the submission went, a matter which aggravated or made more serious the offence for which the applicant stood for sentence.4 Secondly, it was submitted that irrespective of this consideration, the sentence fell outside a legitimate range of sentencing discretion and was manifestly excessive. To each of these grounds I will return after noting the relevant facts.THE FACTS5 The offences involved the supply of methylamphetamine to an undercover police officer on five occasions between 16 October 2000 and 25 October 2000. On three of those occasions the quantity supplied was one-half of a gram. For each of those deals the applicant received $50. The fourth and fifth deals each involved a quantity of seven grams for which the price on each occasion was $300. The sales were made at The Mad Mile BP Service Station, Cessnock, of which the applicant was the proprietor. 6 The applicant was arrested at his home behind the service station on 9 November 2000. A search of the premises failed to locate any methylamphetamine but it did turn up the cannabis previously mentioned, as well as some of the indicia of the drug trade comprising plastic bags and scales. 7 Although the applicant declined to participate in an interview with police, he disclosed during the sentencing proceedings that: (a) he had been selling methylamphetamine from the service station for some time, although he had less than 20 customers; 
      
       
     (b) he had engaged in this activity because the business was not making much money to the point of being unviable; 
      
       
     (c) he had long-standing problems with alcohol, had used cannabis over the years and had begun to use methylamphetamine over the preceding 12 months because of the long hours that he was putting into the business; 
      
       
     (d) the service station had a reputation as an outlet for methylamphetamine before he had taken over the business; 
      
       
     (e) he had in fact ceased the supply of methylamphetamine between the date of the last sale to an undercover officer and the time of the police search because his de facto partner had insisted that he do so at penalty otherwise of ending their relationship;  
      
       
     (f) he had voluntarily given up the use of drugs himself from the time of his arrest and he did not intend to re-offend; and  
      
       
     (g) he had lost the service station and associated business because of the offence and he had consequently fallen into debt. 8 His Honour made it clear that by and large he accepted the applicant's evidence, including the fact that he had voluntarily given up the supply of drugs from the service station. He also accepted that the plea had been entered at the first available opportunity and that the applicant was entitled accordingly to a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea although that, his Honour said, should be towards the lower end of the scale. Special circumstances were found referable to the fact that the applicant was aged forty-seven years and that this would be his first experience of full-time custody.9 I see no reason to depart from any of those findings. Each appears to be well and truly open upon the evidence. In particular, I do not think it appropriate, as the Crown suggested, to place some qualification upon the evidence from the applicant that he intended to give up the supply of drugs. This Court is not a court of factual review, and I see no reason to find fault in the fact finding process in that regard.10 In the light of the summary, I return to the grounds of appeal.CIRCUMSTANCES OF AGGRAVATION11 As Grove J, with whom I agreed, made clear in R v Groat (2001) NSWCCA 452, the fact of a prior conviction 
      
       
        
         
         ""can never, unless specifically legislated for, be used in a sentencing process as an aggravated feature."" 
         
        
        
       
     12 His Honour additionally observed: 
      
       
        
         
         ""An aggravated feature relates to something which makes the instant conduct more serious."" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     13 The objective criminality involved in any given offence needs to be weighed in the light of the facts which gave rise to it. Reference to earlier offences for which an offender has already been punished as a matter of aggravation potentially offends against the double jeopardy principle. 14 Similarly, reference to other uncharged offences, as a circumstance of aggravation, risks offending against the principles established in Regina v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. As Gummow J additionally observed in R v Ryan (2001) 75 ALJR 815 at para 67, bad prior character cannot operate in aggravation of sentence. 15 These considerations do, however, have a relevance for sentencing in relation to questions whether the offence before the Court was one that was or was not out of character, whether the applicant was or was not displaying a continued attitude of disobedience to the law and whether he had or did not have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 16 While it may be that his Honour had these considerations in mind and expressed himself inappropriately, it seems to me that error has been shown on the face of the record so that leave to appeal should be granted.SENTENCE MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE17 It is next necessary to consider, irrespective of any error disclosed so far, whether the case was one where some sentence other than that imposed was warranted in law and should have been passed (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 18 The offence was serious having regard to the maximum available sentence of twenty years imprisonment and to the policy reasons which gave rise to its creation. 19 The present instance was one of the genus expressed in R v Smiroldo (2000) NSWCCA 120, involving small deals equivalent to street deals. The gravity of the wrongdoing, in such a case, arises from the circumstance that the applicant, here a mature person, was deliberately involved in the business of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine from premises which he had known to be a drug outlet. 20 The mere quantity involved in each deal, in those circumstances, is not necessarily a governing consideration for determining the degree of objective criminality involved (see Smiraldo paras 15-16). 21 Moreover, the present applicant was obviously not particularly discriminatory or troubled about adding to his customer base, so far as he was prepared to make sales to the undercover officer who had not dealt with him previously. 22 Reference was made to the Judicial Commission's statistics as well as to the decisions of this Court in Regina v Smiroldo; R v Hoon and Pouoa (2000) NSWCCA 137; Regina v Tipler (2000) NSWCCA 382; Regina v Thompson (2000) NSWCCA 362; Regina v Carter (2000) NSWCCA 490; Regina v Bacon (2000) NSWCCA 549; Regina v Huang and Lin (2001) NSWCCA 76; Regina v Khaled (2001) NSWCCA 169; Regina v Nuth (2001) NSWCCA 318 and Regina v Groat by way of support for the proposition that the sentence fell outside the proper range.23 Reference to the Judicial Commission statistics is of limited utility, having regard to the fact that the relevant population of cases involved, in this instance, is limited and also to the inevitable variations which arise in objective and subjective circumstances which can be glossed over in a bare statistical analysis (see Regina v Tannous NSWCCA 18 June 1997 and Regina v Bloomfield NSWCCA 15 July 1998). 24 Moreover, there is the consideration noted by Grove J in Regina v Hayes (2001) NSWCCA 410 that: 
      
       
        
         
         ""there is a misconception that the upper limit of the range of sentence is that of the statistical publications of sentence information by the Judicial Commission. The upper limit of sentence is in fact the maximum set by Parliament. If the upper limit of the statistical range is treated as reserved for the worst case or the worst offender, then persistent selection of sentences for others within that range will inevitably reduce the upper figure. This is not a matter of jurisprudence but a matter of arithmetic."" 
         
        
       
      
      
       
     25 With that observation, I express my wholehearted agreement. 26 Reference to specific cases can provide some guidance, subject again to variations in the relevant objective and subjective circumstances involved, and also to the fact that some of the cases drawn to our attention involved the substance heroin rather than methylamphetamine.27 In this regard our attention was specifically drawn to the case of Huang and Lin which appears to be the only case where a higher sentence was imposed. It was a more serious case involving substantial quantities of heroin. We were also invited to pay particular regard to Bacon, where there was a similarity to the present case in that the offender there had also voluntarily ceased the business of supply.28 Ultimately, however, the question becomes one of weighing the objective criminality of the offender, which I regard in this case to be substantial, as well as his subjective circumstances, in the context of the legislative policy evident for the offence charged. 29 The reason why the applicant had descended into criminality provides no excuse whatsoever. As his Honour pointed out, financial problems do not justify resorting to dealing in drugs. 30 Moreover, he had a prior record, the existence of which disentitled him to much in the way of leniency in that it involved offences of assault, possession of prohibited drug and resist arrest for which he had been fined; an offence of supply prohibited drug, for which he had received eighteen months periodic detention; some serious assault offences and an offence of malicious damage (property), for which he had received a good behaviour bond for twelve months, and which was current at the time of the present offence. 31 That latter circumstance was a matter which weighed unfavourably for the applicant for the reasons noted in Regina v Daridis NSWCCA 18 December 1986, Regina v McMahon NSWCCA 4 April 1996 and Regina v Tran (1990) NSWCCA 109. 32 Additionally, as I have observed, another drug offence was taken into account on a Form I, that being a matter which needed also to be reflected in the sentence for the reasons outlined in Regina v Barton (2001) NSWCCA 63. 33 In these circumstances, I am satisfied that a sentence involving full-time imprisonment was called for and that it should have been a substantial sentence which reflected the elements of retribution and personal deterrence for an offender who had a prior conviction for the supply of drugs, and which also reflected the important element of general deterrence. 34 In addition, there were the circumstances that I have mentioned, that he was subject to a bond at the time of the offence and that a second drug offence had to be taken into account. On the other hand, there is the fact of the early plea and the fact that he had voluntarily ceased the business of supply, as well as the fact that he had demonstrated contrition, both positively and through his early plea. 35 In all of the circumstances outlined, I am of the view that the sentence was excessive to a degree sufficient to justify intervention, but only to a limited degree.36 I would grant leave to appeal, quash the sentence below and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for four years, to commence on 9 November 2000 and to expire on 8 November 2004. 37 For the reasons identified by his Honour, I am similarly persuaded that special circumstances exist and I will impose a non-parole period of two years and four months, similarly to date from 9 November 2000 and to expire on 8 March 2003.38 SPERLING J: I agree.39 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I proposed.

       REGINA v NIKOLITSA TOGIAS 
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The facts and issues are set out in the judgment of Grove J which I have read in draft. The Respondent to this Crown appeal acted as a courier for a substantial quantity of the narcotic known as ecstasy. The amount of almost one kilogram was double the commercial quantity. The Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of importation pursuant to s233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and was convicted and sentenced accordingly. 
      
       
      Whether Sentence Manifestly Inadequate 
     2 In the present case a substantial custodial sentence was called for, unless the case was exceptional. There was a plea of guilty and the subjective circumstances advanced on the part of the Respondent were of moderate strength. The consideration of particular force was the fact that at the time of sentence the Respondent had recently given birth to a child. 
     3 I agree with Grove J that the sentence of three years was a manifestly inadequate sentence. The Crown presented to the Court a detailed schedule of sentences for ecstasy and other mid-range narcotics. The Respondent did not challenge the proposition that the schedule was reasonably representative of sentencing practice. Putting aside the occasional exceptional case of a very large shipment or substantial assistance to authorities, the schedule suggests a sentencing range for persons low in the hierarchy of five to nine years, with non-parole periods from three to six years. The lower end of the range was applicable to traffickable quantities, often quite small amounts. 
     4 By s16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), a court sentencing for a Commonwealth offence “must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. A sentence of three years failed to comply with this mandatory requirement. 
     5 Furthermore, the order suspending the sentence could not be justified on the basis that the Respondent would be separated from her child for an unknown period. His Honour could, and should, have deferred sentencing until the Respondent had been assessed, so that the Court knew whether or not there would be any separation. (For a NSW offence the order would be made under s11(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). A suspended sentence was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case. 
     6 I agree with Grove J that his Honour should have deferred sentencing pending an assessment. The High Court decision in R v Griffiths (1977) 137 CLR 293 is often cited as authority for the existence of power to proceed by way of a common law bond – which came to be called a “Griffiths” remand – permitting behavioural assessment of an offender. However, the Court’s power to defer sentencing is not confined to such a circumstance. Subject to any statutory requirement, a Court may defer sentencing for any proper purpose affecting the sentencing task. (See e.g. Griffiths at 321-323, 335, 338-339.) 
     7 In an appropriate case, the inability of the prison authorities to provide for detention in a humane manner will justify a court refusing to impose a custodial sentence. That was not shown to be the case here. His Honour was correct to conclude that the evidence from the Department of Corrective Services revealed a process that involved unacceptable delays so that the probable separation of mother and baby could be regarded as inhumane. However, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that, by deferring the sentencing task, he may have been able to ensure that, with the co-operation of the authorities and subject to a positive assessment, there would be no such separation. In view of the seriousness of the offence, his Honour erred in failing to take that course. 
     8 By s16A(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth), the court must take into account a list of matters being such of the matters “as are relevant and known to the court”. As a joint judgment of this Court of Fitzgerald JA, Abadee and Barr JJ said in R v Capper [2000] NSWCCA 63 at [8]: 
      
       
       “Some of the matters specified in subs 16A(2) would, in appropriate circumstances, favour leniency, while others point in the opposite direction. … 
       
       
       The diversity of the specified factors and the tension between them emphasise the broad discretionary nature of the sentencing process.” 
       
     9 Of particular relevance in the present case is s16A(2)(p) which provides, as one of the list of matters: 
      
       
       “the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.” 
       
     10 It is of some significance that the Parliament has identified this matter in terms of a “probable effect”, not merely a “possible effect”. 
     11 In the present case, there was virtually no evidence before the court about the relevant circumstances. There was some suggestion in the materials before the court of a supportive relationship from the Respondent’s mother and, it appears, that the father of the child was also supportive. None of this is to detract from the significance, particularly in the case of a baby, of a mother child relationship. However, evidence which would assist the court in determining the “probable effect” of the various sentencing options available to the court was available only to the Respondent 
     12 The evidence actually adduced was limited to a psychologist who gave evidence as to the strength and significance of the bond between mother and child, particularly in the early months. She described the effect of taking a child away from a mother while breastfeeding within the first three months as “absolutely traumatic”. The expert witness also gave evidence as to the effects of separation from the mother after a three month period, which was the pertinent evidence in the light of the fact that, as at the date of sentence, the child was about three months old. I found this evidence somewhat difficult to understand. 
     13 His Honour approached the sentencing exercise on the basis that hardship to a child had to be classified as “exceptional” before it could be given substantial weight for the purposes of s16A(2)(p). Counsel for both the Appellant and the Respondent in this appeal accepted that his Honour was correct.  
     14 The necessity for such an “exceptional” effect has long been accepted for sentencing at common law. (See eg R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 per Gleeson CJ at 516-517).  
     15 The South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal held that legislation in that State to the same effect as s16A(2)(p) did not affect the application of the common law principle (R v Adami (1989) 51 SASR 229). The Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal came to the same conclusion with respect to s16A(2)(p) (R v Sinclair (1990) 51 A Crim R 418 esp at 430-431). This was also the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in Victoria (R v Matthews (1996) 130 FLR 230 at 233). (See also R v Carmody (1998) 100 A Crim R 41 at 45). 
     16 Courts of Criminal Appeal in three States have interpreted s16A(2)(p) as not altering the common law. Exceptional hardship is required. It is important that Courts of Criminal Appeal adopt the same approach to the interpretation of national legislation. Some comments by Dunford J appear to express a different view (R v Caradonna [2000] NSWCCA 398 at [25]). However Gleeson CJ referred to the South Australian and Western Australian decisions without disapproval in Edwards supra at 517. Subsequently to Caradonna, where he had agreed with Dunford J, Wood CJ at CL affirmed the authority of the earlier cases (R v Ceissman [2001] NSWCCA 73 at [36]). 
     17 If there is to be any change in this position, and that was not put in this case even on a formal basis, only the High Court can effect it. 
      
       
      Relationship between Commonwealth Law and New South Wales Law 
     18 By ss6 and 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), the court is empowered to make orders by way of periodic detention or home detention, as an alternative to full time detention in the case of New South Wales offences. Those sections relevantly provide: 
      
       
       “6(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 3 years may make a periodic detention order directing that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention.” 
       
       
        “7(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 18 months may make a home detention order directing that the sentence be served by way of home detention.” 
       
     19 These sentencing options are available for Commonwealth offences by force of s20AB(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth) which provides: 
      
       
       “Where under the law of a participating State or a participating Territory a court is empowered in particular cases to pass a sentence or make an order known as a community service order, a work order, a sentence of periodic detention, an attendance centre order, a sentence of weekend detention or an attendance order, or to pass or make a similar sentence or order or a sentence or order that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, in respect of a State or Territory offender, such a sentence or order may in corresponding cases be passed or made by that court or any federal court in respect of a person convicted before that first mentioned court, or before that federal court in that State or Territory, of a federal offence.” 
       
     20 The section expressly refers to “a sentence of periodic detention”. Regulation 6(g) of the Crimes Regulations 1990 (Cth), as amended, prescribes a home detention order made under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), for the purposes of s20AB of the Crimes Act (Cth). A home detention order may not be made with respect to some drug offences. This does not, however, include offences under s233B of the Customs Act (Cth). 
     21 Mr Odgers SC, who appeared for the Respondent in this Court, submitted that the restriction contained in the opening words of each of ss6(1) and 7(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW), requiring that a court has “sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than” three years or eighteen months, in the cases of periodic detention and home detention respectively, does not apply to the orders of that character with respect to Commonwealth offences. Mr Odgers SC relied on s20AB(1A) of the Crimes Act (Cth), which provides: 
      
       
       “Where the law of a participating State or a participating Territory requires that before passing a sentence, or making an order, of the kind referred to in subsection (1) a court must first pass another sentence or make another order (whether or not that other sentence or other order is suspended upon the making of the first-mentioned sentence or order), then, a court is not required, before passing or making that first- mentioned sentence or order in respect of a person convicted by that court for a federal offence, to pass that other sentence or make that other order.” 
       
     22 The issue is whether the words “[a] court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than” a period, satisfy the description found in s20AB(1A) of “a court must first pass another sentence”. 
     23 Grove J has referred to par 125 of the Report of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Sentencing, being ALRC 44 which led to the insertion of s20AB(1A). The Commission’s concern was to ensure that each sentencing option would be available for consideration on its own merits. It referred to a situation in which a community service order could only be made if the Court had found that the offender should be imprisoned. This is reflected in the terms of s20AB(1A) by the use of the word “requires” with reference to “must first pass another sentence”, as a description of the relevant State or Territory law. 
     24 In my opinion, the introductory words of ss6 and 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (NSW) are not a ‘requirement’ of the character referred to in s20AB(1A). As a matter of substance, these introductory words are negative rather than positive in effect. Insofar as there is a ‘requirement’ it is that the Court must not have sentenced an offender to imprisonment for more than three years or eighteen months, respectively. This is not in my opinion a ‘requirement’ to the effect that the court “must first pass another sentence” within the meaning of s20AB(1A). Rather, it is a ‘requirement’ that the court must not first pass another sentence. I do not believe that s20AB(1A) should be read as if the words “requires that a court must first pass another sentence” encompass both a negative and positive formulation. Accordingly, I agree with Grove J that the submission made on the part of the Respondent in this regard should be rejected. 
      
       
      Relevance of an International Convention 
     25 The Respondent invoked article 9.1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) which states: 
      
       
       “State Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. …” 
       
     26 Article 9.4 makes reference to “imprisonment” as one of the circumstances in which the separation of a child can occur. It provides: 
      
       
       “Where such separation results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child. …” 
       
     27 Notwithstanding this reference to “imprisonment”, it is not clear to me how a “separation” by way of imprisonment can ever be determined to be “for the best interests of the child” save where there has been a crime of child abuse.  
     28 The Respondent did not invoke article 3.1 of the Convention which provides: 
      
       
       “In all actions concerning children whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.” 
       
     29 Nor did the Respondent invoke the similar common law principle, to which Gaudron J referred in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1994-1995) 183 CLR 273 at 304. 
     30 It was submitted that article 9 was a “particularly relevant matter”, in support of the submission that it was open to his Honour to find the circumstances of the present case to be “exceptional”, in the sense that that word is used in the line of authorities concerning the impact of a sentence upon an offender’s family. In response to questioning from the Court, it was submitted that the Convention was “relevant to a sentencing discretion”. 
     31 The jurisprudential basis upon which the asserted “relevance” could be supported, was not further elucidated. The Court was not referred to the line of authority in the High Court on the use to be made in Australian law of international legal instruments. The Court was not referred to any authority in which a court anywhere in the world has applied treaty obligations in the sentencing process. 
     32 Some support for such use of article 9 was said to arise from the coincidence that the same word “exceptional” also appears in the pre-Convention United Nations General Assembly resolution, entitled Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959, which relevantly included in its “Principle 6”: 
      
       
       “… a child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother.” 
       
      How this is pertinent, is not clear to me. 
       
     33 International treaties and conventions to which Australia is a party, but which have not been incorporated in Australian law, have been invoked in Australian legal reasoning. Such international obligations: 
     · Are an appropriate influence on the development of the common law (Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1991-1992) 175 CLR 1 at 42 per Brennan J; Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 360 per Toohey J; 372-3 per Gaudron J; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh per Mason CJ and Deane J). 
     · May be used to resolve an ambiguity in a statute (Polites v The Commonwealth (1945) 70 CLR 60 at 68-69 per Latham CJ, 77 per Dixon J, 80-81 per Williams J; Teoh supra at 287 per Mason CJ and Deane J; Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration  (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 38 per Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ; Kartinyeri v The Commonwealth (1998) 195 CLR 337 at [97] per Gummow and Hayne JJ). 
     · May create a legitimate expectation about executive decision making (Teoh supra especially at 291 per Mason CJ and Deane J). 
     34 The Respondents did not invoke any of these circumstances. Indeed, I would have thought that the provisions of the Convention would support an argument against requiring “exceptionality” as a test for s16A(2)(p), rather than, as propounded by the Respondent, as reinforcing the application of such a test. 
     35 The issue has arisen, so far as I have been able to determine, in Australia on three occasions before a single judge of a state supreme court. Perry J has treated the Convention as a relevant consideration in the context of s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and also in the context of the similar provision in South Australian legislation. (See Walsh v Department of Social Security (1996) 67 SASR 143 at 146; Bates v Police (1997) 70 SASR 66 at 70.) Bleby J, without reference to the earlier decisions of Perry J, rejected the proposition that treaty obligations can be invoked in this manner (R v Smith (1998) 98 A Crim R 442 at 448). 
     36 Difficult questions arise. (See eg Baker v Canada (1999) 174 DLR (4th) 193 at [69]-[70] and cf [78]-[81]; Rajan v Minister of Immigration [1996] 3 NZLR 543 at 550-552.) The Court has not received the kind of assistance required for the determination, for the first time, of the important principles involved. It is not appropriate to determine these matters on this occasion. 
     37 Woods DCJ made a finding of exceptional circumstances. He did not invoke article 9 of the Convention. It is unnecessary for this Court to do so in the light of the orders proposed by Grove J, with which I agree. I also agree that it would not be appropriate for Woods DCJ to rehear the matter.38 GROVE J: On 7 October 1999 the respondent, aged twenty one, arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport from Bali, Indonesia. She was travelling alone. A customs officer detected a bulky item around her waist and, questioned about its nature she said “No, I don’t know. You know that German guy, you know he raped me. He put this on.” Examination disclosed that she was carrying 8,282 tablets later determined to be a drug commonly referred to as ecstasy. The purity was rated at 44.7% resulting in 967.5 grams of methylene dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). She was charged with importing not less than the commercial quantity of prohibited import and after one week in custody she was released to bail. 
     39 On 31 March 2000 the respondent pleaded guilty before a magistrate and was committed for sentence to the District Court pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act 1902. On 4 September 2000 she appeared before Woods DCJ where counsel applied for remand until after she was delivered of an expected child. His Honour expressed the view that the application was appropriate. The Crown Prosecutor applied to have noted that the fact of pregnancy was not disputed but that the application for adjournment was opposed. It was granted and the sentence hearing adjourned to 2 March 2001. At the adjourned hearing his Honour found that the child had been born on 7 January 2001. He expressed a requirement that he be satisfied that (in the event of a custodial sentence being imposed) there was “some mechanism by which there can be a continuity of contact between the mother and the child” and sought that evidence be obtained from an appropriate source, in particular the Department of Corrective Services. 
     40 On 30 March 2001 Mr Kailis the acting program manager at Mulawa Corrective Centre and Ms Loy (transcribed at times as Ms Lloyd or Ms Morely) the coordinator of the mothers and childrens program for the department and Ms Warren, a psychologist, one of whose specialties was interaction of young children with their mothers, gave evidence. The learned judge sentenced the respondent to three years imprisonment to date from that day but ordered her release forthwith upon giving security by entering a recognizance herself in the sum of $5,000 to be of good behaviour for three years. 
     41 On 23 April 2001 the Director of Public Prosecutions lodged this appeal contending that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     42 His Honour’s remarks on sentence were very much focussed upon his concerns about the welfare of the child and maternal contact. He appears to have accepted that the respondent had succumbed to the blandishments of a German whom she met in Bali and consequently was contacted by some Asian people who supplied her with the contraband and the means of its transport. He found that her role in the importation was that of a courier. After arrest the respondent exercised her right, on the advice of her solicitor, to decline to be interviewed. However on 22 March 2000 shortly before entry of her plea of guilty in the Local Court, she supplied a statement to the Australian Federal Police upon which his Honour’s findings seem to be based. No mention was made of rape in this statement but she described a German named Stefan who proposed that she take some drugs into Australia. The “plan” was foolproof and someone would meet her “on the other side” (of Australian customs) to whom she should deliver the drugs for which she would receive in exchange $5,000. She never saw Stefan again after making this arrangement. She was visited in her hotel by Asian men. She expressed reluctance about continuing but was persuaded that the power of a “magic ring” supplied by one of them to her would keep her “safe”. During the flight to Australia she vacillated about abandoning the drug on the aircraft and decided not to because the “collector” might have been watching her from somewhere on the plane. One of the Asian males was known to her as Wawan. On the issue of assistance, the content of the statement was assessed as of very minimal value to the Australian Federal Police. The respondent’s assertions were not supported by testimony. 
     43 Aside from the circumstances pertaining to the newborn infant, the respondent presented an additional significant subjective case. She had no prior conviction. A number of favourable testimonials were presented. She was undertaking and in fact completed a course through which she attained tertiary qualifications in biotechnology. 
     44 Woods DCJ expressly found that “fears which she expresses of sexual molestation are, in her case, very real” and he based this explicitly on his acceptance of “the inference” that Dovey J drew. This reference should be explained. The respondent did not give evidence and hence did not testify to these fears. Mention of her fears (of molestation if in custody) appears in a report from a psychiatrist Dr Roberts whom she saw on several occasions between October 1999 and 12 July 2000 and whose first report is dated 18 July 2000. Attached to this report is the transcript of a judgment of Dovey J in proceedings between the respondent’s parents in 1984. Contained therein is a comment that the wife had suspended access of the husband because of an allegation of sexual interference with “one or other or both of the two children of the marriage” in respect of which allegation the judge (Dovey J) said that he had “grave suspicion” but he made no positive finding. The respondent was one of the children referred to.  
     45 Dr Roberts reported that the respondent adverted to sexual behaviour between herself and her father but that she had “no recollection that this occurred”. 
     46 The respondent informed a probation and parole officer who prepared a report in July 2000 that the holiday to Bali was encouraged by her mother but made possible by her father who was an airline employee and able to assist with the ticket. That does not suggest a likely history of misconduct by father towards daughter. She told Dr Roberts that the cost was $100 and that she had been to Bali in all on three occasions where she “sunbakes and buys clothes”. Her history of sexual assault to the probation and parole officer was that, a few days after her eighteenth birthday, an uncle tried to sexually assault her but she was eventually able to push him away. 
     47 No express challenge to his Honour’s finding that the respondent’s fears were real was made but the material, upon analysis, would scarcely support it. 
     48 Senior counsel for the respondent sought to place particular weight on the respondent’s psychologically vulnerable nature with particular reference to “sexual abuse as a child” and he noted that recently before travelling to Bali she had attempted suicide. The latter is the subject of contradictory material as to whether it occurred three months or three years beforehand. Dr Roberts reports a history of suicide attempt three months prior to the journey to Bali “with 40 panadeine forte”. The probation and parole officer reported that she attempted to take her life consuming “a large number of pills” not long after the incident with the uncle shortly after her eighteenth birthday when she became depressed and unable to cope. 
     49 His Honour took into account the “psychological and personal circumstances” of the offender. He did not elaborate. If the remarks are referable to the subject matter of counsel’s submission, the evidence leaves the issue in obscurity. 
     50 In a written submission senior counsel for the respondent accepted the correctness of the recognition by his Honour that participation as a courier in the importation of a commercial quantity of ecstasy would “normally require a significant period of full time custody”. That statement is endorsed. 
     51 Few things are so widely promulgated, not only in Australia but many other parts of the world, that trafficking in illicit drugs will attract severe penalty. The respondent’s history to Dr Roberts was that she had herself “never tried” the use of any drugs. Her motive in doing what she did was purely financial gain. Her appreciation of the sinister aspects of her participation was plainly conveyed in her belated statement to police which included “Wawan explained how they were going to hide the drugs on me. He also told me to go the next day to buy a corset, which would be used to hide the drugs, which I did”. She did not check herself out of the hotel in Bali in response to a representation by the Asian males that they would finalise her hotel bill. Her statement of belief that, if she disposed of the tablets on the aircraft, the person waiting to collect them would “do something terrible” to her was unreferenced to anything said or done in Bali during her encounter with the promoters of the importation. 
     52 Unless there be some exceptional reason the sentence imposed accompanied by immediate release order must be categorized as inadequate, and to such an extent as to attract the intervention of this court and the imposition of an appropriate sentence. 
     53 Woods DCJ found exceptional reason and, after an historical reference which his Honour said demonstrated “tenderness of the law towards pregnancy and childbirth ……. on a continuing basis”, he concluded: 
      
       
        
        “………….. the law will generally be robust and take a view that imposition of a sentence of imprisonment almost inescapably can damage family relationships and have an impact on other persons. But the case of a child feeding at the breast, it seems to me, is special and exceptional and in taking into account s16A (of the Crimes act 1914) it calls for particular attention to subsection (2)(p). 
        
       
       
        
        In this case the misbehaviour (sic) certainly would normally call for a significant sentence of full time custody. Nevertheless, in the circumstances as I have described them, notwithstanding the best endeavours of those concerned with the administration of the women’s prison, a very grave and extraordinary impact would occur in relation to the infant if a full time sentence were imposed.” 
        
       
     54 It will be necessary to examine some detail of the circumstances of prison administration adverted to by his Honour but I should say at the outset that my reading of the evidence leads me to a conclusion which restrains me from joining in the compliment implicit in the expression “best endeavours”. 
     55 I should collate some details about the respondent’s situation. At the time she appeared for sentence the latest probation and parole report recorded that she resided with her mother, sister and seven week old daughter in the family home. She had been in a steady relationship for three years and intended to wed after “court matters have been resolved”. She and her partner were self employed selling “sports supplements to gymnasiums and health clubs” from which they derived their sole (unstated) income. Given the date of birth of the child, it can be inferred that she became pregnant about March 2000, that is to say some four to five months after being arrested and charged. 
     56 Not only, as already noted, did the respondent not avail herself of the opportunity to testify, neither did her partner or any member of her family. There is, of course, no obligation to call such evidence and adverse inference is not to be founded on its absence but neither can positive finding soundly arise. 
     57 His Honour was entitled to act upon material put before him by way of documents such as the probation report and the medical opinion, however there was no detectable evidential source for his central finding that the infant was currently being breastfed by the respondent. I am, of course, aware that in a busy sentencing court matters which are not in dispute are frequently advanced by counsel with some informality. However, in the present case where the circumstance that the infant was being breastfed was critical and central to the course which his Honour decided to adopt he ought to have insisted upon adequate proof either by evidence or formal agreement as to fact. 
     58 The assumption (of breastfeeding) had effect in the context of the evidence of the Corrective Service officers and Ms Warren. 
     59 His Honour had been provided with a letter (concerning a different person) to which there was attached a pamphlet detailing the mothers and childrens program of the Corrective Services Department but that document contained repeated emphases that there could be no guarantee of approval into the program and that the Commissioner would make the final decision taking into account “many variables”. The lastmentioned were not defined. Length of sentence was a suggested factor but how it was to be applied remained unclear. 
     60 I will summarize some matters emerging from the evidence of Mr Kailis and Ms Loy in a little more detail.  
     61 Jacaranda Cottages are part of a facility at Emu Plains Correctional Centre which can include a child and mother living together (at the centre) full time. Mr Kailis testified that there was no facility for a mother (and child) to go immediately into custody at Jacaranda Cottages. A mother under sentence would be received into Mulawa and after assessments (psychologist and drug and alcohol worker) would have her classification determined at a case management meeting. If not initially classified to category 2 it would normally take six months to achieve reduction from category 3 by review but perhaps three months in “extraordinary circumstances”. How long initial classification takes was left obscure but even on arrival at Emu Plains it would take around two months (in the main gaol) before Jacaranda Cottages were in prospect. Of course, in any event, even if all the assessments were favourable, ultimate decision had to await final exercise of discretionary power by the Commissioner. 
     62 Absent Jacaranda Cottages and approval of full time care, Mr Kailis stated that other “facilities” for women with children were visits on one day per week (10am – 2pm) between the mother and children only, and three visits per week of one and half hour duration on other days with family members at which the children could again be “brought along”. 
     63 Ms Loy commenced her evidence by “reiterating what Mr Kailis was saying”. I infer that she was present during his testimony. She then stated “that everything depends on the sentence” and added “it’s one year, it’s obviously easier to get them into Jacaranda Cottages. If it’s five, ten years, it’s obviously longer”. I regret that why the time it takes to assess and approve a mother for entry into the program should extend by reason of length of sentence to be served in the future is not obvious to me.  
     64 She added that “paperwork” could take six to eight weeks or longer and that sometimes it has taken four to six months for her to get “a baby with their mum for all sorts of reasons”. 
     65 Counsel had asked Ms Loy whether it was possible to have the child brought in (to prison) once a day and she replied that she “wouldn’t be doing that assessment”. However his Honour suggested that in practical terms one would not have a child being brought back and forth to prison and Ms Loy agreed although her answer “It’s not good for the child, and the carers, the carers are – the carers are able to come, you know, twice a day, or once a day. It’s not very practical” seems to focus mainly on the carers. The issue was not explored further. 
     66 I can understand a reluctance to impose a sentence of full time custody in the light of that evidence but his Honour was well equipped to take steps to remedy any perceived deficiency. It was erroneous, in my opinion, to fail to do so. A Court has power to adjourn the sentencing of an offender with or without conditions for a purpose affecting the exercise of sentencing discretion. Griffiths v the Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293. That authority confirmed the law in Australia as recognizing a power analogous to that of the then existent Court of Quarter Sessions in England articulated by Pickford J. in R v Spratling 1911 1 KB 77: 
      
       
        
        “It was not, and could not be, denied that that Court had power to sentence him at the time he was convicted. We think it equally clear that it had power to postpone sentence till a future day. It also had power to release him on bail on his own recognizances. To bind him over to appear for sentence when called upon is only to postpone sentence, and in the meanwhile release the prisoner on bail. This power has constantly been acted upon, and we see no reason to doubt that it exists, and that the jurisdiction to pass sentence still remains in the Court. We must not, however, be taken to decide that the Court can postpone sentence sine die against the will of the prisoner.” 
         
        
       
     67 Adjournment sine die is not contemplated but a limited delay to obtain useful information. What was required was firm evidence of what conditions would pertain in relation to this respondent and her child in the event that an order committing her to prison were to be made. The evidence tendered was limited to generalities. No attempt was made to obtain focussed information. It is possible that a response in particular terms may not be forthcoming from Corrective Services but such a situation would need to be taken into account if it arose. His Honour elected to proceed without knowing what the situation was in this regard. 
     68 The Court was taken by counsel to a collection of authorities to some of which I will now refer but none of them offers direct application to the present case. 
     69 In R v Stewart 1994 72 A Crim R 17 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia upheld sentences ranging up to twenty two months imprisonment upon a woman aged twenty five years who pleaded guilty to possessing quantities of cannabis and cannabis resin which she was deemed to have within intent to supply. At the time of sentence she had three children and was three months pregnant. In R v Carmody 1998 100 A Crim R 41, a thirty year old mother was sentenced to imprisonment for various offences including being knowingly concerned in the importation of a traffickable quantity of heroin. New material received by the Court of Appeal of Victoria indicated that her child was chronically prone to attacks of febrile convulsion and was particularly reliant on his mother’s care and comfort and would be likely to be appreciably disadvantaged by a separation from her. Although sentence was reduced from a higher level, a minimum term of eighteen months imprisonment was imposed by the appellate court.  
     70 In R v SLR 2001 116 A Crim R 150 a sentencing judge imposed sentences effectively confining the offender for minimum terms dating from 29 October 1999 until 28 August 2000. She was due to deliver a child in June 2000 and this was known when sentence was imposed on 29 October 1999. On appeal, the sentences were left undisturbed save the making of an order that after the birth of the expected child, the offender be transferred from a juvenile detention centre to an adult prison. It appears that the Court had been advised of the existence of the mothers and childrens program available in the latter but not the former. It does not appear that the Court was made aware of the administrative delays canvassed in the present case.  
     71 In R v Niga CCA NSW unreported 13 April 1994 a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence of three years imprisonment to be served by periodic detention was dismissed in the exercise of residual discretion, Kirby P (as he then was) remarking “we should leave this case with a clear indication that that sentence was not on the face of things adequate …………”. The offence was supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, however it was noted that findings were open that the offender was a relatively minor player in a significant drug dealing and was a single mother supporting two children. 
     72 In R v White [1999] NSWCCA 60 Simpson J (Smart AJ agreeing) observed that the applicant for leave to appeal, as at the date of release eligibility pursuant to sentence imposed in the District Court, would have a child “aged less than seven months. While one can appreciate that this may not be the ideal start in life, it does not, in my view, qualify under the Edwards ((1996) 90 A Crim R 510) test as ‘highly exceptional’ hardship”. The Court had been informed that the policy of the corrective services authorities was to permit children born in prison to remain with their mothers to the age of five years. 
     73 In R v Tiki CCA NSW unreported 24 August 1994 an offender became pregnant after arrest and charge for offences of dishonesty and gave birth to a child who was aged five and half months when the mother was committed to custody on 24 May 1994. Although sentence was reduced on appeal, full time custody was imposed for nine months commencing from the lastmentioned date. 
     74 In R v Luong [2000] NSWCCA 139 the offender was arrested when six months pregnant and charged with “deemed” supply of a commercial quantity of heroin. Her husband was a co-offender. The child had been taken away from the mother almost immediately after birth and the Court was informed that there was no provision for a woman in custody on remand to keep her baby. The offender had not been admitted to bail pending trial. Upon conviction she was sentenced to a minimum term of eight months imprisonment with an additional term of two years ten months and was thereby eligible for release about five weeks after the conclusion of the trial. She was in fact released about two weeks after her eligibility date. A Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence was dismissed, it being remarked that, as she had been at liberty for six and half months before the appeal was heard, the discretion of the Court would be invoked to dismiss the appeal in any event. 
     75 The Court of Appeal of Victoria suspended two years of a two and half year custodial term in R v La Mude [2001] VSCA 33 where a woman engaged in low level trafficking in amphetamines over a period of three months. However she had a background which the Court described as extraordinary in its misfortune. It was observed: 
      
       
        
        “Her father suicided when she was only six years old, and her paternal grandmother also suicided at some stage. The father of her first child suicided when that child was two years old. The son of the father of the applicant’s second child committed suicide when he was only 14, which was early in the course of that relationship, and that second partner, himself the subject of psychiatric care, committed suicide when the applicant brought the relationship to an end. In the course of the two relationships that led to the birth of her children, the applicant was subject to domestic violence, and, it was said on the plea, she was introduced to amphetamines by her third partner, a truck driver. Given her history, her counsel said her recourse to using drugs herself was scarcely surprising. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time of sentencing, the applicant’s son was 14 years old and her daughter eight. Both of them had then to be cared for by others, mainly her sister and her elderly mother, the latter with her own problems in that she was having to care for her own partner who was suffering from bowel cancer and had undergone a triple bypass operation in 1999. Further, according to the applicant’s sister on the plea, and indeed the psychologist in her report which went into evidence, the applicant’s eight year old daughter had developed significant anxiety about any separation from her mother, no doubt precipitated in part by her own father’s suicide which happened after the applicant was charged over the present offending.” 
        
       
     76 Nguyen v The Queen [2001] WASCA 72 concerned a woman (convicted with her husband at a joint trial) sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years seven months for possession of a traffickable amount of heroin imported contrary to the Customs Act and attempting to obtain possession of a traffickable quantity of the same drug. The first instance court had neither been given nor sought any information to enable compliance with s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1919, a provision which is applicable to the present case. It requires a sentencing court to take into account: 
      
       
        
        “(p) the probable effect of the sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the persons, family or dependants”. 
        
       
     77 The offender was responsible for four children aged sixteen, fourteen, twelve and six. Whilst she was in custody the eldest, a daughter, went to live with a boyfriend. Malcolm CJ observed: 
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, given that the appellant has already spent approximately seven months in prison and that the pre-sentence report demonstrates her acceptance of her responsibility for the children, I have reached the conclusion that, in the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, it would be in the best interests of the community in the longer term if she were conditionally released in order that she could be reunited with and care for her children. The alternative would seem to be for them to be taken into State care at State expense, in circumstances where the prospects of obtaining appropriate foster care for them appear to be remote.” 
        
       
     78 The Chief Justice referred to two decisions of the English Court of Criminal Appeal (R v Vaughan (1982) 4 Cr App R(S) 83, and R v Haleth (1982) 4 Cr App R(S) 178) in each of which sentence was varied to enable immediate release to care for sick child, however, he applied an ultimate test of requiring the case to fall within the category of exceptional within the meaning of the authorities dealing with the effect of imprisonment on those upon whom children are dependent for both emotional and physical wellbeing. 
     79 Wallwork J quoted with apparent approval: 
      
       
        
        “Professor Fox and Professor Freiberg in ‘Sentencing: State and Federal Law in Victoria’, 2nd ed(1999) state: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The circumstances may be regarded as exceptional if the imprisonment of a parent leaves a child without parental care, if a dependant will suffer  
          overwhelming 
           hardship because of the imprisonment of the offender, … Where all the features of the case point to a custodial sentence and there is evidence of  
          extreme 
           hardship, a court  
          may 
           take into account the  
          extraordinary 
           features of the case by suspending the sentence of imprisonment. Alternatively, the sentence may be shortened, or the non-parole period decreased.” 
          
         
        
       
     80 Provided the emphases (which I have added) are duly observed, I would endorse that excerpt from the text as correctly stating the law, applicable both at common law and by virtue of s16A (2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914. Such a conclusion is compatible with the principles underlying the cases which I have above referenced.  
     81 The respondent sought to support the sentence below by pointing to the very particular circumstances of the newborn child in the context of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. 
     82 A submission was made in these terms: 
      
       
        
        “A particularly relevant matter in this regard is the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is a party, which provides, in Article 9: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘1. States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The United Nations General Assembly, in proclaiming this right, among others, called upon Governments to recognize it and strive for its observance by legislative and other measures progressively taken in accordance with the following principle (among others): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Principle 6. … A child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother’. “ 
          
         
        
       
     83 Counsel for the Crown has pointed out: 
      
       
        
        “The respondent’s submissions actually recite part of Article 9 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (not the similarly titled and earlier Declaration) adopted by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1989 and which came into force on 2 September 1990. Australia signed the Convention on 22 August 1990 and it was ratified on 17 December 1990. On 22 December 1992, the Attorney-General made the Convention an international instrument within the meaning of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, replacing the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in the schedules to the Act.” 
        
       
     84 It is also notable that Article 9(4) recognizes that parents and children may be separated as a result of imprisonment of the former: 
      
       
        
        “Where such separation results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a request shall of itself entail no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned.” 
        
       
     85 The ratification of the declaration and its classification as an international instrument do not operate to impose it as binding Australian law. Its proclamation and discernible aims are available to be considered in a sentencing exercise and should be so considered in an appropriate case. The availability of these for consideration does not, in my view, extend or diminish the requirements of the common law and/or s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 in determining that exceptional circumstances must exist to attract amelioration of generally applicable sentence assessments. This appeal is not in my view an appropriate vehicle for elaboration upon the possible range of affect of international covenants such as the convention generally. 
     86 As some reference was made at the hearing of the appeal, I should mention the apparent situation in the United Kingdom. The Human Rights Act 1998 (Imp) incorporated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and a provision therein made it unlawful for a public authority (which includes a sentencing court) to act incompatibly with a convention right.  
     87 Article 8 is in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 
         
         (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” 
        
       
     88 The United Kingdom position is self-evidently not in its terms applicable in New South Wales but it is difficult to perceive that any different result would follow from adherence to the principle as stated by Fox and Freiberg which I have endorsed or the application of those terms. 
     89 I return to the present case.  
     90 In my opinion the objective seriousness of the importation of a commercial quantity of illicit drug inspired by promise of payment is such that a sentence of full time custody ought be imposed. That objective seriousness is not outweighed by subjective considerations including the existence of the dependent infant. The assessment of three years imprisonment for this offence was so far below the lower extreme of sound discretionary sentence as to manifest error. Suspending the entire term was a compounding error. 
     91 That opinion is amply supported by reference to cases, a schedule of which was supplied to the court. It will suffice to make reference to just some of these where the offender’s activity was broadly comparable with that of the respondent. In each of the cases that I will mention the drug was MDMA and the case was dealt with in this court. 
     92 DIZEL (23 Aug 96): Arrived from Bali with narcotics concealed internally. Weight of pure drug 41 grams. To receive $5,000. Plea of guilty but prior imprisonment in Japan for importing cocaine. Sentenced to ten years imprisonment with seven and half years non parole period. 
     93 BENAIS (26 July 99): Recruited in India but flew Holland to Australia with drugs concealed internally and in luggage. Weight of pure drug 61 grams. To be paid $7,000. Early guilty plea, prior good character, genuinely contrite, devoted to care and support of mother. Sentenced to six years imprisonment with three years non parole period. 
     94 OSBORNE (6 Nov 97): Arrived from UK with narcotics secreted on body. Weight of pure drug 240 grams. More than a “bare” courier but precise role unable to be better identified. Prior good character. Belated plea of guilty. Sentenced to eight years imprisonment with five and half years non parole period. 
     95 BUSHELL (7 Aug 98): Arrived from UK with narcotics in false bottom of suitcase. Pure MDMA plus analogue thereof totalling 332 grams. Plea of not guilty. No prior convictions but some assistance of slight value to authorities. Sentenced to seven years imprisonment with four years non parole period. 
     96 SPILLANE (16 Sept 99): Arrived from Singapore with narcotics concealed in luggage. Weight of pure drug 447 grams. Dealt with as courier. Record for dishonesty but no drug convictions. Plea of guilty. A chronic alcoholic. Sentenced to six years imprisonment with three and half years non parole period.  
     97 BOWERS (20 July 97): A courier arriving from London with narcotics attached to body. Weight of pure drug 719 grams. To be paid $10,000. Admitted guilt when detected by customs. Plea of guilty and no prior convictions. Sentenced to eight and half years imprisonment with four and half years non parole period. 
     98 BEHAR (14 Oct 98): Arrived from Fiji with narcotics concealed on body. Weight of pure drug 1,231 grams. Courier to be paid $18,000. No prior convictions and good rehabilitation prospects. Plea of guilty and 50 percent discount for future cooperation with authorities. Crown appeal and double jeopardy a factor. Sentenced to six years imprisonment with two and half years non parole period. 
     99 SOONIUS (29 May 98): Arrived from UK with narcotics concealed in suitcase. Weight of pure drug 3,340 grams. Courier for reward. No prior convictions and judgment impaired by depression. Some assistance to police. Plea of not guilty. Sentenced to nine years imprisonment with five and quarter years non parole period.  
     100 Counsel, as I have mentioned, recognized that a significant period of full time custody would “normally” be required. Submission was made concerning possible alternatives. Specifically periodic and home detention were canvassed. The latter, although it is not mentioned in s20AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914, we were informed by counsel for the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth that it had been made available for federal offenders by regulation. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the limitation to three years for periodic detention (and, by analogy, eighteen months for home detention) had been removed in the case of such sentences for federal offenders. 
     101 New South Wales is a participating State under s20AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 which provides: 
      
       
        
        “20AB (1) Where under the law of a participating State or a participating Territory a court is empowered in particular cases to pass a sentence or make an order known as a community service order, a work order, a sentence of periodic detention, an attendance centre order, a sentence of weekend detention or an attendance order, or to pass or make a similar sentence or order or a sentence or order that is prescribed for the purposes of this section, in respect of a State or Territory offender, such a sentence or order may in corresponding cases be passed or made by that court or any federal court in respect of a person convicted before that first-mentioned court, or before that federal court in that State or Territory, of a federal offence.” 
         
        
       
     102 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 does not authorize “a sentence of periodic detention”. Power is vested in these terms: 
      
       
        
        “6(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 3 years may make a periodic detention order directing that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention.” 
         
        
       
     103 Thus there is a two stage process, first the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment and second, an order for service by way of periodic detention. 
     104 By the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 1990 the Federal Parliament enacted s20AB (1A): 
      
       
        
        “20AB(1A) Where the law of a participating State or a participating Territory requires that before passing a sentence, or making an order, of the kind referred to in subsection(1) a court must first pass another sentence or make another order (whether or not that other sentence or other order is suspended upon the making of the first-mentioned sentence or order), then, a court is not required, before passing or making that first-mentioned sentence or order in respect of a person convicted by that court for a federal offence, to pass that other sentence or make that other order.” 
         
        
       
     105 It would appear that the provision was intended to meet circumstances mentioned by the Law Reform Commission in the context of concern that sentencing options be separately considered. The Commission had reported: 
      
       
        
        “However, two matters should be mentioned. First, there should be no link of community service orders to imprisonment. In the Australian Capital Territory that is already the case. However, a court in a State or in the Northern Territory sentencing a federal offender to a community service order should not have to find, as a pre-condition to imposing that sentence, that the offender should be imprisoned. In accordance with the Commission’s earlier recommendations, each sentencing option should be available for consideration separately on its own merits having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Community service orders may be appropriate where imprisonment is not. In addition, the Commission has recommended that imprisonment be eliminated as a sentence in some cases and it is inherent in that recommendation that all non-custodial options be available for consideration. The main role of community service orders (and other community based orders) is as a real substitute to prison. Secondly, the limits of community service orders should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth so far as federal offenders are concerned. For example, a federal offender in one jurisdiction should not face a maximum of 500 hours community service while a similar offender can be ordered to serve no more than 200 hours in another jurisdiction. The maximum limit for a community service order should be set at 500 hours, to be served over a period not exceeding two years. This figure, which is higher than any of the existing State or Territory limits, has been selected because of the Commission’s view that the severity of non-custodial options must be increased if they are to be used as a real alternative to imprisonment. This limit should also apply to Australian Capital Territory offenders.” ALRC Report No 44 par 125. 
         
        
       
     106 The concept was maintained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill which introduced s20AB(1A): 
      
       
        
        “Proposed subsection 20AB(1A) provides that a court sentencing a federal offender that wishes to make an alternative sentence (eg community service order) under subsection 20AB(1) is not required to apply State or Territory laws that require the making of another order before an alternative sentence can be imposed (for example, that a suspended prison term be imposed prior to the making of the alternative sentencing order). Where there is such a requirement, the alternative to imprisonment cannot be prescribed for the purposes of the section.” 
         
        
       
     107 I would reject the submission that s20AB(1A) has the effect of removing the restriction as to time. If approached in the way suggested an order, for example, “for service by way of periodic detention” need not be preceded by a sentence of imprisonment. Such an order, absent the sentence would be meaningless. The terms of s20AB(1A) remove requirements but this cannot and does not mean that a court may not proceed to impose effective sentences nor that the provisions vesting the power to impose them are rendered inapplicable. 
     108 The final matters are the orders which this court should make. The evidence before this court concerning the contact likely between mother and child is not advanced from the unsatisfactory state at which it stood in the court below and, as I have found, there ought there have been remand to enable proper and adequate investigation. I have also commented upon the lack of desirable detail as to the respondent’s circumstances, particularly concerning her fiancé, business, family arrangements and the like. Self evidently, with the passage of time things may change and the breastfeeding, which his Honour assumed, may have ceased or it should be proved if it has not. Most important is enquiry of Corrective Services for positive information about the contact of the respondent, if in custody, with her child. 
     109 The matters requiring investigation, determination and assessment should be dealt with in a first instance court. It is undesirable that primary findings be made at appellate level and I consider that the issue of sentence should be remitted to the District Court for redetermination in the light of this judgment and any further evidence which is forthcoming. Given the apparent strength of his Honour’s observations the matter, when returned, ought be dealt with afresh by another judge of the District Court.  
     110 In the interim, I would propose that the respondent be granted bail by a single judge of the Supreme Court on suitable conditions, those conditions to include a requirement that the respondent make herself available and cooperate with any request to attend or provide information to Corrective Services or relevant authority in connection with any assessment or procedure concerning her possible commitment to custody and contact thereafter with her child. 
     111 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      (1) Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      (2) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (3) Matter remitted to the District Court for imposition of appropriate sentence. 
       
     112 EINFELD AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Grove albeit not entirely for the same reasons or with the same critique of the reasoning of the learned sentencing judge. In my opinion it was open to his Honour on the evidence to conclude that the respondent was in real and significant fear of sexual misadventure while in custody and was otherwise susceptible to quite serious psychological adversity. I think that there was sufficient material on which to conclude that she had suffered sexual abuse in her youth from her father and uncle and that she had recently attempted to commit suicide, probably reflecting her desolate situation at this time. 
     113 However, as appears to have been recognized by his Honour, these facts would not support a non-custodial sentence for the serious offence in question here. The decision to bypass the term of imprisonment which would ordinarily be attracted was largely energised by the fact that at the time of sentencing the respondent’s then 2+ months old baby was being breastfed and that the separation of mother and baby at such a time would create a serious interference with the child’s wellbeing such as to create an exceptional circumstance. 
     114 I do not share the doubts expressed by Justice Grove that the respondent was in fact breastfeeding her baby at the time. It is true that the evidence on the matter was sparse and regrettably and quite surprisingly neither the respondent nor any family member gave evidence. But the inference does arise from documentary material placed before his Honour and does not seem to have been then challenged, as it was not challenged before this Court. I agree that having regard to its importance on the severity and category of sentence, evidence on the matter should have been called. But the failure to do so does not change the fact upon which the sentencing hearing was apparently conducted. That basis for sentencing should not now be discarded. 
     115 I also agree with respect with Justice Grove’s expressed doubts about the adequacy of the evidence on the capacity of the correctional services system and facilities to be able to cope adequately with the situation which would be faced by the respondent were she to serve a term of imprisonment. Again, further evidence was desirable in the circumstances. However, again the sentencing hearing seems to have been conducted on the agreed basis that the system would, to say the least, not be ideal or even good for a very young baby being breastfed. 
     116 The 1990 Innocenti Declaration on the Protection, Promotion and Support of Breastfeeding issued by UNICEF after a long and detailed expert study stated that breastfeeding is a “unique process that provides ideal nutrition for infants and contributes to their health growth and development.” The Declaration goes on to recognize that breastfeeding: 
      
       
        
        “ 
        
       
     · Reduces the incidence and severity of infectious diseases, thereby lowering infant morbidity and mortality;· Contributes to women’s health by reducing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and by increasing the space between pregnancies;· Provides social and economic benefits to the family and the nation; and· Provides most women with a sense of satisfaction when successfully carried out.” 
     117 The Innocenti Declaration established as a global goal that: 
      
       
        
        “… all women should be enabled to practise exclusive breastfeeding and all infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4-6 months of age. Thereafter children should continue to be breastfed (with solids and supplements) for up to two years of age or beyond.” 
        
       
     118 Governments were called upon to implement these and supporting policies. Australia supported the Declaration. 
     119 I will not repeat the references in the judgments of other members of this Court to provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Children’s Convention) and its relevance and use in Australia. This Convention is the most widely ratified and accepted international treaty in history, only two countries (Somalia and the United States of America) not having ratified it. But this case is not a suitable vehicle to examine whether a different approach to international law in the Australian context is called for, even overdue, such as I discussed in Minister for Foreign Affairs & Trade v Magno 1992 37 FCR 298. 
     120 It is, however, important to add a reference to Articles 6 and 24 of the Children’s Convention. Article 6 mandates States “to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.” Article 24 upholds the child’s right to the highest attainable standard of health. It requires States Parties to take appropriate measures “to ensure that all segments of society, in particular parents and children …are supported in the use of basic knowledge of child health and nutrition, the advantages of breastfeeding, hygiene and environmental sanitation and the prevention of accidents.” (my emphasis). 
     121 Furthermore, Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, also ratified and in large measure legislated by Australia, requires States to supply “appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the post-natal period … as well as nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.” 
     122 Australia has also accepted the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes adopted by the World Health Organization in 1981. Paragraph 1 of the Code states its aims as being “to contribute to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breastfeeding…” 
     123 I find it difficult to accept that this substantial accumulation of solemn voluntary commitment by Australia to support a clear right for babies to be breastfed for a substantial period can be accorded no weight, or can have little effect, on the process of sentencing a breastfeeding mother. On the other hand, other than in the general nurturing sense, my researches have not detected a single case of the present kind having arisen under the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom or New Zealand Human Rights Acts, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or the South African or the United States of America’s Bills of Rights, all of which contain general clauses that enshrine the health and wellbeing of infants and their mothers as important legislative objects. 
     124 I have looked at some American cases but they principally focus on the effects of mandatory sentencing on mothers with young babies. In United States v Johnson 908 F.2d 396, 399 (8th Cir.1990), it was explicitly recognized that the rationale for less than the mandatory minimum sentence was not that it decreased the defendant’s culpability, but that “we are reluctant to wreak extraordinary destruction on dependants who rely solely on the defendant for their upbringing.” 
     125 Both before and after Johnson, numerous district court cases have granted departures for single mothers – for example, United States v Gerard, 782 F.Supp. 913, 914-15 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); United States v Pokuaa 782 F.Supp. 747, 747-48 (E.D.N.Y. 1992); United States v Handy, 752 F.Supp 561, 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1990); United States v Mills Nos. 88 CR 956 (CSH) & 89 CR 256 (CSH), 1990 WL 8081 (S.D.N.Y. Jan 17, 1990); United States v Gonzalez No S 88 CR 559 (CSH), 1989 WL 86021 (S.D.N.Y. Jul 27, 1989); United States v Hon, No 89 CR 0052 (RWS), 1989 WL 59613 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 1989); United States v Williams, 88CR 144 (E.D.N.Y. 1988). 
     126 The other members of the Court have drawn attention to whatever authority exists in this country but in my respectful opinion those cases do not help to resolve this case. However, the cases show quite unequivocally that Australian Courts will not withhold imprisonment solely because to do so will separate mother and child. 
     127 I am respectfully unable to agree that in a given case, including perhaps this one, it would be entirely erroneous and inappropriate to suspend the whole of any custodial sentence imposed. For myself, I would at least not wish to fetter the re-sentence of this respondent because of a pre-decision of such a kind. Except that I respectfully agree that if a jail sentence were given, three years is insufficient, I agree in the orders proposed by Justice Grove essentially for other reasons. 
     128 The respondent became pregnant some five months after she was apprehended at Sydney Airport at about the time she gave her first public intimation that she would admit the offence and plead guilty to the charge in question. Even if she conceived her child before this time, certainly if the conception took place afterwards, she knew at the time of conception that she had committed the offence and would in all likelihood face a significant term of imprisonment. The time and circumstances of the conception are thus important. It would be a travesty of justice if by deliberately falling pregnant, a woman could escape a prison term which was otherwise called for. The District Court was given no evidence on this matter at all. In fact, the question does not even seem to have been raised in the sentencing process. 
     129 A second matter also arises. The respondent’s child is now a little over eleven months old. Although no expert evidence was called on this matter, it seems at least arguable that the longer the period of breastfeeding, the less risky it is for baby and mother to cease the process. Whether the respondent is still breastfeeding is not known. In fact, no consideration seems to have been given to the possibility that the respondent commence to serve her custodial sentence at the end of her breastfeeding. And no reasons were given for not considering that option. Moreover, there was no evidence of the arrangements which would and could be made for the care and custody of this baby in the community if the respondent goes to prison after the breastfeeding stops. 
     130 All these unanswered queries point to the significance for a proper sentencing hearing in this case of sworn evidence capable of being fully tested and examined, and to the adverse consequences for the process so far undertaken in this case that no such evidence was given. I respectfully agree with Justice Grove that no unfavourable inferences may be drawn from the failure of the respondent to give evidence before the District Court. But the fact that she did not give evidence meant that the exceptional circumstances relied on by his Honour to justify his exceptional decision were left too much to inference and assumption. However these mechanisms for the resolution of difficult legal issues may be justifiable and necessary in other cases, they are not sufficient in this case when clear direct evidence was and would have been available but was deliberately or wrongly withheld. 
     131 When the matter returns to the District Court, it is my opinion that that Court should determine whether it should be heard by the same or a different judge. In the light of my views on the possibility of at least a partially non-custodial sentence, I cannot see why it must follow as a necessity that the re-sentencing be undertaken by another judge than undertook the task on this occasion.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Grove J. I also agree with the additional observations of Sperling J. There is a clear distinction between counts 1-5 and counts 6-13 both in terms of the issues at the trial and in terms of the length of delay. In the circumstances, a Longman warning was required only with respect to the earlier counts. (See R v Dixon [2001] NSWCCA 39, especially at [78] and R v Green [2001] SASC 25 at [32]-[43] ). 
      
       
     2 GROVE J: The appellant was tried at Sydney District Court before her Honour Judge Morgan and a jury upon an indictment charging thirteen counts of a variety of sexual offences committed between 1987 and 1994. The trial extended over five to six weeks between May and June 2000. The appellant was convicted on all counts and the structure of sentences imposed resulted in a non parole period being specified which established 19 October 2007 as the earliest date for parole eligibility. The appellant conducted the trial on his own behalf but he has been legally represented in this appeal. 
      
       
     3 The appellant was born on 24 July 1945. All offences involve the same victim who was one of twin sisters born on 7 June 1974 in Fiji where the appellant and his wife then resided. When the twins were very young they were adopted by the appellant and his wife and moved from an orphanage and thereafter lived in a home in Fiji. The family came to live in Australia in about 1980, the first place of significant residence being at Emerald in Queensland. At that time the family consisted of the parents, the twin girls and a natural born son. Later, two more sons were born.  
      
       
     4 The complainant gave evidence that her first recollection of anything of a sexual nature occurring between the appellant and herself was in Emerald when she was aged under eleven years. Emerald is, of course, outside of New South Wales jurisdiction. The family moved to this State in about 1987 and the first count charged relates to an event shortly after arrival when the family were resident in a caravan park near Botany Bay. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all of the sexual acts. The fifth count alleged an act of penile/vaginal intercourse taking place on the complainant’s sixteenth birthday (on 7 June 1990). The sixth count alleged a similar act in early 1992 when the appellant conveyed her home from a TAFE where some administrative matters had been attended to and when no one was at home upon their arrival. The final (thirteenth) count again charged a similar act in late 1994. At that time the complainant was in employment and preparing to leave the family home and live independently. It is acknowledged that there is dispute about some of the dates but contradictions can be referenced if necessary when dealing with relevant issues. 
      
       
     5 A written submission on behalf of the appellant acknowledged that the evidence of the complainant, if accepted, justified the findings of the jury on each count. At trial the appellant cross examined the complainant over some ten days. The transcript of his cross examination exceeds 500 pages. The appellant did not give evidence. His questioning revealed that he was not disputing the acts charged in counts six to thirteen but was contending that they took place in circumstances wherein the complainant was a consenting party. This was confirmed in his transcribed final address at trial. 
      
       
     6 The grounds of appeal were expressed in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The verdict of the jury in relation to each count of the indictment should be quashed on the grounds set out hereunder. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The Appellant was without legal representation at his trial. 
         
        
        
         
         3. It was beyond the capacity of the Appellant to conduct a trial of this complexity bearing in mind the peculiar features of cases involving sexual assault. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The Appellant was in such poor health throughout the course of the trial that he was physically and mentally unable to make decisions relating to the conduct of the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         5. The Trial Judge erred in not staying the trial until legal representation was available to the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The Appellant was originally indicted on 13 counts relating to (the complainant’s twin) and there is confusion about the way in which the Crown substituted 13 counts relating to (the complainant). 
         
        
        
         
         7. Due to his poor health and inexperience the Appellant was unable to make a reasoned decision whether he should give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         8. Due to his poor health and inexperience the Appellant was unable to make a reasoned decision whether he should call evidence in the Defence Case. 
         
        
        
         
         9. The Trial Judge erred in her direction to the jury in relation to evidence of complaint. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give directions to the jury in relation to corroboration. 
         
        
        
         
         11. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to character. 
         
        
        
         
         12. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to his failure to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         13. The Trial Judge erred in her directions to the jury in relation to his failure to call evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         14. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
        
         
         15. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give proper weight to the evidence of the character of the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         16. The Trial Judge erred in her failure to give proper weight to the evidence of remorse and contrition. 
         
        
       
     7 Several of the grounds were obviously associated and it will be appropriate to deal with them together but first there should be a recording of some procedural matters touching upon the hearing of the appeal and in respect of which the Court sought, and received, submissions on a discrete issue. It has been observed that one possibility of the outcome of argument on the issue to which I now turn was that a new trial on all counts might need to be ordered. After deliberation, the Court determined to reconvene and hear further argument particularly on the balance of the grounds. 
      
       
        
       The Absence of a Longman Direction 
        
       
     8 The appeal was listed for hearing on Thursday 16 August 2001. On the preceding Thursday 9 August, the High Court handed down its judgment in Doggett v The Queen 2001 75 ALJR 1290. The apparent potential applicability of that authority to the present matter persuaded the Court to seek submissions from the parties in that regard. Both counsel for the Crown and for the appellant were given leave to supplement their oral submissions in writing and, in due course, these were provided.  
      
       
     9 The Court in Doggett divided, the majority being constituted by Gaudron and Callinan JJ who published a joint judgment and Kirby J. Gleeson CJ and McHugh J dissented. The issue was whether the trial judge should be held to have erred in not giving the jury what has come to be called a Longman direction: Longman v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 79. 
      
       
     10 As Gleeson CJ, in dissent, commented, it is not particularly enlightening to use the expression “a Longman warning” unless accompanied by an explanation of the terms of the warning. Kirby J observed that there were differences in the reasoning in Longman as to precisely why a warning was necessary notwithstanding statutory relief from the obligation formerly required by common law but he noted a common element in the judgments in that case recognizing the serious forensic disadvantages suffered by an accused person meeting, for the first time, accusations made long after the subject offences were alleged to have occurred. Analysis has shown that Longman does not identify clearly when a warning is mandatory save by reference to the loss by an accused of means of testing a complainant’s testimony which may not have been apparent to the jury: R v GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493. 
      
       
     11 In their joint judgment in Longman, Brennan, Toohey and Dawson JJ had said (@ p91): 
      
       
        
         
         “The jury should have been told that, as the evidence of the complainant could not be adequately tested after the passage of more than twenty years, it would be dangerous to convict on that evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinizing the evidence with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy. To leave a jury without such a full appreciation of the danger was to risk a miscarriage of justice. The jury were told simply to consider the relative credibility of the complainant and the appellant without either a warning or a mention of the factors relevant to the evaluation of the evidence. That was not sufficient.” 
          
         
        
       
     12 Doggett makes it clear that the presence of the word “alone” in that passage should not be taken to mean that the mere existence of corroborative evidence extinguishes the requirement for a Longman direction. 
      
       
     13 The reasoning and application to the then instant case was elaborated in the joint judgment in Doggett (@ p 1297): 
      
       
        
         
         “[46] In our opinion, the corroborative evidence which was led here did not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to give a  
         Longman 
          direction for the following reasons. 
          
          
         [47] First, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the circumstances surrounding the first three counts made the point that the complainant’s recollection of some matters was, to say the least, questionable. 
          
          
         [48] Secondly, the suggested explanation for the complainant’s assertions as to the approximate times of the first two offences is not one, with respect, which strikes us as very likely. It was not suggested as an explanation by the trial judge in his summing up on these counts. If it had been, there and then it would probably have drawn attention to the need for a direction of the very kind for which  
         Longman 
          stands. 
          
          
         [49] Thirdly, there was evidence from an apparently independent source, Ms A, categorically denying sworn evidence by the complainant that she had told Ms A some years before that she had been sexually touched by the appellant. 
          
          
         [50] Fourthly, and inevitably, the respondent was obliged to some extent to shift the basis of the prosecution when the discrepancy as to dates with respect to the first two counts, and consequentially if less significantly, to the third, emerged. 
          
          
         [51] Fifthly, the problems with which  
         Longman 
          is intended to deal are not confined to difficulties of recollection that the passage of time might cause for an accused. Of equal, and in some cases of which this might be one, or more importance is the denial by the effluxion of time, to an accused of the forensic weapons that a timely complaint might allow an accused to assemble, such as evidence as to where he was or what he was doing, or what other potential witnesses were doing when the offences were alleged to have occurred. 
          
          
         [52] This is made clear by the joint judgment (Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ) in  
         Crampton v The Queen 
          (2000) 75 ALJR 133: 
          
          
           
           ‘The trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellant was, by reason of the very great delay, unable adequately to test and meet the evidence of the complainant. Her Honour should not have offered the qualification that she did in relation to the remarks she did make about the delay. An accused’s defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides, constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. Almost all of the passage of the majority in  
           Longman 
            to which we have referred (with appropriate adaptations to the circumstances of this case, including that because of the passage of so many years, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant’s evidence alone without the closest scrutiny of the complainant’s evidence), should have been put to the jury.’ 
            
           
          
         [53] Sixthly, as we have already indicated, the corroboration was capable of establishing some undefined sexual molestation, probably improper, but not necessarily criminal in the respects alleged in the counts, and therefore not of such a nature as to relieve the trial judge of a duty to direct the jury in terms of  
         Longman 
          as explained in the passage from  
         Crampton 
          set out above. 
          
          
         [54] Seventhly, the approach of the Court of Appeal involved to some extent an inversion of reasoning. The correct approach in our opinion was to examine the evidence relevant to the particular matters with which  
         Longman 
          deals to ascertain whether the case called for a  
         Longman 
          direction, and not to make a broad assessment of the evidence overall (including the corroborative evidence), and to decide at that point, that the corroboration rendered a  
         Longman 
          direction unnecessary. That exercise should more appropriately be carried out in the overall assessment of the case, if and after error has been established, to enable the Court to decide whether the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and whether the proviso should be applied.” 
          
         
        
       
     14 In the course of her charge to the jury in the present matter the learned trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I should also point out to you that there has been a delay between the time when these events were alleged to have occurred, as she has said, back in Emerald and then when she was in this eight or nine year old period and then continuing on right up until just before she left home. But taking those earlier matters back in 1987 and earlier and, as I say, if you accept they took place in Emerald, that the accused may well have been at some disadvantage because of the delay which it has taken for her to bring this to anyone’s attention. And it may be that at that time, if anything had been raised when she was a young girl either in Emerald or in the early days here in Sydney, that it may well be that the accused might have been able to produce some evidence to suggest, well I wasn’t home at that time, he used to go away from Emerald on his business, or it would be an impossibility for something to have happened at that time. Well that is a matter entirely for you, whether you consider he was disadvantaged but that is certainly a matter which you should consider when you are looking at the Crown case.” 
          
         
        
       
     15 In written submissions (prepared before delivery of judgment in Doggett) the Crown Prosecutor contended that Longman would have no application because there was evidence in the case which could be regarded as corroborative. In particular reference was made to the evidence of the appellant’s brother and his sister in law. Whilst the capacity of the content of the evidence of the latter to amount to corroboration may be in dispute there is no reason to withhold that classification from the confessional material testified to by the appellant’s brother.  
      
       
     16 However, it was conceded by the Crown Prosecutor that that argument as expressed could not succeed in the light of the majority judgments in Doggett. It was further conceded that the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury did not contain directions which would comply with the requirements of Longman if that authority were held to be applicable. The passage of the charge to the jury which I have reproduced would seem the logical place for such a direction and it can be seen that none there appears. The absence is not a criticism of the trial judge who did not have the benefit of the authority and guidance available from Doggett.  
      
       
     17 The question for this Court is what effect the authority of Doggett should have on the conduct and outcome of the trial. 
      
       
     18 There was evidence presented by the Crown going back many years, indeed evidence about occurrences in Emerald whilst not chargeable by reason of jurisdictional limits was tendered in order to inculpate the appellant. Not only the complainant’s evidence but that of the appellant’s sister in law had focussed upon matters in the distant past when the family were resident in Queensland. 
      
       
     19 Following the hearing on the preliminary (Doggett) issue, solicitors for the appellant filed an affidavit sworn by the appellant’s wife (TJK). No leave to file or read such an affidavit was sought or given however, at the resumed hearing counsel indicated that in respect to the deponents of the significant number of affidavits by then accumulated cross examination was not sought on the basis of agreement that neither would seek to gain advantage from the absence of express challenge to an individual deponent if submission was to be made that any of the content of an affidavit should not be accepted or acted upon. 
      
       
     20 In accordance with leave granted, written submissions on the issue were forwarded on behalf of the appellant and on behalf of the Crown. The submissions on behalf of the appellant did not take the course encouraged by the Court of specifying the obstacles and handicaps pertinent to the appellant’s case in a fashion similar to the exercise undertaken in the joint judgment in Doggett where some seven reasons for the trial judge not being relieved of the obligation to give a Longman direction were scheduled. The bulk of the submission related to citation of selected passages from reported authority. It may have been helpful to analyse the circumstances evidenced at trial and therefrom seek to deduce obstacles to the appellant’s conduct of the case. In encouraging the course suggested it was not implied that the reasons in the appellant’s case should be identical to those in Doggett; some may have been comparable and there may be other and different reasons. However, a summary submission was advanced that because of delay in complaint it had been made “almost impossible for the appellant and his wife to try to track down real evidence, documentary evidence, council records, real estate agent’s records, school records, the church records, evidence of relatives, friends, neighbours, teachers and church members.”  
      
       
     21 The reasons for seeking such things were expressed as generalities and (compared to the bulk of submission) relatively briefly, viz: 
      
       
        
         
         “74. The question of objective evidence being available to identify just when it was that the K family lived at various places was of great importance. The Complainant had suggested that various events of significance occurred at particular times and at particular places. 
         
        
        
         
         75. The evidence of the Appellant’s wife TJK, in her affidavit sworn 22 August 2001 was filed to illustrate problems that faced the Appellant and his wife in obtaining evidence which might have been used to balance the evidence that had been given at trial by the Complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         76. There was even great importance in fixing when it was that the K family moved to Emerald in Queensland to live. 
         
        
        
         
         77. It was important to establish when various events occurred at their local Church. It was important to establish when it was that various friends and related inter acted with the K family. It was important that this evidence be very accurate to balance the evidence of the Complainant. 
         
        
        
         
         78. Turning to the affidavit of TJK: In paragraph 2 she gave evidence of the search by her and by the Appellant for records, photos, diaries, correspondence and potential witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         79. In paragraph 4 she gave evidence of the difficulties experienced in obtaining evidence relating to the period of time the K family spent in Emerald Queensland. 
         
        
        
         
         80. In paragraph 5 she gave evidence of the difficulties experienced in obtaining evidence relating to events in New South Wales. That period of time was of course most important because it included vital evidence relating to the circumstances surrounding various places where it alleged offences were committed by the Appellant.” 
         
        
       
     22 Express mention will be made of the content of some affidavits but the bulk emanates from family members (the appellant’s wife and sons) and is of little objective assistance. It is scarcely surprising that they would detect that the appellant appeared stressed as this would be expected of anybody facing trial on serious criminal charges. Nothing will be served by summarizing the affidavits, much of the descriptive content of which is couched in hyperbole. There are also demonstrable inaccuracies for example, TJK asserted that the judge told BKK that he could not take off his jacket in court and there followed a tale of leaving the jacket at home which was said to be “symptomatic of his stress and disorientation”. In fact BKK did complain of feeling the heat and her Honour responded “well see how you go, if you find that it’s unbearable, remove your coat”. (T125) All material will be weighed in the final analysis of whether the trial has been unfair and that comment applies equally to the affidavit material produced by the Crown. 
      
       
     23 Upon reconvening the Court specifically invited submissions on the issue of whether the appeal should be allowed on some counts and refused on some counts. The potential differentiation was between the more recent counts on the indictment for which the occurrence of the events was in issue. No submissions on this point were forthcoming from counsel for the appellant. Crown counsel submitted simply that such a course was open to the Court. 
      
       
     24 In my opinion such a course is open where there is an appellable error that affects one or some of the counts, but not the remainder of the counts. 
      
       
     25 There is a distinction to be drawn in the present case between the cogency of complaints of handicap where, on the one hand, the appellant denies sexual dealing with the complainant and on the other, dispute is limited to the proof of absence of consent to admitted sexual congress. 
      
       
     26 The Crown resisted the conclusion that the absence of a Longman direction should lead to a new trial. 
      
       
     27 First it was argued that in Doggett the majority apparently regarded the corroborative evidence as of inferior quality leaving open the possibility that in an appropriate case corroborative evidence may remove the need for a Longman direction. The sixth mentioned reason in the extract from the joint judgment is pertinent. Kirby J also remarked: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Gaudron J pointed out in  
         M v The Queen 
          (1994) 181 CLR 487 ‘corroboration or lack thereof is only one of many considerations which bear on the evaluation of evidence’. Furthermore, where (as here) the corroboration is patchy, in some respects unspecific and in others completely silent on the incidents referred to in the charges, the mere fact that corroborative evidence of some kind exists will not entirely remove the utility, and the necessity, of a  
         Longman 
          warning.” 
          
         
        
       
     28 Whether there be some case where corroboration is so strong that warning is not required, the present case cannot be so classified. The evidence of conversation with the sister in law included ambiguities and oblique references to such things as “mandatory reporting of child abuse” (as an alleged Queensland state requirement). Whilst more pointed and including an admission by the appellant of having “sex”, the evidence of the appellant’s brother nevertheless included generalities such as assertions that he ignored “the rest because they were all rantings and ravings”. These remarks need to be qualified in relation to the thirteenth (final) count when, on the day following the alleged offence, the complainant’s condition was viewed and assessed by witnesses including medical experts who detected signs consistent with the allegation. Corroboration available in respect of that count was markedly stronger. 
      
       
     29 The object, of which sight must not be lost, is assistance to a jury particularly with respect to considerations of which they may not be aware and with which they may not be familiar. Determination of whether the jury has had appropriate assistance cannot be dependent upon an isolated assessment of the strength or otherwise of corroborative evidence, the weight to which a jury has concluded should be given, will be unknown.  
      
       
     30 The second aspect of the Crown argument involved an extensive and painstaking survey of matters relating to the distant past which the appellant was able to refer to in detail – it was described as minute detail - which was manifest particularly in his cross examination of witnesses including the complainant. 
      
       
     31 So impressive in its extent were these matters and associated documentation produced or under reference, that it was submitted that in the “perhaps unique” circumstances of the case the Court should hold that a Longman direction was not required. 
      
       
     32 The warning to the jury does not concern what an accused has in fact been able to produce. It is concerned with informing the jury and cautioning them about matters which may have handicapped that accused and as a consequence obstructed him from being able to elucidate circumstances or demonstrate facts which support his contentions. That is not to invite a jury to speculate upon what an accused may have been able to prove and expression of a Longman direction must be so designed as to avoid that error. 
      
       
     33 There is, however, a matter in relation to the appellant’s claims of handicap which is unusual. In the disturbingly large number of cases concerning sexual abuse which come before the courts, where there is dispute between an alleged offender and a child (at the time of offence) complainant, the issue is frequently whether sexual activity took place at all. This has previously been observed by Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ in Crampton @ p141. Consent is of course irrelevant and provides no basis for defence in such cases. The sexual activity will usually be alleged to have occurred in secret and it is in seeking to support a denial of occurrence that the handicap encountered by an alleged offender has been perceived. Recognition of such matters does not imply any shift in the burden of proof. Longman for example was a case itself of denial by an accused who, when questioned by police (and at trial), described his dealings with the complainant as entirely innocent. It adds to difficulties faced in such circumstances that there would have been necessarily dealings between disputant parties, they very frequently having resided as members of a domestic unit. It is acknowledged that Doggett had some unusual features in allegations by the alleged offender of sexually precocious advances by the complainant, but in that case all offences charged involved conduct when she was aged under sixteen years. 
      
       
     34 The unusual matter to which I refer in relation to the appellant affects the sixth to thirteenth counts. Each of these counts charged sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The cross examination of the complainant showed that the appellant did not contest the occurrence of sexual congress but essentially claimed that she was a consenting party. 
      
       
     35 A synopsis of the basis of each count and the conduct by the appellant of his case at trial should be made.  
      
       
     36 Count six was located by reference to the complainant having left school at age sixteen, attended TAFE as an evening student for a year (1991) and making a decision to seek to repeat that year. Arrangements were made to see the College Head and the appellant accompanied the complainant on that visit. Afterwards when they returned home there was no one else in. Intercourse took place against the complainant’s wishes. Significantly the appellant put this question to her (T594): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I am therefore not denying that there was full vaginal penetration when you talked about coming back from the TAFE College. I am not denying that. I put it to you that that was the first time there was ever full vaginal penetration? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     37 Count seven was referenced by the complainant to a celebration of the eighteenth birthday of the twin girls which did not occur on the actual birthday but within one or two weeks thereof. The complainant gave evidence of a series of sexual acts performed on her by the appellant including sodomy, attempted fellatio, penile intercourse and cunnilingus. The appellant cross examined the complainant about a number of matters relating to the preparations for the party and the closeness of the relationship between them alleged to have been in existence at the time. I cannot identify questions asked by the appellant which concede specific sexual activity on this occasion but the following extract (T717) suggests that any denial is focussed upon the allegation of the combination of events rather than denial of sexual conduct. In this context the wide statutory definition of sexual intercourse is germane. The evidence was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Thank you. Going back to the incident of your 18 birthday and referring to the evidence in chief at page 173, which you won’t have, line 30, the Crown asked: 
         
        
        
         
         ‘Q. What sort of a noise did you make?’ You replied ‘A. Like a, like a whimpering noise and he just told me to shut up or else I’ll wake my sister. I goes, No, well it hurts. And then, and I, and I rolled over and then he, he tried to put his penis in my mouth’. Remember that answer? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did I not yesterday ask a brief general question about the personal hygiene of yourself and myself and you gave positive answers in relation to that, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That we both have high standards of hygiene and personal cleanliness, remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well I reject emphatically, entirely and completely and I put this to you, this is completely and utterly wrong that I would ever go from penis to anus to penis in mouth to penis in vagina. I reject that and I put to you this is a blatant lie? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No it is not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also suggest to you the event never happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did.” 
         
        
       
     38 The eighth count was evidenced by a description by the complainant of an occasion whilst the appellant’s wife was away in the Blue Mountains and the three boys stayed at a friend’s house. The twin girls went to see a film with the appellant and on return he demanded that the complainant engage in sexual congress with him. She described the occurrence which included penile/vaginal intercourse. The appellant cross examined the complainant at length concerning the time of the year during which his wife went to a conference or seminar in the Blue Mountains. He also cross examined her about detail of the actual residential address at the time and the films which were showing in Sydney at the time.  
      
       
     39 The appellant produced a lease to support his contradiction of the accuracy of the complainant’s testimony concerning the date of this offence by demonstrating that the family was not in occupation of the premises specified at the time. However the cogency of that attack has been undermined by the content of the appellant’s wife’s recent affidavit which includes: 
      
       
        
         
         “The complainant identified a particular incident by reference to my attendance at a conference for teachers in the Blue Mountains. I know that the conference was at another place and another date, but despite diligent searching I cannot find a diary or other record that would provide verification.” 
         
        
       
     40 The challenges would need to be assessed in the light of the general posture of the appellant which did not deny the existence of a sexual relationship between the father and adopted daughter. A revealing exchange is recorded at T588-599: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Given the general description that you have given of your mother’s work and that you had your own single bedroom, I put it to you that is when the relationship between your father and yourself began to intensify. We are talking here around late 1991, 1992. What I mean by relationship, that is when you were first caressed in 1991 in the downstairs area of Halcyon Avenue. 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is garbage. That is a lie. You used to do it to me in Carrington Road. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. We have heard that before. I also put to you the first time your father did caress you, he himself went into deep shock at what he had done? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. It is not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you that what stunned him the most was your positive reaction? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you that from then on in you did everything to encourage a sexual relationship? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also say to you that at Halcyon Avenue towards the end of 1991 there was already an occasion did occur where, late 1991, where you did, it did actually lead to ejaculation but not penetration, late 1991, because of the caressing and the messing about? 
         
        
        
         
         A. (No verbal response). 
         
        
        
         
         HER HONOUR: Can you answer that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I did not realise it was a question. I thought he was stating something. I was waiting for him to ask me a question. 
         
        
        
         
         ACCUSED: Q. In late 1991 because of the caressing did it lead then eventually to ejaculation because we were both messing about on the bed, do you remember at that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it because that happened your father said ‘No (R), no, this is not for me to do this, is wrong. One day you will meet up with someone your own age and it is for that person to do’. That is what your father said? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. It is a lot of garbage. It never happened. I never said that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Your reaction was, ‘No there is nothing wrong. What’s wrong about this’ and that then led to your comment, ‘What’s the difference between me and as if a strange woman walked into this place’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is garbage. That is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Later on I recall, I am putting to you later on in Alice Street in September/October 1994, I reminded you of this event and I said to you ‘(R) I used to always wonder about this so-called strange woman walking down the driveway’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Never said any such thing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you in September/October 1994 the reason why I said that to you is because in September and October 1994 I was saying to you again ‘The affair must end, we have got to go and get help’? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Garbage. Outright lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I also put to you in September/October 1994 that the major topic of discussion between you and me was whether or not at law there was an incestuous relationship and I would face criminal prosecution because of it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie. You never ever said that.” 
         
        
       
     41 The ninth count alleged an act of intercourse in bushland while returning from a journey to an airport during a family holiday at Bermagui. Again the descriptions by the complainant were of enforced acts including penile/vaginal intercourse. The appellant cross examined the complainant about a considerable amount of detail concerning the events at Bermagui, however there was a significant suggestion by him that there had been discussion between them that there would be a sexual encounter before return from the journey to the airport. Cross examination by the appellant included (T698): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. All right. I would suggest to you in relation to the answer that you gave that, going back to line 45 plus, ‘He ripped the L plates off the front of the Toyota and told me to get in the passenger side which’. I don’t know what the ‘which’ is for but that’s what you said. That’s partly correct but hides the real reason as to why that incident took place and I put it to you that we were actually running behind time. We knew we were going to get late into Bermagui and we already had discussed the fact that we were going – that there was going to be a sexual encounter before we got home. It had already been discussed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, that’s a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t.” 
         
        
        
         
         And: 
         
        
        
         
         “Q. I put to you this is what happened; as we were approaching the T intersection. I said to you ‘Look, Honey, it is getting late, we better go home’ which would mean then I would continue on to the T intersection, turn left and go home and you replied, ‘No it’s not too late, it’s all right, let’s go’ or words to that effect and you said ‘turn here’. Do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No I don’t. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The reason why you said ‘turn here’ was because if you go there even today three is a little dirt track just prior to the T intersection where, if you turn left, it goes into what is generally known as the Bermagui National Park, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I remember an entry to the National Park but I don’t know about dirt. The dirt track is in the National Park. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Furthermore I said ‘are you sure’ and you replied explicitly, ‘yes, yes, I want to’, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Didn’t happen. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And it is not surprising, I put to you, that you said, ‘yes, yes, I want to’ because for the previous 10 minutes or half an hour you had been caressed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is an outright lie.” 
         
        
       
     42 The tenth count involved an allegation that forced intercourse had taken place at the complainant’s place of employment at Artarmon. Cross examination by the appellant did not involve a denial of sexual intercourse and in fact posited that it occurred “regularly” there. (T602): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Without conceding the date of the 26th of February 1994, I do agree that sexual intercourse did take place at Snap Artarmon on a fairly regular occasion and I also state that the act of sexual intercourse did take place on what is known as the trimming bench at Snap Artarmon. I do not deny that. I am not allowed to make a statement, so I put it to you that what I have just said is basically – you would agree with me I’m telling a truthful statement when I say that, that there was sexual intercourse between you and me regularly at Snap Artarmon? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know the question you are asking me. If are you asking me did it happen regularly or that it did happen on the trimming bench? 
          
          
         Q. It happened regularly. I think you have already said yes? 
          
          
         A. No, I didn’t understand when you meant regularly, like that’s the incident. I could remember when I made my statement and it did happen. 
          
          
         Q. Did it happen almost invariably each time your father went with yo to work overtime at Snap Artarmon? 
          
          
         A. Are you saying every time on the trimming bench did the sex act? 
          
          
         Q. Just the act of sexual intercourse, did it? 
          
          
         A. Like I said, they are the two times I could remember when I made my statement.” 
         
        
       
     43 The eleventh count was described by the complainant with reference to driving lessons which the appellant gave her during which they visited the Mt White area just near the old Pacific Highway. The complainant said there were many incidents between them on these driving lessons. The content of the appellant’s cross examination did not seem to involve denial, indeed at one point he put questions to the complainant suggesting she had said to him that she would move her position in the car “so Mum won’t suspect or guess what’s going on”. The appellant did not expressly concede the description of events by the complainant but, consistently with his assertion that there was a “relationship” between them, he asked questions such as (T666): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I also suggest that there are other paragraphs in your statement where the paragraphs scream consent? 
         
        
        
         
         A. (No verbal response). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes or no? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I don’t know the question you are asking. I thought that was a statement.” 
         
        
       
     44 The issue which the appellant appeared to be seeking to canvass was the precise location of the alleged misconduct which he referred to from time to time as “events”, for example, (T668): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I suggest to you that if the event took place it took place near pine trees on a divided road, you are quite correct. When you came out from underneath the pine trees you actually almost turned the car into on coming traffic and that is hence the panic. I grabbed the wheel, swung the car round and put it in the opposite direction for you.” 
         
        
       
     45 The twelfth count was identified as to time by reference to a mock wedding ceremony held by a youth group of which the complainant was a member and a red dress which she borrowed to wear on the occasion. It was on her return home that she described another sexual attack by the appellant. Cross examination by the appellant was directed towards detail in the complainant’s statement concerning a description of the complainant taking off her red dress and taking something from the bed to cover herself and flicking it away. The peripheral detail was put in issue by the appellant but not the act of intercourse. Some of his cross examination included (T768): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The Crown asked you on p 210 at the bottom line 57,58: ‘Did you take the dress off’? And you replied ‘Yes I did’. And the Crown, do you remember that answer? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Those when I came back yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And the Crown went on further to say did something happen at that point and you said, yes, my father had come in and then there you continued to give well – I have got to go on with it. The Crown asked what happened when you came in and you replied: ‘He asked why did you take the dress off and I had grabbed something off the bed to cover myself’; do you remember? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. and he said how were you dressed? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was just in my under pants. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And in fairness you grabbed something and then yo replied you tried to flick them away do you remember answering that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That is what I am puzzled about because the Crown asked what were you trying to flick away and you replied I grabbed something off of the bed and was holding it in front every myself and he was trying to flick whatever I was holding away. I cannot remember what it was. I put it to you you cannot remember because it never happened? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes it did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I put it to you the reason why you came home by 10pm that night, and that this event never happened is you wanted to make love with your red dress on? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That is a lie.” 
         
        
       
     46 The thirteenth count relates to an occurrence in October 1994 when the complainant had determined to leave the family home. In the evening there was some discussion between the appellant, his wife and the complainant. She said that later in the evening she was in her room when the appellant entered and told her to take her nightie off and intercourse took place in the complainant’s bed. The appellant did not deny this act of intercourse but cross examined the complainant at length about the details as to how it occurred. He referred to evidence that the complainant had given that she had been crying and put to her that he was caressing her and kissing her “before the sexual act began”. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I also say, on this entire story, that you left out completely, the details of the sexual act that actually, did take place even though those details are contained within your own statement. Would you look at your statement.” 
         
        
       
     47 In relation to this last count there was apparent reference to the occurrence in a later phone call which the appellant had with his brother (after he had been charged with offences) when he said, amongst other things “on the Thursday night I slapped her but she was very consenting with sex” (T973).  
      
       
     48 As already noted, the cross examination extended over many days but the above extracts suffice to demonstrate that, subject to dispute about the commencement date, details of the acts and consent, the appellant did not seek to join issue with the complainant that intercourse had taken place. He referred frequently to “relationship” and at times has mentioned the name of an American film producer whose then current marriage notoriously came to an end when he was discovered to be engaged in a sexual relationship with an adopted daughter of his wife. 
      
       
     49 Counts six to thirteen can be categorized differently from counts one to five for the purpose of assessing whether the appellant was disadvantaged by the absence of a Longman direction. No submission has been made by counsel now appearing which identifies any specific handicap visited upon the appellant in conducting his case on the issue of consent in relation to the latter counts which he contested. The details of the surrounding circumstances of the undenied intercourse, and critically whether consent was freely given, were on the case that the appellant was presenting within the exclusive knowledge of the participants. Insofar as the appellant sought to support his contentions by matters such as the appearance of the complainant, her continued participation in family and church group activity, the absence of overt distress and so forth, these were uninhibitedly and extensively canvassed by the appellant in his cross examination of the complainant.  
      
       
     50 It can be interpolated that, following the event giving rise to count thirteen, there was prompt complaint about it. The complainant testified that on the day following the offence she went to work and her employer made an enquiry about the appearance of her face. She replied in the negative but then spoke to a girlfriend whom she told that the appellant had hit her and raped her. This was on 28 October 1994. A Detective Frances Lynch came to the complainant’s place of work and saw her appearing upset and tearful. She was taken to the sexual assault clinic at Royal North Shore Hospital and seen by a social worker and a gynaecologist. Accompanied by a solicitor, the appellant attended upon Detectives Robertson and Lynch at Lane Cove Police Station on 13 December 1994 where he was charged. He was committed for trial in May 1995.  
      
       
     51 Counts one to four allege indecent assaults occurring respectively at Botany, Narrabeen, St Ives and Wahroonga between January 1987 and September 1989. The fifth count charges carnal knowledge of a daughter contrary to s73 of the Crimes Act on 7 June 1990 which was the complainant’s sixteenth birthday. Consent does not provide defence to a charge under that section if the victim is aged less than seventeen. The extracts of evidence set out above include the assertion by the appellant (T588) that the “first caressing” occurred in Halcyon Avenue in 1991 and it can be deduced that the appellant contends that the events described by the complainant in support of counts one to four did not happen and that no sexual intercourse took place on the complainant’s sixteenth birthday, and that no such intercourse took place until after she had attained her seventeenth birthday. 
      
       
     52 It is important however to consider that the Crown had also called a significant amount of “relationship” evidence going back to the complainant’s recollection of the earliest sexual dealing with her by the appellant in Emerald, Queensland in the mid 1980s. It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all of this evidence but its content was clearly designed and capable of adding force to the Crown’s case of inculpation of the appellant.  
      
       
     53 There is an obvious difference between disadvantage that might be perceived in seeking to support a denial of misconduct in increasingly distant past which is said not to have happened at all and disadvantage in seeking to support an assertion of consent to relatively more recent occasions of undenied sexual congress. 
      
       
     54 Applying the principles elucidated in Doggett, I conclude that the absence of a Longman direction in relation to the former category leads to an assessment that the jury did not receive needed assistance in respect of considerations of which they may not be aware and with which they may not be familiar, however, the same assessment should not be made in relation to those counts which are in the latter category.  
      
       
     55 It was submitted by the Crown that the Court should, in the event of reaching the conclusion which I first mentioned dismiss the appeal by application of the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I do not consider that appropriate to the circumstances and I would reject the submission. 
      
       
     56 The consequence of those views is that the convictions and sentences on counts one to five should be quashed and I would order a new trial in respect of them but the Court should proceed to consider the other grounds of appeal particularly as they pertain to counts six to thirteen. 
      
       
        
       The Absence of Legal Representation at Trial 
       
     57 Grounds 2, 3 and 5 are associated and can be dealt with together. It is the fact that the appellant represented himself at trial, that is to say, the trial which eventually took place. In assessing the appellant’s complaints it is instructive to make some observations of the events leading up to it. In this context the observation of the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Mahoney JA) in Attorney General for New South Wales v Milat 1995 37 NSWLR 370 @ 374 can be borne in mind: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is nothing in  
         Dietrich 
          to suggest that an indigent accused can be frustrate attempts to bring the accused to trial simply by rejecting offers of legal aid or other assistance. Mason CJ and McHugh J emphasized that the circumstances of each case need to be considered, and Deane J related the principle in question to denial of legal representation by reason of an accused’s lack of means and the unavailability of other assistance”. 
         
        
       
     58 Following committal for trial the appellant was arraigned in September 1995 and after listings hearings a trial commenced in June 1996 at which the appellant was represented by senior counsel. On the appellant’s application (through counsel) the jury was discharged in order to enable certain handwritten notes from the appellant’s brother to be examined and for counsel to take instructions about them. Between 1996 and 1998 four further trial dates were fixed. The appellant sought vacation of the trial dates on the basis of the need to resolve disputes between himself and legal aid authorities. On one occasion (in 1998) he informed the Court that he had withdrawn the instructions of the solicitor to whom the matter had been assigned by the Legal Aid Commission. In 1999 the appellant applied for a stay of proceedings “until the matter of legal representation is resolved”. This was heard by Christie DCJ. The managing solicitor of the Legal Aid Commission gave evidence and during his testimony pointed out that the appellant had never lodged an appeal against any refusal to grant him legal aid. His Honour refused the stay. A few days later a solicitor appeared before his Honour on a pro bono basis and, inter alia, informed him that an appeal had been lodged against the refusal to stay proceedings.  
      
       
     59 This appeal came before the Court (differently constituted) on 3 February 2000 and judgment was given on 8 February when the appeal was, by majority, dismissed: R v BK 2000 NSWCCA 4. A scheduled trial date had been fixed for 14 February 2000. Sully J remarked: 
      
       
        
         
         ”Having regard to what has passed previously between the appellant and the Legal Aid Commission, as supplemented by the fairly exiguous additional material that was placed before the Court in connection with any fresh application by the appellant for legal aid, it seems to me to be an overwhelming inference that the appellant either will not be granted legal aid at all; or will be granted legal aid upon such terms as are unacceptable to him. There seems to be an irreconcilable difference of view between the appellant and the relevant officials of the Legal Aid Commission as to the justification for the briefing of Senior Counsel rather than junior counsel to represent the appellant at his trial. It is, in my opinion, reasonable to infer also that there are irreconcilable differences of opinion between the appellant and the relevant officials at the Legal Aid Commission as to the way in which, and the basis upon which, the appellant’s case at trial should proceed.” 
         
        
       
     60 Carruthers AJ observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “Reduced to its simplest terms the issue of legal representation for the appellant reached a stalemate some considerable time ago. The matter cannot be resolved by the grant of legal aid at the instance of the Legal Aid Commission for three reasons. The appellant’s financial position is such that he does not qualify as eligible for a grant of legal aid because of the Commission’s means test criteria. Secondly, even if the means test could be satisfied the Commission would only grant legal aid for junior counsel to represent the appellant. This has always been unacceptable to him. Thirdly, there is an insuperable difficulty because of ethical matters, the detail of which it is inappropriate to expand upon at this stage. Those ethical problems could be resolved by the appellant but the mode of resolution is unacceptable to him. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand the appellant is not in a financial position to afford the quality of private representation (experienced senior and junior counsel) which he wishes to retain. 
         
        
        
         
         The only proposal which senior counsel appearing for the appellant before this Court was able to submit for the resolution of this problem was for the trial to be delayed for at least a further 18 months or two years to enable the appellant to obtain the necessary funds to finance appropriate private representation. 
         
        
        
         
         Such a proposal is, however unsupportable. It is now almost five years since the appellant was committed for trial on these serious charges, some of which relate to the period when the complainant was a child. Such further proposed delay in the trial is unacceptable. Secondly, in the light of the evidence as a whole, no court could have any degree of confidence on the present evidence that the appellant would be in a financial position to afford the quality of legal representation of which he speaks at any foreseeable time in the future.” 
         
        
       
     61 Smart AJ, in dissent, would have ordered the vacation of the trial date. His Honour observed that cash apparently available to the appellant and his wife would be required to meet taxation liabilities and having noted that they were conducting a business he referred to a proposal by the appellant that a long delay be granted in order to enable him to earn money to pay for private representation. His Honour spoke in alternative terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “It would not be beyond the Court’s power to require the applicant to set aside weekly amounts to meet his costs. If the moneys held by the wife are paid to the Taxation Department that may enable a fresh application for legal aid to be made.” 
         
        
       
     62 Nothing has been put forward to indicate that the appellant ever sought to implement his Honour’s suggestions.  
      
       
     63 In fact the trial did not proceed on 14 February 2000. A motion was filed seeking to postpone the trial principally on the grounds of the appellant’s alleged medical condition. On various days in February and March the matter was before Horler A/DCJ, Howie DCJ (as his Honour then was), Blanch CJ/DC and Dalgleish A/DCJ.  
      
       
     64 A trial date of 3 April was vacated but on 29 March 2000 the Chief Judge commented that it appeared that the appellant was seeking to avoid trial and it eventually commenced before Morgan DCJ and a jury on 1 May 2000. 
      
       
     65 In written submissions on behalf of the appellant reference is made to Dietrich v The Queen 1992 177 CLR 292 and it was submitted that “the fundamental prescript of the criminal law of this country is that no person shall be convicted of a crime except after a fair trial according to law”. There can be no dissent from that proposition but the decision is not authority for the implied assertion in this case that a trial conducted by the accused without legal representation was inevitably unfair. 
      
       
     66 Unfairness of this trial was sought to be stated by seven points expressed thus: 
      
       
     · “He did not have legal representation, 
      
       
     · His health prevented him from making correct decisions during the trial, 
      
       
     · The jury did not have the benefit of evidence from the appellant, 
      
       
     · The jury did not have the benefit of evidence from other witnesses called to support the defence case, 
      
       
     · Errors were made by the trial judge. 
      
       
     · All of the factors combined to bring about a miscarriage of justice.” 
      
       
     67 The first merely states an uncontested fact. Her Honour gave express advice and the appellant’s right to give evidence was well known to him as was his entitlement to call witnesses, although who these witnesses would be and what relevant evidence they may have given has not been articulated. I shall in due course deal with the grounds asserting error on the part of the trial judge. Apart from the statement in the grounds no other errors by her Honour are sought to be identified. The appellant’s health is the subject of separate grounds but it is correct that it would be appropriate to consider any matters of health in conjunction with the absence of legal representation, however that is not to say that any impediment whatsoever to health has necessary nexus to absence of legal representation with the consequence that it must be concluded that the trial was unfair. 
      
       
     68 Reference was made to s402 of the Crimes Act 1900 (now s96 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1980) which provides that “an accused person is entitled to make full answer and defence by counsel”. The purpose of reference is unclear but the provision in its terms neither mandates that an accused be provided with counsel at public expense nor that particular counsel or counsel of particular rank must be supplied. 
      
       
     69 Article 14(3) (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is set out in written submissions. It reads: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality: 
         
        
        
         
         ….. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it.” 
         
        
       
     70 That covenant is not part of applicable domestic law in New South Wales and it gives rise to no particular right vested in the appellant. The issue is whether the trial which has been conducted was unfair and neither the existence of the covenant nor its provisions determines the answer to that question.  
      
       
     71 This appeal was previously listed on 9 May 2001 before a court differently constituted (Hodgson JA, James and Adams JJ) when reference was made to affidavits which had been prepared in connection with the appeal, some of which had not then been served. In the circumstances earlier stated they, and the further affidavit of the appellant’s wife have been put before the Court. 
      
       
     72 The relevant content of the affidavit of the appellant sworn 7 June 2001 is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “2. I had intended to give evidence at my trial and this continued to be my intention well into the period of presentation of the prosecution case. However when the prosecution case concluded and it was time to present my defence my mental and physical condition was such that I felt incapable of giving a reliable account of myself. Consequently I elected to present no case. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In outline my answer to the charges laid against me was to be as follows: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) That at no time did I have any sexual nor intimate conduct in relation to the complainant, otherwise than with her full approval. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) I did not have sexual intercourse with the complainant prior to her reaching the age when she was enabled to give her consent.” 
         
        
       
     73 In relation to that affidavit the Crown has submitted that, given the limited scope of that intended evidence, particularly the complete failure to explain how and in what circumstances the appellant would say that the consensual relationship with his adopted daughter commenced, that evidence would have been of little benefit to the jury and predictably of less benefit to the appellant’s case. I agree with those comments. 
      
       
     74 I mentioned the absence of identification of intended witnesses. If it is intended to suggest that the appellant’s wife might have been called then it is pertinent to observe what happened when she was called during the sentencing proceedings. In cross examination she agreed that she had written letters to the complainant twice in November 1994 encouraging her to change her account of what happened and to withdraw her complaints. It is also difficult to see how it would materially assist the appellant’s case if it were revealed that he initially lied to his wife by claiming that sexual intercourse between himself and the complainant had happened only once when later he conceded to “an affair”.  
      
       
     75 In relation to grounds such as the present it is appropriate to look at the reasonableness of the conduct of the appellant in all circumstances: R v Kennedy 1997 94 A Crim R 341. Such observation should not, however, deflect from attention upon the central issue of whether the trial which has taken place can be perceived to have been unfair. It is appropriate to form a conclusion in the circumstances pertaining to the appellant’s health. 
      
       
        
       The Appellant’s Health 
       
     76 Grounds 4, 7 and 8 can be dealt with together. As already recorded the appellant sought postponement of the trial before it began on the grounds of his state of health. As accurately stated in the appellant’s written submissions, prior to and during the course of the trial numerous medical reports were tendered. In summary terms, it was put: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence that was before the Court was that the appellant was suffering from a severe blood viral infection. Subsequent testing, including blood testing, resulted in a specialist physician diagnosing the appellant as suffering from a non specific viral hepatitis.” 
         
        
       
     77 There were also available for reference results of numerous liver function tests. The issue is not to determine any precise clinical picture but whether the appellant was so affected by health problems that the trial should be categorized as unfair. The appellant’s treating general practitioner was Dr Andrew Pritchard Davies. He saw the appellant during the trial on 2 and 5 May. In a report of 8 May he suggested, and he suggested no more than, that the court should take into account the appellant’s condition when “setting days and sitting time”. He saw the appellant again on 1 June during the trial but did not expressly report in relation to this until afterwards.  
      
       
     78 It would be unnecessarily tedious to detail how comprehensively her Honour applied the doctor’s cautions. Counsel for the appellant has tabulated references to expressions of discomfiture by his client. On occasions the appellant said he was tired or that his memory was failing. A particular mention in this context was made of an intention to call his wife as a witness. Her Honour advised him that if that was the intent she should remain outside until called. I have made some observations about potential cross examination of her and will not repeat them. It might be mentioned in passing that this occurred prior to the calling of the complainant and a consequence was that she did not hear that evidence including the appellant’s cross examination. The delay followed, inter alia, the conduct of a Basha enquiry concerning some other Crown evidence. The appellant’s remarks need to be weighed with the medical material and the extent of accommodation suggested by it. The Crown submissions give some twenty three transcript references as examples of accommodations. At no time did the appellant, after the commencement, apply for the adjournment of the trial other than for limited periods and these were, when requested, granted. In the course of giving appropriate guidance to the unrepresented appellant this exchange occurred between him and the learned trial judge: 
      
       
        
         
         “HER HONOUR: Indeed, if you find at any time during the course of the trial ………….. that you need a break, you may raise that with me ……… should you fall ill during the trial the court will be adjourned until such time as it is a reasonable time that you are fit to be able to resume ……….. the court would require medical certificates in relation to anything that might extend more than a day. You understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I understand.” 
         
        
       
     79 Dr Pritchard Davies has sworn an affidavit on 27 February 2001 which also mentioned the occurrence of a poisoned foot which required removal of tissue and antibiotics treatment which would have added to the appellant’s “general debilitation”. This treatment occurred on 5 May 2000. In a post trial letter dated 28 August 2000 addressed to solicitors now acting for the appellant Dr Pritchard Davies wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “My opinion is that it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible, for (BKK) to adequately perform or concentrate adequately during his trial period because of the chronic and debilitating nature of his illness. After a chronic and debilitating illness it may often take months to regain full strength and condition that allows you to perform to the best of your ability.” 
         
        
       
     80 It is not a test of integrity of trial to consider whether an accused is performing to the best of ability. Many factors as well as health might affect attainment of the superlative. The issue is fairness of the trial and the capacity of the appellant as a factor in that, seen with the benefit of hindsight. 
      
       
     81 The absence of hindrance is forcefully demonstrated by two aspects of the appellant’s conduct of his case. First, he was able to put minute detail in cross examination and second, he was able to produce and utilize in that cross examination a prodigious quantity of documentation. 
      
       
     82 Examples of the first are his contentions concerning conversations, some of them extending back as far as 1979 to 1981; descriptions of food the family ate for dinner on the dates of particular alleged offences, pizza on 23 September 1989 and chicken and chips (with lollies) in January 1994; film videos watched identified by title on the occasion of the alleged offence at Bermagui and series of dates and times concerning the date of adoption, the complainant becoming an Australian citizen, the family leaving Fiji, the family leaving Emerald, staying at Botany Caravan Park, Narrabeen Caravan Park, speaking to the Head of TAFE, the holiday in Bermagui and the time the complainant arrived home on 30 September 1994.  
      
       
     83 Examples of the second included production of a family tree; books and pamphlets on sex education; an article from New Weekly magazine; school reports; fitness centre cards; learner driver’s licence; church rosters; photographs; greeting cards; lease agreements and other dated documentary records.  
      
       
     84 This topic should not be passed without mention that the Crown produced opinion from Professor McCaughan, Director of the A. W. Morrow Gastroenterology and Liver Centre who opined that it was not possible to make a diagnosis of “viral hepatitis” upon the evidence available, that it was possible that the liver blood tests were abnormal secondary to a general illness and that there was no evidence for a definitive diagnosis of the stated illness to be found. 
      
       
     85 There is a second aspect to considerations touching upon the appellant’s state of health. This is the suggestion that the appellant suffers from obsessive compulsive personality disorder and that a person suffering from such disorder should not conduct his or her own defence to criminal charges.  
      
       
     86 Dr Clark who has made this diagnosis describes the condition in these terms in a short letter dated 13 April 1999: 
      
       
        
         
         “This means that he becomes stuck in detail, lost in his perfectionism, such that he finds it difficult to complete tasks. He is pre-occupied so that the major point of many activities is lost. He is unable to work with others unless they submissively agree to his way of doing things.” 
         
        
       
     87 The only other material from Dr Clark is dated 17 July 2000 (post-trial) and states that the appellant is depressed and unable to organize his affairs properly and needs time to “complete his appeal”. 
      
       
     88 The Crown asked Dr Bruce Westmore another psychiatrist to consider the matter. In his report he emphasied that he did not see the appellant. Dr Westmore theorized that if Dr Clark’s diagnosis was correct then it is possible that such a disorder would adversely affect an individual’s ability to represent themselves, particularly in a long and complex trial. He suggested that a possible disadvantage would be an inability to identify or discern important issues from unimportant ones because of lack of legal background. Dr Westmore was also provided with information concerning the suggested viral illness and he expressed this opinion: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the final analysis in this particular case, I think the issue of his ‘fitness’ to conduct his own affairs is more related to physical medicine rather than psychiatric medicine. Having considered the documents and this matter, my final conclusion is that it would probably be unsafe to assume that this man could represent himself, to his best advantage, given his potentially physically debilitating disease and its impact on him both physically and from a psychological and psychiatric perspective. There is insufficient history of the psychiatric report of Dr Clark(e), that is insufficient detail of this man’s symptoms and how they might affect him in court to provide an opinion as to whether the diagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder played a primary role in any fitness alleged by this man. I note that Dr Clark(e) did not indicate that he was unfit to be tried from Presser perspective and a detailed description of his mental state, specifically a cognitive assessment was not described in Dr Clark(e)’s report of 8 August 2000. This further adds to the difficulties in expressing an opinion about whether the viral hepatitis was affecting this man’s attention and concentration and his memory functions.” 
         
        
       
     89 The ability of the appellant to give an account of himself in the sense of representing himself adequately so as to render the trial in which he participated not unfair can be judged not only from his abilities to cross examine but from his address to the jury which has been transcribed. The transcript of the appellant’s address extends over some sixty pages. In confirmation of what has been said in relation to counts six to thirteen the appellant referred to anguish and pain and added “the anguish and the pain is understandable and so is the anger because for any man such as myself to stand here and say to you I had an affair with my daughter is reprehensible, it’s abhorrent. I never denied it because that’s what I said.” (Extract transcript p2). 
      
       
     90 The instant question is whether the difficulties in thought process and articulation mentioned by Dr Clark have been manifest in this and other aspects of the appellant’s conduct of his defence. No point will be served by reproduction of the transcript of address but it shows an attempt (insofar as the evidence permitted it) to grapple with the strength of the Crown case and a collated and targeted expression of the assertions that the appellant advanced in cross examination. Insofar as complaints have since been made that the appellant was too exhausted at the end of the day to attend to transcripts it might be noted that at the end of address he commented upon the content of it and his understanding of the conventions of advocacy is illustrated by his final remarks namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “We’ve covered the issues of guilt. Therefore in totality, I’d like to say to you that in sum total, the evidence as a whole has not been substantiated by the case by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt according to the facts presented and then I ask you again, if yo can separate out the emotional from the objective criterias (sic) required to be put concerning the proven facts and substantive facts to support each criminal charge, I say the Crown has failed and the verdicts therefore must be not guilty. Thank you.” 
         
        
       
     91 An assessment of whether the trial has been unfair involves consideration of the foregoing matters in combination relating to both state of health and absence of legal representation. In my assessment the trial was not unfair and I would reject all of the grounds advanced. 
      
       
        
       The Name of the Victim (Ground 6) 
       
     92 An indictment, obviously erroneously, nominated the complainant’s twin sister as the victim in some counts. The transcript (pages 5 to 7) shows that the appellant was arraigned upon an indictment showing no such error and goes on to record that the Crown Prosecutor read a list of witnesses and the jury was then empanelled, presumably from a panel in waiting when the indictment would have been read. There is no substance in this ground. 
      
       
        
       Alleged Errors in the Judge’s Charge to the Jury 
       
     93 Grounds 9 to 13 inclusive identified various subject matters upon which her Honour is asserted to have erred but the grounds do not, as they should, identify the errors asserted. That said, the complaints encapsulated by the grounds can be dealt with seriatim in accordance with matters raised in submissions. 
      
       
     94 The first of these grounds related to her Honour’s directions to the jury concerning evidence of complaint. As already noted, complaint following the event giving rise to the thirteenth count was made after the complainant attended work on the following day. Counsel for the appellant referred to evidence given by the appellant’s wife after conviction including a version of the facts relating to complaint and it was contended that that evidence should have been before the jury. The Evidence Act assumes that members of the family of an accused person, including spouses, are compellable witnesses but compulsion is limited by express rights of objection vested by s18. Having regard to the appellant’s wife’s admissions of her attempts to persuade the complainant to vary her allegation or to withdraw it, I cannot perceive how the appellant can sensibly claim to have been disadvantaged by the absence of his wife from the witness box as a Crown witness.  
      
       
     95 As counsel for the Crown pointed out no precise error is identified in support of this ground. In the absence of such identification this ground cannot be sustained.  
      
       
     96 The next ground makes complaints in relation to directions concerning corroboration. To a large extent any complaint in relation to this has been dealt with in consideration of the application to this case of the principles stated in Doggett. In this case there was evidence capable of amounting to corroboration including the telephone conversation between the appellant and his brother and remarks to his sister in law and to the husband of the complainant’s twin sister. However, the appellant’s complaint should be dismissed in the light of the circumstance that, notwithstanding the express provisions of the Evidence Act in deleting former obligation to warn a jury about acting on uncorroborated evidence (s164(3)) the learned trial judge, although adverting to the potentially corroborating evidence, gave the jury instructions which included: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case stands or falls on the complainant’s evidence” 
         
        
        
         
         and 
         
        
        
         
         “The Crown case depends upon the complainant and must be scrutinized carefully” 
         
        
        
         
         and 
         
        
        
         
         “There are no witnesses to support the complainant to say they had witnessed the offences”. 
         
        
       
     97 Ground 11 relates to the appellant’s prior good character. Directions were given to the jury in this regard and the asserted deficiency is again not identified.  
      
       
     98 In cross reference to earlier grounds, it was submitted that the failure by the appellant to call positive evidence of good character was a major blunder inspired by his inability to represent himself. The value of such evidence would need to be assessed and three comments might be made: first, that there was no suggestion of anything adverse to the appellant other than the offences charged, second his own assessment of his behaviour was starkly sketched in the short passage from his address to the jury including adjectives “reprehensible” and “abhorrent” which is set out above and third her Honour gave the appellant express advice in this regard at the beginning of the proceedings. 
      
       
     99 Ground twelve referred to the appellant’s failure to give evidence. Reference is made to RPS v The Queen 2000 199 CLR 620 and Azzopardi v The Queen 2001 75 ALJR 931. The appellant’s submissions included a long list of suggested assistance which a judge might give to a jury concerning fact finding but such is not comprehended within the ground as expressed. The necessity for elaboration to the extent suggested is somewhat obscure. Her Honour had given conventional instructions on this matter and I do not perceive that more was required. Reduced to critical terms, the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt in relation to counts one to five that certain sexual actions occurred, the occurrence of which the appellant denied. In relation to counts six to thirteen, the Crown was required to prove the absence of consent to sexual congress between the appellant and the complainant, which congress was not in dispute.  
      
       
     100 Her Honour did give the jury instructions in relation to the absence of the appellant from the witness box but it can be observed that her directions were in language about which it was said in RPS that no complaint could be made.  
      
       
     101 Ground thirteen was sought to be supported by the absence from mention in the Judge’s charge to the jury of the circumstance that the Crown could have called the appellant’s wife to give evidence (subject to s18 of the Evidence Act). The argument in this regard is simply untenable. It was not the Crown case that the complainant had spoken to her mother and it adduced evidence from her explaining her failure to do so.  
      
       
     102 There was no comment made nor any identified suggestion of inference whereby her Honour invited the jury to consider that it could be expected that the appellant would call his wife as a witness. 
      
       
     103 None of these grounds have been made out. 
      
       
        
        
        
       Grounds Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen 
       
     104 These grounds relate to sentence. Having regard to the opinion already expressed concerning the outcome of the appeal in relation to counts one to five, the matter should be remitted to the District Court where sentence can be dealt with in accordance with the outcome of the new trial if it is held or, if prosecutorial discretion is exercised not to seek to retry those counts, sentence be reassessed and imposed in relation to conviction on counts six to thirteen only. 
      
       
     105 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (1) The appeal be allowed in part; 
        
       (2) The convictions and sentences on counts one to five of the indictment be quashed and a new trial ordered in respect of such counts; 
        
       (3) The sentences in respect of counts six to thirteen be quashed and the matter of sentence in respect of those counts remitted to the District Court to be dealt with according to law. 
        
       
     106 SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and with his reasons. 
      
       
     107 I wish to add some short observations of my own, which encapsulate why, in my view, the Longman v R direction was required in relation to certain of the counts and not in relation to others. 
      
       
     108 The rationale of the Longman v R direction appears to be that there is a special risk of the accused being wrongly convicted in a sexual offence case where the events occurred a long time ago. That, as explained in GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493 by Heydon JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ agreed), may be because the accused might not be able to obtain evidence or information which would have been available earlier (per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 90); or, in the case of a child complainant, because children are prone to fantasy which may be distinguished by contemporaneous questioning but which can harden into an absolute conviction of reality with the long passage of time (per Deane J at 100-101); or because recollection of events which occur in childhood is particularly susceptible to error and to the possibility that it may not even be genuine (per McHugh at 107-108). In relation to these considerations, as discussed in Longman, Heydon JA said, at [57]: 
      
       
        
         
         [I]t is impossible to escape from the conclusion that if delay causes either forensic prejudice to the accused in the particular circumstances, or risks of the type described by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R, a warning must be given. The passages which support that conclusion cannot be read down or evaded. 
         
        
       
     109 Once sufficient time has elapsed to be material in any such respect, the absence of a Longman direction will be excused only if special circumstances make the direction unnecessary. 
      
       
     110 Was there a sufficient lapse of time in this case to attract the prima facie need for such a direction? The offences were alleged to have occurred over the period 1987 to 1994. The earliest incident under counts 1 to 5 was in 1987, the most recent was on 7 June 1990. In relation to counts 6 to 13, the earliest incident was alleged to have occurred between 1 January and 31 March 1992, the most recent on 27 October 1994. The applicant was interviewed by police and charged on three counts in December 1994. He was committed for trial in May 1995. The materials before us do not disclose on which counts the appellant was charged in December 1994, nor on which counts he was committed for trial in May 1995. In these circumstances, insufficient time may have elapsed in relation to counts 6 to 13 before the appellant was apprised of those allegations. But a Longman direction was not required in relation to those counts for the reasons given by Grove J and in this judgment.  
      
       
     111 The position is different in relation to counts 1 to 5. In my view, the lapse of time was sufficient in relation to the later incidents in that series, even if the allegations were brought to the appellant’s attention as early as December 1994. It was unquestionably sufficient in relation to the earlier incidents in that series. So there was a prima facie requirement for the direction in relation to counts 1 to 5. 
      
       
     112 The special circumstances relied upon by the respondent, in the present case, as making the direction unnecessary, were (a), in relation to counts 6 to 13, that the only issue was consent; and (b), in relation to all counts, that the accused had demonstrated an unusual capacity for retrieval of detailed information about circumstantial situations and events. 
      
       
     113 There is substance in point (a). In view of the nature of the issue under counts 6 to 13, there was no serious possibility that extrinsic information, once existing but no longer available, might have made a difference to the outcome of the trial in relation to those counts. And the alleged acts relied upon under those counts occurred when the complainant was aged 17 to 20, so that the possibility of childhood fantasy did not arise. 
      
       
     114 By contrast, the issue in relation to counts 1 to 5 was whether the alleged acts had occurred at all. And they were alleged to have occurred when the complainant was aged 12 to 16. Much earlier acts were relied upon in support of these counts. The fact that a large amount of detailed information was available to the appellant at the trial does not dispel the risk that other information of importance might not have been, by reason of the passage of time. 
      
       
     115 These are the considerations which I would emphasise as distinguishing between the need for a Longman direction in relation to counts 6 to 13, and not in relation to counts 1 to 5.

     60792/00 Regina v Alan Mousallem 
     Judgment 
     1 SPERLING J: The applicant was born on 10 July 1967. He was imprisoned in relation to various offences from 6 December 1991 to 10 April 1998. The offences included armed robbery, supply of a prohibited drug (heroin), and being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited drug (heroin). When he was sentenced for supply of a prohibited drug, two similar offences were taken into account. 
     2 The offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited drug was a Commonwealth offence for which the applicant received a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years expiring on 10 May 1999. An appeal against that conviction and sentence was unsuccessful. The applicant was released on licence on 10 April 1998, some 13 months earlier than the expiry date for the non-parole period of six years. 
     3 On 5 November 1999 the applicant was arrested and charged with a further offence of supplying prohibited drug (heroin) on that day. The supply was constructive, the applicant having been found in possession of heroin and selling paraphernalia.  
     4 At that time, the applicant had been out of prison for a period of approximately 18 months. The non-parole period of six years in relation to the previous Commonwealth offence had expired but the head sentence of nine years had not. The applicant was still on liberty on licence in relation to that sentence. 
     5 The applicant pleaded not guilty to the new charge. Following a trial in the District Court he was convicted on 7 December 2000. 6 In his remarks on sentence, Freeman DCJ summarised the circumstances of the offence and the applicant's prior criminal history. He also noted that at the time of the offence the applicant was at liberty on licence. 
     7 His Honour referred to a report tendered on sentence being a report by Barbara Aldrich Psychological Services, which recorded the history of a disruptive, destabilising and psychologically damaging childhood and upbringing, including childhood exposure to the trauma of war in Lebanon. There was also a history of the applicant and his brother becoming separated from their parents after their arrival in Australia from Lebanon, and of the brother's untimely death. His Honour noted that the applicant did not give evidence on oath at the sentencing hearing in support of that history. It is apparent that his Honour was somewhat sceptical as to its reliability, as his Honour was entitled to be. Nonetheless, his Honour said that he was allowing some weight to the material and that, accepting it as an accurate picture, it provided some explanation for how the applicant came to be involved with drugs but no excuse for having engaged in the drug trade. That was a reasonable appraisal of the evidence concerning the applicant's personal history. 
     8 His Honour accepted that the process of psychological assessment which had occurred might improve the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. That was supported, to some extent, by the applicant having sought assistance within the prison system by way of psychological counselling and drug and alcohol counselling. His Honour noted, however, that Ms Aldrich predicted that the applicant's course of treatment would be difficult, prolonged, and subject to the likelihood of there being reversals and set backs. 
     9 His Honour imposed a sentence of eight years and 11 months commencing on 16 November 2000 with a non-parole period of four years and 11 months. His Honour revoked the licence under which the applicant had been released and sentenced the applicant to 12 months imprisonment in that regard to be served concurrently. (His Honour specified the latter period of imprisonment as being from 11 May 2000 to 10 May 2001, but it is common ground on the hearing of the appeal that that was a slip, and that his Honour intended to specify 11 May 2001 – being the date of sentence – to 10 May 2002.) 
     10 The sentence imposed by his Honour was effectively a sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of five years, taking into account a period of 26 days which the applicant had spent in custody shortly following his arrest on the present charge. His Honour backdated the sentence to 16 November 2000 notwithstanding that from that date to 4 December 2000 the applicant was in custody, bail refused, in relation to other matters (albeit matters for which there was never a conviction). 
     11 The non-parole period was substantially less than that provided for by the provisional statutory formula, his Honour having found special circumstances by reason of need for a prolonged period of supervision and treatment on the applicant's release from prison. Indeed, the departure from the provisional statutory formula was unusual in its extent, being approximately 60 percent of the head sentence by comparison with the provisional proportion of 75 percent. 
     12 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. The only ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In support of that ground of appeal it is observed on the applicant's behalf that the applicant was in possession of 14.5 grams of heroin which was 47.5 percent pure. That, it is pointed out, was towards the lower end of the range of quantities applicable to the offence for which he was convicted. It is said that a sentence of about two thirds of the maximum penalty of 15 years was disproportionate. That submission must be moderated by the consideration that both the head sentence and the non-parole period include the sentence of 12 months for breach of the licence. 
     13 An analogy was also sought to be drawn with the decision of this Court in Wong and Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340, where a range of five to seven years imprisonment was specified as a guide for the offence of importing a prohibited drug in the quantity of two to 200 grams. The proposed analogy takes no account, however, of the applicant's criminal history. 
     14 Counsel for the applicant has also referred the court to statistics kept by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. They indicate that, of 391 offenders sentenced for the relevant offence between April 1993 and December 2000, only three received a higher non-parole period or its equivalent, and only one received a higher head sentence. The statistics are informative but they do not, of course, constitute binding precedent. They include offenders with prior convictions, but they do not reveal the nature and extent of such prior convictions, nor the extent of penalties previously imposed. 
     15 The applicant's prior record is of particular importance. It includes very serious crimes, including armed robbery and offences of the same kind as that committed on this occasion. A prison sentence of nine years, of which the applicant served about five years, was insufficient to deflect the applicant from this pattern of behaviour. The applicant was on bail for an earlier supply offence when he committed the Commonwealth offence to which I have referred, and he was on licence when he committed the Commonwealth offence for which he was sentenced in this instance. 
     16 The applicant has displayed a complete disdain for the law and for the consequences of criminal behaviour for him, personally. That makes the prospect of rehabilitation very problematic indeed. There is a need for severe punishment in this case in the hope that this may cause the applicant to change his ways. The applicant's history also increases the weight to be given to protecting the community from a continuation of the same pattern of behaviour, although the penalty cannot, of course, be disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offence for which the applicant has been convicted and sentenced. 
     17 The sentencing judge had regard to all relative considerations relating to the objective circumstances of the offence for which the applicant was convicted and to the subjective circumstances relating to the applicant personally. An important feature of the sentence imposed is that it included the sentence of 12 months for the breach of licence so that, effectively, for the present offence, the applicant was sentenced to a head sentence of eight years and a non-parole period of four years. 
     18 Having regard to these considerations, the sentence imposed both in relation to the total sentence and the non-parole period was, as I assess it, a heavy one, but properly so and within the range of a proper exercise of judicial discretion. 
     19 I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal. 
     20 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. I only wish to add that having regard to the fact that the present offence was committed at a time when the applicant was on licence, it was appropriate, if not essential, that the sentence imposed for the new offence be cumulative upon the existing sentence. 
     21 The order of the Court will therefore be as Sperling J has proposed.

    13757/2001 – Alan George Micallef v Director of Public Prosecutions & AnorJUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The plaintiff, Alan George Micallef, is to face committal proceedings at the Burwood Local Court in respect of a charge of armed robbery with wounding. He is also charged with a number of related offences, which I need not mention. The first defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has the conduct of the prosecution. On 27 November last the plaintiff applied, under s48E(2)(b) of the Justices Act, for a direction requiring the attendance at those proceedings of one of the prosecution witnesses. By the terms of that provision, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that there were “substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence”. The second defendant, a magistrate, refused the application. 
     
      
    2 In this Court, the plaintiff seeks a declaration that his Worship erred in rejecting the application and an order that he reconsider the matter according to law. As is the usual practice, the magistrate has entered a submitting appearance. 
     
      
    3 The robbery is alleged to have been perpetrated by the plaintiff and a man named Vincent in the car park of a pharmacy at Chester Hill on the morning of 17 April 2001. It is the prosecution case that both men were armed with handguns and that, in the course of the robbery, the victim was shot in the leg. The robbers were observed to leave the scene in a van which had been stolen. 
     
      
    4 There was no identification evidence. However, DNA was detected on a baseball cap found at the scene. It proved to be the DNA of two persons but the major component was consistent with that of the plaintiff. About ten days later police searched a house at Mount Pritchard where, it is said, the plaintiff was living. A number of firearms were located, including a semi-automatic pistol which could be linked ballistically to the shooting of the victim of the robbery. There were also found documents belonging to the owner of the stolen van. 
     
      
    5 Statements were provided to the police by Ms Danielle Bonello, the plaintiff’s girlfriend, and it is she who was the subject of the s48E application. She told police that she had been living at the Mount Pritchard home with the plaintiff and that no one else lived there. She told the police officers conducting the search that there were firearms belonging to the plaintiff in the house. In particular, she said that shortly before the search the plaintiff had concealed two handguns which had been in a plastic bag in the lounge room. It was one of those, as I understand it, which was able to be linked to the robbery. She also identified the baseball cap found at the scene as the plaintiff’s. She stated that on the day of the robbery the plaintiff and Mr Vincent came to the house and the plaintiff said, “We done a robbery, a gun went off …”. 
     
      
    6 For the purpose of the application in the Local Court, the plaintiff’s solicitor, Mr Finlayson, provided written submissions. It seems that Ms Bonello was also a client of his, although in unrelated proceedings. The written submissions contained the following assertions: 
     
      
       
        
        Several months after the defendant’s arrest Ms Bonello advised me that the statements she had made to the police concerning the defendant were not correct and that she had only made such statements after she had been coerced and threatened by the police. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Bonello advised that if called to give evidence she would resile from her previous statements. 
        
       
      
    7 No evidence to that effect, from Ms Bonello or Mr Finlayson, was tendered. However, it appears that the prosecutor in the Local Court was content that the matter proceed in that informal way, although she pointed out in her written submissions that Ms Bonello had not provided any inconsistent statement to the police and, indeed, had not been able to be located so that the matters raised by Mr Finlayson could be canvassed with her. 
     
      
    8 In the course of his reasons for rejecting the application, the learned magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
        There is at this stage no document, no material, such (as) would indicate there is a potential, partial or total recantation in relation to either identification and or conversations. Essentially then the substantial reasons in the interest of justice would be an exercise as to whether the witness can offer an assurance she will live up to her evidence when called or alternatively, is she likely to modify any of her evidence. 
        
       
      
    9 His Worship went on to observe that the prosecution case was not restricted to Ms Bonello’s evidence and that the other material available to the prosecution represented “a strong case”. He concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        This Court cannot be satisfied that there are substantial reasons in the interest of justice for the direction to require for cross-examination the nominated witness, essentially to determine if she has had a change of heart since making her statements or to explore if any impropriety may have occurred in the taking of her statements … 
        
       
      
    10 With respect, these reasons do not appear to me to address the question which his Worship had to determine. The first passage quoted above suggests that his Worship was influenced by the fact that there was no evidence, particularly from Ms Bonello herself, to suggest that she might resile from the account she had given to the police. That is so, but there was before his Worship the statement of a solicitor that she had said as much to him. Although not on oath, Mr Finlayson’s statement in the written submissions was unchallenged and, clearly, worthy of acceptance. On the face of it, it raised a serious question about the reliability of Ms Bonello’s account to the police and pointed to the desirability of that account being tested in cross-examination. 
     
      
    11 His Worship then appears to have disposed of the application upon the basis that Ms Bonello’s evidence was not essential to the prosecution case and there was sufficient evidence against the plaintiff in the other material. Section 48E(2)(b) of the Justices Act was examined by the Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions v Losurdo (1998) 44 NSWLR 618. In that case (at 626-7) the Court quoted with approval a number of observations made about the provision by Studdert J in Hanna v Kearney (Studdert J, unreported, 28 May 1998). One of those observations was that it “would be wrong to limit ‘substantial reasons’ to situations where cross-examination is likely to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds for a no bill application”.  
     
      
    12 What his Worship was called upon to do was to assess the significance of Ms Bonello’s evidence and, in the light of what he had been informed by Mr Finlayson, to determine whether the interests of justice required her attendance for the purpose of cross-examination. The availability of other evidence tending to implicate the plaintiff, however persuasive it might be standing alone, was not determinative of that question. On the face of it, Ms Bonello’s evidence is of importance in the prosecution case and the proposition that there were substantial reasons, within the meaning of the subsection, for her attendance was clearly arguable. In my view, there was a constructive failure on the part of his Worship to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted to him: Acuthan v Coates (1986) 6 NSWLR 472, per Kirby P at 482. 
     
      
    13 Accordingly, prima facie, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which he seeks. However, those remedies are discretionary and the question remains whether this Court should decline to intervene. Mr Vincent has already been committed for trial and his trial is listed for 14 January next. The Crown wishes to proceed with the trial of both men on that date and, in the ordinary course, it is entirely appropriate that they be tried jointly. Ms Langley, for the Director of Public Prosecutions in this Court, submitted that the plaintiff is likely to be committed for trial on the evidence other than that of Ms Bonello, and that justice would be done if he had the opportunity at trial to examine her in the absence of the jury in accordance with the practice sanctioned in R v Basha (1989) 39 ACrim R 337. However, I respectfully agree with the observation of Hulme J in Dawson v DPP [1999] NSWSC 1147 (at para 25) that the “Basha Inquiry” is not “a substitute for the proper conduct of committal proceedings”. True it is that there is a significant circumstantial case against the plaintiff but I am not prepared to predict that, absent the evidence of Ms Bonello, he would necessarily be committed for trial.  
     
      
    14 In any event, the committal proceedings are listed for hearing later this week. It may be that the plaintiff’s s48E application could be reconsidered expeditiously, so that the proceedings could come to finality and, if committed for trial, the plaintiff could be put on trial with Mr Vincent in mid January. I appreciate that that timetable may be difficult to meet, particularly as it may be necessary for Mr Finlayson to withdraw from the matter. 
     
      
    15 I see no utility in making the declaration which the plaintiff seeks, as I have made my view clear in these reasons. However, I order that the matter be remitted to the learned magistrate to be determined according to law. If necessary, I shall hear the parties on costs.

      Remarks on Sentence 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Keith Andrew Schreiber, has pleaded guilty to the murder of Jack Van Krevel at his home in Albion Park in the early hours of Friday, 18 August 2000. 
    2 The offender was a longstanding friend of the deceased’s son, Mark Van Krevel, who is also known as Mark Valera. In July and August 2000 Valera was tried upon two counts of murder and found guilty. In that trial the deceased had given evidence in which he admitted that he had been physically violent to Valera, although he denied any sexual abuse. 
    3 The deceased was living at the house at Albion Park with his daughter, Belinda Van Krevel, and her two year-old daughter, Tia. The offender was friendly with Ms Van Krevel. Evidence as to whether their relationship was a sexual one is conflicting but I do not find it necessary to resolve that matter. What is clear is that he was strongly attached to her. Prior to the killing, Ms Van Krevel had told the offender that the deceased had interfered with her daughter sexually. There is evidence that she solicited the offender to kill the deceased, and she has since been charged with involvement in the murder. 
    4 The offender told Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist, that about two weeks before the killing, Ms Van Krevel had suggested to him “in a roundabout way” that he should kill the deceased. She asked him “hypothetically” if he would do it but he said that he would not. To what extent, if at all, Ms Van Krevel influenced his crime is a matter to which I shall return.  
    5 The offender himself had been the victim of violence and sexual abuse at the hands of a teacher when he was in primary school. He told Dr Westmore that he had been touched sexually by the deceased from time to time but, as he described these incidents, they appear to have been minor.  
    6 At the relevant time the offender was subject to a community service order which had been imposed following his conviction in the Wollongong District Court in September 1999 of a charge of armed robbery. For that purpose, he was under the supervision of Ms Rhonda Freestone, a Probation and Parole officer. In the early part of the year 2000, Ms Freestone arranged for him to attend courses in stress and anger management. However, from late July 2000 she noted a deterioration in his mood and presentation. Mark Valera’s trial was in progress at the time, and the offender himself was called as a witness in the Crown case. It was clear that he was finding the trial distressing and that, as Ms Freestone expressed it, he was “very angry at life in general”. His mood fluctuated between anger and depression. He expressed suicidal and homicidal thoughts, although the latter were not directed at anyone in particular. 
    7 When she first observed this deterioration, Ms Freestone asked the offender if he wanted to be referred to a counsellor. He said that he did not, that he had to deal with things himself and that he would not take any charity. About a week later Ms Freestone was sufficiently concerned to refer him to a psychologist, but he did not keep the appointment. By 14 August 2000 there had been a further significant deterioration. He told Ms Freestone that he had not eaten and had slept badly for several days. By this time Mark Valera had been found guilty and was in custody. The offender had been sharing premises with him and, as a result, he was homeless.  
    8 By 15 August, only a matter of days before the killing, his presentation was such that Ms Freestone contacted the Mental Health Mobile Treatment Team of the Illawarra Area Heath Service. Among other things, he spoke of his belief that little Tia was being sexually abused in her home and expressed concern for her welfare. Ms Freestone said that he spoke of this “as if it was a very personal hurt”. The Mental Health Team had him assessed by a staff psychiatrist at Wollongong Hospital, who found no evidence of mental illness such as to justify his being detained under the Mental Health Act. The doctor concluded that he was “a long term risk of harm to self and others”, but he did not see him as an “immediate risk”. 
    9 It is against this background that the terrible events of the morning of 18 August might be understood. The offender went to the deceased’s home and obtained a tomahawk which was hanging up on the outside of the garage. He entered the house by climbing through an unlocked window. He went to the kitchen and obtained a large knife. He then went to a bedroom where the deceased was sleeping, naked. The deceased woke and he struck him on the head with the tomahawk, holding it with both hands. As the deceased rolled to the centre of the bed, calling out in protest, the offender continued to strike him with the tomahawk. He tried to cut his neck with the knife and to stab him in the heart but, as the bedroom light was off, he was finding it difficult to see.  
    10 The deceased rolled off the bed. The offender ran to the lounge room, where he seized a brass-handled poker from near the fireplace. He returned to the bedroom and turned on the light. The deceased was kneeling at the side of the bed and called to him by name. The offender said, “This is from Mark, fucking paedophile bastard. You’ll never molest another kid again.” He then struck the deceased in the neck, first with the poker then several times with the tomahawk until he heard the neck crack. He took up the knife and cut the deceased’s neck to expel air from his airways. He also cut the deceased’s right leg, down the length of his spine, on the cheeks of his buttocks and around the anus. Although  
     
      
     his intention by doing so was to inflict pain, the post-mortem findings indicate that the deceased was dead by then.  
      
    11 The forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem detected twenty-five chop wounds to the head and neck, with the neck partly severed. There were also numerous stab wounds and lacerations on the torso.  
    12 The offender was arrested that afternoon in the Albion Park area. Initially, he gave a false name and claimed to have no knowledge of the murder. Later, however, he admitted the killing in a recorded interview at Port Kembla police station and participated in a video taped “runaround”. It is from his detailed admissions that the narrative of the killing in these reasons, drawn from the Crown’s comprehensive statement of facts, is derived. 
    13 The offender was twenty-one years old at the time of the murder and is now twenty-two. Apart from the armed robbery to which I have referred, the only other entry on his criminal record is a matter which was dealt with without a conviction being recorded and which can be disregarded. I have no details of the robbery, apart from the fact that it was committed in the company of Mark Valera, but the outcome suggests that it was not a particularly serious offence of its class. 
    14 He was brought up in Wollongong, and it seems that his family life was satisfactory until his parents divorced when he was twelve years old. He was greatly distressed by this development, for which, for no rational reason, he felt responsible. Included in a body of evidence from relatives about his background is a helpful and perceptive statement by his aunt, Ms Laveana McNamara. She wrote that his self-esteem, which had been low from a very young age, deteriorated. Both parents re-married, but he was not welcomed by either of their new partners.  
    15 In these circumstances, the offender became increasingly dependant upon the friendship of Mark Valera, which led to his relationship with Belinda Van Krevel. It is clear from her statement that Ms McNamara considers both of them to have been a malign influence upon him. For a period the offender was living with his sister, Annette and her partner and was attempting to get his life in order whilst he was performing community service. However, they also disapproved of his association with Mark and Belinda and were concerned about what they observed to be his dependant relationship with both of them.  
    16 Some further light is thrown upon the offender’s crime by this background. It is clear that at the time of the killing he was in a disturbed mental state, engendered in large part by his preoccupation with the abuse which he believed the deceased had visited upon Mark Valera and the child, Tia. He himself, as a child, had been the victim of physical and sexual abuse by a teacher. I have referred to his account to Dr Westmore of inappropriate sexual contact by the deceased, but that appears to be of little significance for present purposes.  
    17 To what extent the killing was the result of the urging of Ms Van Krevel is difficult to determine. I must consider that matter upon the limited material before me, bearing in mind that criminal proceedings against her are now in train. Anything I say about it is for the purpose only of assessing the offender’s criminality and, obviously, could not pre-empt the finding of a court dealing with her. In evidence, Dr Westmore expressed the view that, when the offender said that she had raised the matter of killing the deceased with him “hypothetically”, he was being “less than complete” in his account of her involvement. It is sufficient to say that I share that view. Whatever her particular role might have been, I am satisfied that to a significant degree the offender’s actions were the result of her influence. 
    18 He told Dr Westmore that his intention had been to hurt the deceased, to scare him and to force him to confess his wrongdoing. He added that he did not expect it “to go that far.” However, I am satisfied that he intended to kill the deceased. No other conclusion is available from the nature of the attack and from what he told police in the recorded interview. Indeed, he told the interviewing police that that was his purpose in going to the house. However, this is not to deny his disturbed state of mind at the time. The manner of the killing, including the fact that it was perpetrated with implements found at the house, is inconsistent with cool deliberation and planning.  
    19 Dr Westmore saw the offender on three occasions this year. He described him in his first report as “an extremely troubled individual”, a view consistent with the findings of Ms Katherine Barrier, psychologist, who also assessed him. Dr Westmore could arrive at no firm diagnosis, but his provisional diagnosis was a severe personality disorder and he considered him to be in need of long term psychotherapy. In consultations with Dr Westmore the offender expressed remorse for his crime, although the doctor noted that it was directed towards the deceased’s family rather than the deceased himself. The attitude he expressed about the deceased was that, if he had been a paedophile, he should have been imprisoned but did not deserve to die.  
    20 Dr Westmore described the offender’s prognosis as “most uncertain”, and was not prepared to express an opinion about whether he remains a danger to the community. He was concerned that the offender might be a risk to paedophiles, given that he had expressed strong feelings about them during the consultations, saying that he considered sexual abuse of children to be more serious than murder.  
    21 On the other hand, Dr Westmore acknowledged in oral evidence that there are hopeful signs for the future. The offender told the doctor that he got into fights occasionally and often entertained thoughts of a violent kind. However, this is not the personality described in the evidence of the relatives to which I have referred, which paints a picture of a kind and affectionate young man who was not observed to be violent or ill-disciplined. He did not fare well at school and left before completing year 10. However, he had a satisfactory employment history, albeit in unskilled work. His brief criminal record does not disclose a violent propensity. He appears to have met his obligations under the community service order satisfactorily and, except for the period immediately prior to the killing, to have been amenable to the assistance and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service. 
    22 In my view, the offender’s crime is explicable by his relationship with Mark Valera and Belinda Van Krevel and his personal circumstances at the time. Having given the matter careful consideration, I am not persuaded that he is a continuing danger to society. Indeed, if he has the benefit of the psychotherapy recommended by Dr Westmore, I have some confidence that he will not re-offend in a violent way. His expression of remorse to Dr Westmore, while not as complete as one might wish, demonstrates an insight into the enormity of his crime. I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, particularly as he will enjoy the continuing support of members of his extended family. 
    23 That said, this was a most brutal killing and its objective gravity demands a heavy sentence. I have received a statement by the deceased’s brother, writing for himself and on behalf of members of the family, which describes in a moving way the impact upon them of their loss. The approach of the Court to such a statement has been settled since the decision of Hunt CJ at CL in Previtera (1997) 94 ACrim R 76. Nevertheless, I think it appropriate that I should express my deepest sympathy to the family as, I am sure, would any member of the community. I have referred to the offender’s belief that the deceased was a paedophile, because that belief is relevant to an assessment of the criminality of the murder. However, nothing I have said should be interpreted as a finding that that belief was well founded. To pass judgment upon the deceased is no part of my function in this sentencing exercise. 
    24 The offender pleaded guilty at his arraignment in this Court, which the Crown accepts to have been the earliest reasonable opportunity. He is entitled to the benefit of that plea, both for its utilitarian value and for the extent to which it demonstrates his remorse. Whatever might be the current status of guideline judgments such as R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, I think it appropriate to indicate in a general way the measure of leniency which that plea has earned him. But for it, I would have sentenced him to something in the order of twenty years imprisonment. In the light of it, the sentence I propose is sixteen years.  
    25 Clearly, the offender would benefit from a lengthy parole period. However, the application of the usual statutory proportion between head sentence and non-parole period would yield a non-parole period of twelve years, with the opportunity of conditional liberty for four years. I think that that period would be adequate to consolidate his rehabilitation, and the gravity of the crime is such that I do not believe that I could fix a non-parole period of less than twelve years. He has been in custody since his arrest on 18 August 2000. 
    26 Keith Andrew Schreiber, you are sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years, to date from 18 August 2000, with a non-parole period of twelve years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 18 August 2012.

    REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 His Honour: On her arraignment in Grafton on 26 November 2001 the prisoner pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to the manslaughter of her five year old son, Dylan Byrne. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment and I was informed from the Bar table that the plea was tendered on the basis of criminal negligence but accepted by the Crown on the basis of death resulting from unlawful and dangerous acts. Evidence was taken in Grafton on 27 and 28 November and adjourned to Sydney for the taking of medical evidence. Upon resumption in Sydney on 4 December I was informed that it was now conceded that the death resulted from unlawful and dangerous acts on the part of the prisoner. 
     
      
    2 The child was brought to the emergency ward at Grafton Base Hospital at about 9.20 am on Wednesday, 5 July 2000 in a comatose state. His skin colour was abnormal and mottled with a cyanosed bluish red appearance, he was not breathing or circulating blood adequately, and his body temperature was 28.9 degrees Celsius. There was also a significant area of red discolouration on his left leg and the appearance of bruising across the front of his head. Despite their best endeavours, the medical staff was unable to revive him and he was pronounced dead at 10.55 am. Meanwhile the hospital staff discovered a number of other bruises on his arms, legs and trunk and, when they turned him over after ceasing their efforts to revive him, they found a large excoriated area on his back, which looked like a burn. The marks and injuries appear on the photos attached to the statement of Det Sen Cons McFarlane and also in Exhibits 1 and 4.  
     
      
    3 The post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr Botterill whose findings included an extensive severe scald of the back in a pattern consistent with immersion in hot water, probable scalds over the left arm and leg, many bruises of varying age over the head, trunk, arms and legs, grazes over the right cheek, right knee, fine red bruises over the lining of the left eye, a fingernail-like mark over the right side of the neck, excess fluid in the lungs, probable inhaled blood in the lungs, small shallow ulcers of the lining of the stomach, blood in the bowel and next to the pancreas and a swollen brain. There was also an infection of the lungs, most probably related to a recent viral infection.  
     
      
    4 He identified the cause of death as the combined effect of multiple injuries (scald on the back and extensive bruising) and bronchiolitis (a viral infection of the smaller windpipes in the peripheral areas of the lungs). He regarded the bronchiolitis as less significant than the injuries. Dr Ryan, a consultant paediatrician, who also attended the post-mortem examination, said in evidence that death from bronchiolitis in a child the age of Dylan would be extremely rare, and I am satisfied that such condition played only a minimal, if any, part in the death of this child. The substantial issue debated during the proceedings on sentence related to the nature of the burn on the victim’s back. 
     
      
    5 The prisoner gave a number of different versions as to how the deceased met his injuries. Initially she said she had put him in a bath which was “sort of warm”, whilst she explained the red area on his legs and the bruising across his head by saying that he had fallen off a swing the previous day, and later she said that the previous evening he had lain in front of the fire and got too close to it, so that his back started getting red, the next morning he was shaking so she put him in a warm bath, left him for 10 minutes, came back and he was unconscious.  
     
      
    6 Later on the same day, 5 July, she took part in two video recorded interviews, in the latter of which she admitted she had put the bruises on him by hitting him all over the body and head with a plastic spoon (which later became Ex. H). She said she had just “lost it” and continually hit him while he was in the shower for about 20 minutes, that she had hit him so much on the legs that he could not walk and could not get out of the shower himself, and when she took him out he was crying but not talking, his eyes were open and he was breathing. She said she placed him down in front of the fire and wrapped a cold wet blanket around him, but his back got red so she moved him back onto a small lounge divan and left him there.  
     
      
    7 She said she realised he needed medical treatment, but did not take him to the hospital because she was scared the authorities would “lock her up” and take her daughter, Melissa, then aged 15 months. She later put a bandage round his back and some cream on it, but otherwise left him all night on the lounge naked and uncovered. She said that on the Wednesday morning he was complaining that he was cold and wanted to be warmed up, so she ran him a luke warm bath, left him in it for about 10 minutes whilst she changed her daughter’s nappy, and when she went back he was not moving and there was blood coming out of his nose. Attempts by Elwyn Morris, an adult male living in the house with her at the time, to revive him by mouth to mouth resuscitation failed, so they took him to the hospital. 
     
      
    8 She requested to see the police again on 27 July when she told them a different story in which she attempted to shift a large part of the blame onto Elwyn Morris, but this version may be disregarded because it obviously followed a falling out between the prisoner and Elwyn Morris: see in particular Q & A 111. 
     
      
    9 In a further interview with police on 13 August 2000, when her attention was drawn (Q 125) to the medical opinion by then received that the burn on the back was not from an open fire but from scalding with a hot liquid, probably water, the prisoner said that Elwyn must have done it, that she would not scald her own son, and he must have done it the night before or when she was out at the shops on the Wednesday morning. She agreed she ran a bath for Dylan on the Wednesday morning, but insisted it was a “warm”, not “hot”, bath. 
     
      
    10 At some stage, presumably before she made the statement of 27 July, she wrote an undated letter to Elwyn Morris telling him what she had told the police, apparently with a view to him telling the same story, and excluding Elwyn from any involvement or responsibility. It is substantially consistent with the version she gave in the second recorded interview of 5 July. The letter concludes “I know I told a few lies elwyn but it’s only cause I love you, elwyn … we know what really happen but there not going to believe us elwyn.” (sic) 
     
      
    11 She was seen by Dr Robert Delaforce, forensic psychiatrist on 20 November 2001 for the purpose of him providing a report. In that consultation she gave a version which, although differing in some details, was largely consistent with that given in her second recorded interview of 5 July. She said that after Dylan was moved out of the shower he never talked and, although his eyes were open he did not seem to know what was going on. He had nothing to eat or drink that night. She wanted to take him to the hospital, but Morris said to leave it until the next morning.  
     
      
    12 The Crown called Elwyn Morris on the sentencing hearing, and although he was in many respects an unsatisfactory and unconvincing witness, his version of events on the Tuesday was also substantially the same as that given by the prisoner in her second recorded interview of 5 July 2000 and in her consultation with Dr Delaforce. 
     
      
    13 As was her right, the prisoner gave no evidence on sentencing and the ascertainment of what actually happened has not been without difficulty, but I am satisfied that the versions given in the second recorded interview of 5 July 2000, and in the consultation with Dr Delaforce in November 2001, corroborated as they are to a degree by the evidence of Elwyn Morris and being consistent with the injuries and bruises (except the burn on the back) are substantially true, and can be relied on to establish what happened up until about 7 pm on the evening of Tuesday, 4 July. However, I do not accept that the burn to the back was a radiant burn sustained from lying too close to the open fire, but am satisfied to the criminal standard that it was a scald burn occasioned by the child being immersed on his back in a bath containing very hot water. 
     
      
    14 All the medical witnesses (including Dr Maitz, called on behalf of the prisoner) expressed a preference for it being an immersion caused scald having regard particularly to the clear definition of the extent of the burn mark, although a number of them were prepared to concede, generally with reluctance and then only to a limited degree, the possibility of it being a radiant burn.  
     
      
    15 Dr Martin would not concede the “practical possibility” of the burn being a radiant burn and was firmly of the view, not only that it was a scalding burn but also that the lighter patch indicated an area of more extensive burning rather than of sparing, and this provided further support for his view that it was an immersion burn consistent with the child being placed in a bath of hot water. 
     
      
    16 They all agreed that for the child to suffer the radiant burn in front of the fire as claimed, he would need to be unconscious or virtually so because as a five year old he would have moved away as it got hot. Dr Martin drew attention to the fact that to cause the burn the heat would need to be in the range of 43 to 45 degrees Celsius. 
     
      
    17 Although he tended to be somewhat dogmatic in his demeanour, I found the evidence of Dr Martin the most convincing. He has had the most extensive experience of the doctors giving evidence in dealing with burns injuries to children, and he described the clearly defined borders of the injury as a “classic case of an immersion scalding injury”. I also found his explanation for the lighter coloured area in the middle of the burn area as an area of deeper more acute burn, rather than as an area of sparing, convincing.  
     
      
    18 I accept the admissions made by the prisoner, corroborated by the sworn evidence of Mr Morris, that on the afternoon of Tuesday, 4 July the prisoner struck the child repeatedly with the plastic spoon whilst he was standing under a cold shower and struck him so hard that on at least three occasions he fell to the ground, and then was left in the bathroom, naked, for some hours until about 7 pm and that he was then unable to walk and was either unconscious, sub-conscious or at least drowsy. I am also satisfied that by that stage, his body was very cold and he was probably suffering hypothermia.  
     
      
    19 I am further satisfied that at that stage, realising he was cold and not responding, instead of taking him to the hospital for proper treatment she then or later, in an effort to warm him up, placed him in an overheated bath, thereby occasioning the substantial burn to his back. Having burnt him in this way, she still refrained from taking him to the hospital for fear of the consequences for herself; and did not do so until after the child was dead. He must have been still alive when the burns were sustained, although possibly unconscious; but having regard to his body temperature on arrival at the hospital, he had by then been dead for some hours. 
     
      
    20 The many bruises found on the child’s body at post-mortem were described as being “of varying age”, and I am satisfied that the injuries which contributed to his death were not all inflicted the previous day but over a number of days, and that they were all inflicted by the prisoner, as it seems Elwyn Morris did not interest himself in the discipline or care of the children, and there is no evidence that he was responsible for any beatings of Dylan. 
     
      
    21 The vicious beating of the child and then leaving him in the cold bathroom naked in the middle of winter for some hours constituted unlawful and dangerous acts which contributed to his death, his immersion in overheated water, and the failure to seek medical help after the assault when he was removed from the bathroom cold and unable to walk, and again after he sustained the burn each constituted acts of criminal negligence, although it appears that the immersion in overheated water was an attempt to revive the child and not done with intent to cause further harm. 
     
      
    22 The injuries inflicted on this poor unfortunate child were brutal and extensive and must have caused him considerable pain and distress in the last days and hours of his life; and what aggravates the criminality involved is that these injuries came from his own mother, the person from whom above all he was entitled to expect care, nurture, love and protection. 
     
      
    23 The plaintiff was born on 17 February 1968 and is now aged 33 years. She was the youngest of ten children born to parents who were, and remain, married. She grew up in the western suburbs of Sydney and later on the Central Coast. 
     
      
    24 She claims to have been molested when young and on occasions suffered bruising when her mother disciplined her with a spoon. One brother has been in prison although there is no evidence of the nature of his offence, another is schizophrenic and a sister has had in-patient psychiatric treatment. 
     
      
    25 She attended school until part way through Year 9, leaving with limited literacy skills, although these have apparently improved in the meantime, and she has been unemployed for most of her time since leaving school. At the age of 16 she was raped by three males who were subsequently convicted and imprisoned, and she was also injured in a motor vehicle accident. She received compensation both for the rape and the motor vehicle accident, but the money was dissipated. 
     
      
    26 She has never been married or engaged, but has had a number of de facto relationships, the first commencing when she was about 18 or 19 years old with Elwyn Morris with whom she went to Lightning Ridge. Different accounts are given of this relationship which was apparently intermittent over a number of years. She claims she was subjected to physical and sexual abuse, all of which is denied by Morris, who claims that she frequently left him for other men, but he repeatedly took her back. The relationship broke down after about 7 or 8 years.  
     
      
    27 She then returned to the Central Coast where she had a relationship with Glen Page who was the father of the children, but also a heavy drug user who had suffered permanent brain damage as a result of a motor vehicle accident when a child. This appears to have also been an abusive relationship to which his parents were opposed. 
     
      
    28 During breaks in her relationship with Page she had relationships with two other men; one drank to excess and the other was subsequently imprisoned for the sexual assault of young females. Then Glen Page reappeared temporarily, with the result that the prisoner became pregnant with Melissa, whereupon Page left and he has played no further part in her life or that of either of his children.  
     
      
    29 In early 2000 she moved to Urunga where her brother was living, but after she sent Morris a card for his birthday he reappeared on the scene and invited her and the children up to Guranang near Grafton to stay at his mother’s place, which she did, and he then moved her back to Urunga. Following a disagreement with her brother the prisoner went to stay with a friend, Lesley Howard, at Coffs Harbour for about a month where Morris visited her a number of times, and then about two weeks before Dylan’s death he helped her move into rented accommodation she had found at Mary Street, Grafton where he appears to have spent most of his time, although he claimed he was still living with his mother and step father in Guranang and only visiting the prisoner at Mary Street. The prisoner appears to have regarded this as the renewal of a romantic relationship, but I am satisfied that Morris did not see it in that light, but merely as a convenient (and probably transient) arrangement for sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    30 Over the last 2 to 3 years Dylan had become a difficult child to manage and the prisoner had attempted to discipline him by hitting him with the plastic spoon, yelling at him and constantly telling him he was a naughty boy, all of which seems to have been counter productive, and only compounded the problem. In addition, whilst at Coffs Harbour she felt that Dylan preferred Ms Howard to her, and that she was inadequate as a mother. 
     
      
    31 About a week before Dylan’s death, Morris, the prisoner and Ms Howard had together gone to the Department of Community Services office in Grafton to seek help for the prisoner in dealing with Dylan, but she had declined to make an appointment. 
     
      
    32 Over a number of years she had drunk alcohol to excess and also used cannabis and amphetamines, but during her time in Grafton she was not drinking alcohol or using amphetamines, although she was continuing to use cannabis.  
     
      
    33 Dr Delaforce diagnosed her as suffering at the time from mild social phobia, and a number of personality disorders namely, avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. He also found that since, and as a result of, Dylan’s death she has suffered a major depressive disorder and a post traumatic stress disorder. 
     
      
    34 Her IQ was assessed by Ms Barrier, a clinical psychologist, at a score of 75 which would place her in the borderline intellectual functioning range, although Dr Delaforce noted that her presentation during the audio tape recording of the interviews with police and her presentation to him during his consultation suggested better intellectual functioning. 
     
      
    35 I accept Dr Delaforce’s diagnosis and also his opinion that she will require ongoing treatment for a lengthy period in the future. This suggests the need for a longer, rather than a shorter, period of supervision on her release from full time custody, and constitutes special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    36 She has pleaded guilty to manslaughter at what I am satisfied was the earliest time at which such option was practically available, although that was only a week before the trial. The plea of guilty recognises an acknowledgment of guilt and demonstrates remorse which she has previously expressed to Dr Delaforce, although in view of her admissions to police, I consider it was a strong Crown case. 
     
      
    37 The plea also has a utilitarian value in saving the cost and expense of a trial, in this case expected to last 2 to 3 weeks. However, the evidence on sentence extended over 4 days, although they were not full days, and involved the calling of one lay and six medical witnesses. The plea was initially entered on the basis only of criminal negligence in not taking the child to the hospital earlier, and it was only after Mr Morris’ evidence had been completed that her counsel informed me (T 97) that unlawful and dangerous act (the assault under the shower in the bathroom) was conceded, and there was still no admission which I could accept concerning the burn to his back. 
     
      
    38 The prisoner is not to be penalised for exercising her right to silence, but the utilitarian value of the plea was not as great as it could have been, and therefore the reduction in sentence is not as great as it would have been if she had at some stage told the Court how the child sustained the immersion burn which I am satisfied he suffered. In the circumstances I have allowed a reduction in the sentence on account of her plea of 15%. 
     
      
    39 Whilst the offence of manslaughter is always serious as it involves the unlawful killing of another human being, the Court regards the killing of children as particularly serious, especially when such killings are at the hands of a parent or family member.  
     
      
    40 In a number of cases the Courts have stressed the need for both general and personal deterrence in such cases, and consistently heavy sentences have been imposed: Vaughan (1991) 56 A Crim R 355, Ditfort (NSWCCA 17 March 1992) and Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309. 
     
      
    41 I have had regard to the sentences imposed in the abovementioned cases and also to those imposed in Dawney (Barr J – 15 September 1999), Bilton [2000] NSWSC 1113, Recalde [2000] NSWSC 1247, Murdoch (CCA 10 Dec 1998), Wilkinson [1999] CCA 248, Hill [2001] NSWSC 978, and Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 as providing a broad guide to the range of sentences imposed in such cases, bearing in mind that the circumstances of each offence and the subjective features of each offender are different.  
     
      
    42 In some of the cases referred to the offender was the de facto spouse of the victim’s parent, as opposed to the mother herself as in this case, in most of them the offender had pleaded guilty, some offenders had personality disorders of various kinds, and in many, if not most, cases there was a need to serve the sentence on protection. In this case there is now evidence that the prisoner was held in protective and segregated custody from 6 July 2000 until 3 December 2001, but is now being held in the MSU – general population section. The sentence will be backdated to take account of her pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
       
       
      
    43 Suellen Lynn Byrne for the manslaughter of Dylan Byrne I sentence you to imprisonment for 8½ years such sentence to be deemed to have commenced on 5 July 2000 and expire on 4 January 2009. I fix a non-parole period of 6 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 4 July 2006.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 MASON P: The appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. He was tried in the District Court in November 2000 before Judge Gibson and a jury. The indictment charged certain counts in the alternative. Since, however the appellant was convicted on all of the primary charges it is sufficient if they are set out: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1 
         : For that he between 1.1.80 and 31.12.80, did indecently assault the first complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2 
         : For that he around March 1983 did indecently assault the first complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 3 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 30.6.83 did indecently assault the first complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 4 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 31.12.83 did indecently assault the first complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 5, 7 and 9 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 31.12.83 did have sexual intercourse with the first complainant without his consent (s61D(1) now repealed  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 10 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 6, 8 and 10 
         :  
         In the alternative to Counts 5, 7 and 9 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 31.12.83 did indecently assault the first complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 11 and 13 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 26.11.83 did have sexual intercourse with the second complainant without his consent (s61D(1) now repealed  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 10 years). 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 12 and 14 
         :  
         In the alternative to Counts 11 and 13 
         : For that he between 1.2.83 and 26.11.83 did indecently assault the second complainant (s81  
         Crimes Act 1900 
         . Maximum penalty 5 years).  
         
        
        
       
     2 On 21 December 2000 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of nine years, this being for: 
      
       
        
         
         Counts 1-4: 2 years imprisonment, commencing from 14 November 2000 and expiring 13 November 2002. 
         
        
        
         
         Counts 7-9: 3 years imprisonment, commencing from 14 November 2000 and expiring 13 November 2003. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 11: 3 years imprisonment commencing from 14 November 2000 and expiring 13 November 2003. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 5: 5 years imprisonment commencing from 14 November 2000 and expiring on 13 November 2005. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 13: 4 years imprisonment commencing from 14 November 2005 and expiring 13 November 2009. 
         
        
        
         
         A non-parole period on the full sentence of 6 years 9 months commencing from 14 November 2000 and expiring 13 August 2007. 
         
        
       
     3 The two complainants were brothers. The first (CD) was born on 15 March 1969. He was 31 when he made complaint about events said to have occurred when he was aged between 10 and 14. The second complainant (RD) was born on 26 November 1967. He was 32 when he made complaint about events said to have occurred when he was aged 15. 
      
       
     4 At the relevant times the two complainants were students at a college in a suburb of Sydney. The appellant taught there between 1979 and 1982. He was a brother in a religious order. In 1983-1984 he taught at another school. He was a close friend of the complainants' family, often visiting their home and regularly staying overnight. When he stayed he slept in the boys' bedroom. He moved into the home permanently for a period of two years. This occurred in late 1984 (according to the appellant) and, with some hesitation, according to the complainants’ mother). 
      
       
     5 The indecent assault charges for which the appellant was convicted involved CD. They concerned incidents said to have happened in the boys’ bedroom or in a small flat occupied by the appellant at his monastery when he was living there prior to the time that he moved in with the family. The charges were to the effect that the appellant instigated improper sexual contact with CD. The Crown case is summarised in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 1  
         
        
        
         
         The appellant regularly drove CD, who then was in year 6 of primary school, to and from basketball, which he played for the senior school, instead of attending primary school sport each Thursday. CD’s mother (T8.11.00 5) and father (T8.11.00 28) gave evidence that CD played for the senior school and the appellant did on occasion take CD to basketball and bring him home. CD’s father said that in the early 1980s, the appellant drove the appellant’s father’s car, had access to a college vehicle, and borrowed his own car at times (T8.11.00 32). 
         
        
        
         
         On one such occasion, the appellant drove CD home, stayed, and had a meal (T6.11.00 8). CD shared a room with his two older brothers which contained two double bunks with a spare bunk below. RD and the eldest brother were present. CD gave evidence (T6.11.00 9) that the appellant massaged his back and backside, rubbed CD’s penis, then climbed onto the bed fully clothed and pulled his and CD’s pants down. Afterwards, CD had a shower and cleaned his teeth because he felt “all dirty” (T6.11.00 13). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 2 
         
        
        
         
         On his 13th birthday 15 March 1983 (T7.11.00 1) his parents took CD, who had been injured falling from a tree three weeks previously, home from hospital after he had stitches removed. Later that night, the appellant visited him in his bedroom after CD had gone to bed. The light was off and RD was in the room. CD said (T6.11.00 15) that the appellant began massaging his neck, worked his way down his back, grabbed his hands and put them on the appellant’s penis whilst touching CD’s penis. CD ejaculated. CD also gave evidence that the appellant rubbed his hands over CD and put his penis between CD’s “backside” (T6.11.00 15). The appellant then went to RD’s bed on the top bunk (T6.11.00 6). 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant’s mother said (T8.11.00 9) that the appellant visited CD in his bedroom during this period. 
         
        
        
         
          
         Count 3 
          
         Some 2 months after his accident in February 1983, the appellant stayed in the Marist Monastery at Ambarvale while recuperating from a broken leg. CD gave evidence (T7.11.00 5) of staying overnight in the small flat occupied by the appellant on more than one occasion, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Sexual activity occurred during his visits. 
         
        
        
         
         CD particularized the first of these occasions (T7.11.00 6-9). His mother had driven him there (T7.11.00 56). The appellant drank beer to excess, and CD went to sleep on the floor. He was awoken by the appellant pulling him into his bed. The appellant forced to rub his penis while he rubbed CD’s. CD then ejaculated. About one hour later, the appellant repeated this activity until CD ejaculated again. CD said he remained on the appellant’s bed because he was scared at the time, but eventually got onto the mattress and went to sleep (T7.11.00 10). The appellant remembered his mother picking him up the next day, and riding bikes with RD (T7.11.00). 
         
        
        
         
         The complainants’ mother (T8.11.00 12-13) and father (8.11.00 31) gave evidence of CD staying overnight with the appellant at Ambarvale. His parents drove him there and picked him up (T8.11.00 12-13). 
         
        
        
         
         Count 4 
          
         After leaving the monastery, the appellant came to reside at the complainants’ house some time in the period following his car accident. CD gave evidence (T7.11.00 12-14) of the appellant repeating his former conduct with him, that is massaging him and forcing him to engage in mutual masturbation. But on this occasion, after CD had ejaculated, the appellant tried to penetrate CD’s anus but was unsuccessful because of CD’s resistance (T7.11.00 15). 
         
        
       
     6 The events relevant to counts 5, 7 and 9 (sexual intercourse with CD without consent) were said to have occurred shortly after the events of count four, ie soon after the appellant had left the monastery and come to reside at the complainants' home. The Crown summarised its case relevant to these counts in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         Count 5 
         
        
        
         
         CD said that a “couple of nights later” (T7.11.00 15), the appellant, after climbing onto RD’s bed, then leaving it and entering CD’s bed; pushed his penis into CD’s mouth and “made rocking type movements until he ejaculated” (T7.11.00 16-18). CD felt sick afterwards, had a wash and washed his mouth. He also said he felt “[a] bit scared” of this conduct. 
         
        
        
         
       Count 7 
        
        
         
         A couple of nights later, the appellant again came to CD’s bed. He said (T7.11.00 19) the appellant tried again, unsuccessfully, to put his penis into CD’s anus. He forced CD to engage in mutual masturbation, then slid down the bed and forced him to suck the appellant’s penis. CD said (T7.11.00 19) “I wasn’t really participating in it, he would force it in … I’d have to open my mouth to breathe and that’s when he forced it in”. After he ejaculated on CD’s stomach, he got out and climbed to RD’s bed. CD had a shower. 
         
        
        
         
         Count 9 
         
        
        
         
         CD gave evidence (T7.11.00 20) of a similar instance of forced oral sex occurring a few nights after this. 
         
        
       
     7 Counts 11 and 13 (sexual intercourse without consent) involve the second complainant RD. The Crown has provided the following summary: 
      
       
        
         
         Counts 11 and 13 
         
        
        
         
         The first recollection RD had (T7.11.00 86-88) of sexual assaults by the appellant occurred in 1983, after the appellant had moved into the complainant’s home following his motor vehicle accident. The appellant had been drinking. He woke RD up as he was going to bed and kissed him, forcing RD’s mouth open with his tongue (T7.11.00 90) then fondled RD’s penis. He put RD’s penis in his (the appellant’s) mouth. RD particularly remembered this occasion because of the toothpaste taste and the appellant’s unshaven facial hair. 
         
        
        
         
         RD turned 16 on 29 November 1983. He said the event occurred before he turned 16, because he went to Blacktown G-Cart racing Track on his birthday, and the assault had occurred before that. 
         
        
        
         
         On another occasion, (T7.11.00 89-90) RD’s mother came into the boys’ room. RD was on the lower bunk, where the appellant slept. He was lying in the bed while the appellant knelt on the floor, sucking his penis. The appellant jumped into the bed and RD crouched down at the end of the bed. RD did this because he was scared and embarrassed (T7.11.00 90). RD’s mother asked the appellant what he was doing, and he said he was just getting into bed (T7.11.00 91). The appellant had been drinking (T7.11.00 93). 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant’s mother gave evidence that she entered the boys’ room one night (T8.11.00 15) when she heard RD, who was in bed, tell the appellant “to go to hell”. She stood at the door and saw the appellant beside the bed. The complainant’s mother was concerned about the relationship between the appellant and CD and RD on this occasion. She said (T8.11.00 15) that she asked RD if he had any worries about the appellant sleeping in the room and that RD had said “no, he’s just silly when he comes to bed and wants to wake us up”. 
         
        
       
     8 Both complainants gave evidence that the appellant had engaged in conduct of a similar nature to the specific acts alleged in the indictment over a lengthy period of time. 
      
       
     9 RD reported the complaint to police in 1997 and CD in early 1998. Each brother said in evidence that he had been too scared to speak to the appellant about his behaviour, despite continuing contact with him. 
      
       
     10 When told by police that there were a number of child sexual abuse allegations against him by the complainants, the appellant said: ""there are some things"". This was in May 1998. The appellant participated in two interviews with the police and videotapes of them were tendered. He denied the various incidents said to have occurred in the early 1980s and which were the basis of the charges in the indictment. However, he admitted that there were other, later occasions on which, he said, the complainants initiated sexual contact, but he said that this occurred when the complainant was 15 or 16. He denied the accusations that became the subject matter of the counts in the indictment. 
      
       
     11 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He first met the family in January 1979. He agreed that there was regular contact thereafter but he offered specific denials relevant to whether the jury should accept the evidence of the complainants concerning unlawful events said to have occurred between January 1980 and December 1983.  
      
       
     12 The appellant denied the accusations charged and he gave some positive evidence tending to cast doubt upon the chronology of events according to the complainants. Under cross-examination he admitted kissing RD on the lips and putting his tongue in RD's mouth. He admitted in the record of interview and under cross-examination that RD was not ""legally"" old enough to initiate or consent to the sexual acts. He agreed that he gave no thought to the legal consequences of his own acts. He admitted to massaging CD near the groin area when he could have been in primary school and that CD got an erection as a result. In relation to count 3, the appellant told police in his record of interview that he and CD lay together on the bed that night before going to bed. He denied any other allegations of sexual assault that were put to him. 
      
       
     13 The appellant denied that he drove CD to and from basketball at the time when CD alleged it occurred (cf count 1), and he offered specific evidence to support this. First, school policy prevented primary boys playing in senior teams. Second, the appellant did not own a car in 1980 although in the middle of 1980 he had access to his parent’s car. Third, a photograph of the under 14 basketball team in the 1980 school magazine did not depict CD, but did depict RD. Fourth, the appellant attended university lectures after school on Thursdays and they ran from 8 to 9pm. He tendered an essay submitted on 10 April 1980 (a Thursday). 
      
       
     14 The appellant said that he did not visit CD in his home following CD’s fall in 1982. He denied the allegation that he masturbated CD. 
      
       
     15 The appellant said that it was not until October or November 1984 that he moved into the complainants’ family home. He tendered some evidence capable of supporting this assertion. 
      
       
     16 The appellant said that the incidents between him and the boys of which he made admissions in the record of interview occurred later, after he began living permanently at the family home. These events were not covered in the indictment. The appellant admitted to acting dishonourably and unlawfully, but he pointed to the complainants’ slightly older years and to their own alleged conduct as showing his misconduct in a less heinous light. He denied forcing sexual contact at any time. 
      
       
     17 The appellant was of course only on trial for the charges proferred in the indictment. It was for the Crown to prove that the appellant should not be believed as to his dating of those incidents which he admitted had occurred, or alternatively to advance some proper basis for the admitted misconduct to be used by the jury as evidence tending to prove the offences charged. The jury were told that the admitted conduct could be used as evidence of the relationship between the parties, but for no other purpose and they were reminded that, on the accused’s version, the boys were over 16 at the time and had been instigators in the conduct in question. 
      
       
     18 In the upshot it is unnecessary to examine the appellant's challenges concerning the trial judge's refusal to sever the indictment and his failure to give stronger directions as to the very limited way in which the evidence of one complainant could be used in relation to the charges involving the other complainant. 
      
       
     19 There must be a new trial because of the directions relating to delay in complaint. The relevant directions were: 
      
       
        
         
         Evidence has been given in this trial of events that are alleged to have occurred in about 1979 onwards to 1983’84 – some 17 years ago when the complainants were in late primary school and early high school according to the complainants and some years later according to the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Time has made it difficult for witnesses to completely recall circumstances and details – and you have got evidence just by listening to the various witnesses that have given evidence in this trial as to the way they say “Oh I can’t remember that” or “It might have been round this date” or “I just can’t remember that particular thing, can’t bring it to mind” – as can be seen, as I say from nearly all the witnesses called on behalf of the Crown and the accused as well. And as well as perhaps leave scope for the dishonest, if there be any, witnesses. No complaint was made as I say until about 1997 or ’98. 
         
        
        
         
         Investigation has been made difficult by this delay, not only for the Crown but also for the accused. It is not easy to find records and witnesses after that period of time has elapsed. These matters lead to a situation in which the evidence may be unreliable for a number of reasons; one, the age of the boys at the time; the period of time that has elapsed, and as I say the interference occasioned to both sides to fully investigate. I said “may be unreliable” not must be. You should carefully consider the factors that I have mentioned when assessing the evidence and the witnesses and the weight to be given to the evidence of the various witnesses. 
         
        
        
       
     20 Over the last decade the High Court has emphasized the need for trial judges to warn a jury that it is unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant who gives evidence of a sexual offence long ago when the complainant was a young person. In stating the matter in this way I am not attempting to give a precise summary of the body of case law. The milestones are Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427, The Queen v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362, Crampton v The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133 and Doggett v The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1290. A scholarly analysis may be found in the very recent judgment of Heydon JA (Wood CJ at CL and Carruthers AJ agreeing) in R v GPP [2001] NSWCCA 493. Heydon JA said (at [49]): 
      
       
        
         
         It follows from the majority opinions in  
         Doggett v R 
          that delay coupled with forensic disadvantage is sufficient to create an obligation to give a  
         Longman 
          warning, and it follows from the majority opinions in  
         Crampton v R 
          together with that of Kirby J in  
         Doggett v R 
          that delay capable of creating the phenomena described by Deane and McHugh JJ in  
         Longman v R 
          is also sufficient. 
         
        
        
       The phenomena described by Deane and McHugh JJ in  
       Longman 
        include problems stemming from the impact of imagination, emotion, prejudice and suggestion on the capacity to “remember”, especially as regards the events of childhood. 
        
       
     21 The circumstances of the present case demanded a Longman warning. The need for it was heightened by the rather unusual circumstances of this case, involving as they do an appellant who had admitted inappropriate and unlawful conduct (albeit not to the degree charged in the indictment) but who insisted that it was (in part) of a different nature to that charged and that it occurred at a different period in the family history when the complainants were older. 
      
       
     22 In light of the case law, the circumstances of this case required a warning as distinct from the comment embodied in the passage set out above. There is a further difficulty with that passage in that it suggests that the Crown case was also entitled to be viewed sympathetically having regard to the problems of delay. The purpose and form of a Longman warning are directed at protecting the accused from being convicted otherwise than in circumstances of heightened jury scrutiny and caution. 
      
       
     23 The Crown points out that the appellant was able to gather specific evidence tending to support his denials in relation to CD and his assertion that it was not until October or November 1984 that he moved into the complainant’s family home on a permanent basis. The latter point assumed considerable materiality because of CD’s evidence that the more serious counts of sexual intercourse without consent (counts 5, 7 and 9) occurred soon after the appellant came to reside at the home in the period following his car accident. Those counts were charged as having occurred between 1 February 1983 and 31 December 1983. 
      
       
     24 It is well established that one reason calling for a Longman warning is the forensic difficulty encountered by an accused person in a case such as the present, effectively oath against oath, in garnering information and evidence capable of challenging the complainant’s account of events long ago. An aspect of this forensic difficulty is the inability to recall information vital to that challenge: unless it can be recalled it certainly cannot be garnered, tested and (if appropriate) proved in the case of the accused person. 
      
       
     25 The Crown invoked the proviso, relying particularly upon the appellant’s admissions in his records of interview. This was, and apparently still is, a strong Crown case, but it cannot be said that a conviction was inevitable. Furthermore, the direction was fundamentally flawed and it is impossible to conclude that no miscarriage eventuated. 
      
       
     26 It becomes unnecessary to consider the remaining issues and it would in my view be unproductive to express any view upon them. It is difficult to conceive that, in any future trial, the defence would leave it to the end of the Crown case before pressing an application to sever the indictment. Whether or not that was a correct reading of this Court’s interlocutory decision in R v Folli [2000] NSWCCA 460 need not be addressed. At any further trial the defence will have the totality of the evidence given in the earlier trial upon which to press any claim to sever the indictment. Failure to do so at the outset would probably lead to the inference that the defence saw tactical advantage in a single trial involving the two complainants. 
      
       
     27 If a future trial proceeds on a similar indictment then one would anticipate that both Crown and defence counsel will give the trial judge full assistance as to proper directions concerning the limited use of the evidence of one complainant touching independent acts of misconduct in relation to counts involving the other complainant. 
      
       
     28 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
       
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       2. Conviction and sentence set aside. 
        
       3. New trial ordered.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant in respect of two offences of breaking, entering and stealing charged on indictment. It was also requested that a further six offences be taken into account on a Form 1 document. They were so taken into account. The sentence ultimately imposed upon the applicant comprised a head sentence of five years and three months imprisonment to commence on 18 January 2001 and expire on 18 April 2006, with a non-parole period of two years and three months to expire on 18 April 2003. 
      
       
     2 The several offences which brought the applicant before the Court were comprised firstly in the two counts to which I have referred. Count one was a charge of break, enter and steal, an offence under s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Count two charged an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, punishable under s.112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The other offences taken into account on the Form 1 comprised take and use a conveyance; break, enter and steal; possess housebreaking implements; another offence of possess housebreaking implements; an offence of possess explosive device and an offence of possess prohibited drug. 
      
       
     3 The learned District Court judge, when dealing with those matters, set out those offences and the short factual statements concerning them in chronological order in his remarks on sentence. It is not necessary, in the manner in which this application has been conducted, to recite those offences in detail. 
      
       
     4 The offences commenced on 9 July 1997 and included two offences committed that day, an offence subsequently committed in that month and offences committed in April 1998. It is apparent there had been a considerable delay in the ultimate disposition of the case. 
      
       
     5 The applicant was born on 22 April 1966 and was aged 34 years and nine months at the time of coming forward for sentence. The learned trial judge held that he was a man approaching middle age who knew that he ought not to have been involved in the criminal offences that he had committed. Reference was made by his Honour to extensive material going to the applicant's personal circumstances and, in particular, to material indicating to the trial judge that the applicant had reached the cross-roads of his life, had, to a great extent, moved towards rehabilitation and was a person for whom the prospect of rehabilitation was attended by a considerable air of reality.  
      
       
     6 In the remarks on sentence his Honour looked at individual considerations and, in particular, such matters as the applicant's medical position, marital status, alcohol and drug abuse, character and so forth. It is not contended that there was any error in his Honour approaching the matter in that way or approaching the matter by having regard to the principles to which this court referred in Re Attorney General's Application [No 1] under s.26 Criminal Procedure Act; Regina v. Ponfield (2000) 7(1) CrimLN2. 
      
       
     7 What is contended is that the course the trial judge in due course took was such as to expose an unexpressed error of principle in his conclusion. 
      
       
     8 His Honour had afforded a 25% discount for plea, had concluded contrition was genuine and in the context of the applicant's marital situation said:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""It seems clear he has, as it were, turned his life around. Rehabilitation of an offender is an important consideration, however, it is not an overwhelming consideration."" 
         
        
       
     9 That remark was made by his Honour in the context of his finding of the positive effect upon the applicant of his marital relationship, his weaning from drug abuse, his severing of his former connections and his undertaking of employment, he is seen to be a good father figure to the two children. 
      
       
     10 His Honour reiterated his finding as to the applicant having turned his life around in the context of finding that specific deterrence in this case may not be as important as it might be in another case, but his Honour properly had regard still to general deterrence. His Honour had subsequently in his judgment concluded that, notwithstanding this finding of a positive prospect for rehabilitation, this was not such an exceptional case as would warrant the imposition of a penalty other than full-time custody. That conclusion has not been challenged directly on this appeal. The learned trial judge, however, when it came to the question of ascertaining the appropriate non-parole period, found special circumstances in that the applicant had rehabilitated himself to a marked extent and his Honour continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""... and that is positive and he may well be, although one can never be sure, at the cross-roads of his life."" 
         
        
       
     11 His Honour concluded that the appropriate sentence was as I have set out and that the non-parole period should be varied from the statutory formula to provide for a non-parole period of two years and three months and there should be an order that on release the offender should be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 
      
       
     12 It has been argued on behalf of the applicant that this disproportion of non-parole period in circumstances where the applicant had apparently to a great extent already rehabilitated himself, was such as to show that his Honour had fallen into error and, if there were such an error detected, it is argued that the court should re-sentence entirely. 
      
       
     13 Applying the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that would mean that if there were error detected it would be for this court to pass such other sentence as is warranted in law and should have been passed. However, I am of the view that I can find no such error in the trial judge's determination as would permit intervention. I do not consider his Honour to have erred in holding this is not such an exceptional case that, having regard in particular to the necessity that the sentence should reflect not only the offences charged on the indictment with those in the Form 1, this court should interfere to the extent of imposing a non-custodial sentence.  
      
       
     14 Notwithstanding, however, the Crown submissions, I do conclude that there has to be found in the disproportion the symptom of error on the trial judge's part. I consider it is not open to me, having regard to the trial judge's findings, to be able to conclude that the head sentence expresses those findings as to rehabilitation which the trial judge made and to which he made reference when referring to the non-parole period. Although the trial judge, as the Crown submitted, made reference to that rehabilitation in the context of applying other principles when determining the head sentence, it does not seem to me that the result, having regard in particular to the discount expressly applied by the trial judge, affords recognition to the remarkable degree of rehabilitation which the applicant had manifested. In my view the head sentence can be seen to be an error and should be quashed. I do not consider, however, that the non-parole period is one that is inappropriate, having regard to the degree of rehabilitation and having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences. 
      
       
     15 I conclude that leave to appeal should be allowed, the appeal upheld, the head sentence quashed and a sentence of four years and three months imprisonment be imposed, to commence on 19 January 2001 and to expire on 18 April 2005 with a non-parole period of two years and three months, to expire on 18 April 2003. 
      
       
     16 WHEALY, J: I agree. 
      
       
     17 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

      REGINA v. IAN PATRICK COSIER 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court of New South Wales for various offences, four charged on indictment and some eight offences, included in a Form 1 and taken into consideration by the trial judge. 
      
       
     2 The offences charged on the indictment included conspiracy to commit robbery when armed with a dangerous weapon, a common law misdemeanour. The substantive offence of armed robbery, the object of the conspiracy, is an offence punishable by imprisonment for 25 years. There were, in addition, two counts for offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. Those are offences under s.97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and are punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 
      
       
     3 In addition to those three counts, there was a fourth count of harbour escapee, an offence punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment. The offences on the Form 1 were six offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, and two of larceny of a motor vehicle. 
      
       
     4 The learned trial judge imposed sentences on counts one and two for a fixed term of six years, commencing on 23 April 2001, with a non-parole period of three years and six months, expiring on 22 October 2004. On count three, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, his Honour imposed a sentence of seven years and six months, commencing on 23 April 2003, and expiring on 22 October 2010, with a non-parole period of four years and six months, expiring on 22 October 2007. On count four, his Honour passed a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of seventeen months, commencing on 29 May 2000 and expiring on 28 October 2001. 
      
       
     5 This complex of sentencing produced an overall sentence, as expressed in the Crown's written submissions, of an effective total term of 10 years and five months, with a period of some seven years and five months actually to be served. 
      
       
     6 In an extensive and detailed review of all relevant considerations, the trial judge set out the facts of each of the offences charged on the indictment, and those taken into account on the Form 1. 
      
       
     7 Referring here in short compass to the trial judge's observations, his Honour referred to the conspiracy as being a plan devised between the applicant and a number of co-offenders to abduct the manager of the Katoomba Sky Way at gunpoint from his residence, to force that manager, on attending that complex, to give access to the Sky Way's business safe and detaining the manager's family at gunpoint until the robbery had been completed. The scheme was frustrated when the actions of the family dog caused two co-offenders, who had secreted themselves in bushland next to Mr. Hammond's residence, with a shortened shotgun, to conclude that they might be detected. 
      
       
     8 The other offences included the robbery of the Stone Cottage Restaurant Conference Centre at Leura, where the applicant attended, armed with a shortened lever action .22 calibre rifle, whilst disguised. That offence involved the menacing of staff with firearms. The staff members were not only menaced and detained but were bound with tape by the applicant. A motor vehicle was demanded from the staff and a male staff member coerced into providing the keys. There were also later attempts to access a number of the staff members' bank accounts via ATM machines, utilising what had been taken from the staff members during the robbery. These robberies each had been carefully planned. There had been reconnaissance done by the applicant of the premises. 
      
       
     9 The Blackheath Golf Club was also robbed. The applicant and the co-offender had attended on the evening of Anzac Day, the applicant possessing a Winchester shortened lever action .22 calibre rifle, the co-offender being armed with a shortened pump action shotgun. The rifle had a mag light torch attached to the front sights. The offenders were disguised. Staff again were threatened with the weapons and ordered to lie on the floor. The co-offender struck one of the members of the staff, causing that member of staff to bleed heavily. The co-offender rounded up the patrons then present, some being elderly persons. 
      
       
     10 The applicant forced the bar manager at gunpoint to open the safe. It was the applicant who left the club to retrieve the bar manager's vehicle, whilst the co-offender remained guarding the patrons. It was the applicant who transported the co-offender, the arms and the proceeds to the applicant's premises and later to bushland at Leura. It was at the applicant's premises where the proceeds were distributed. 
      
       
     11 Within days of the commission of that robbery, the applicant and the co-offender attended at the bushland spot in Glenbrook National Park, where the weapons, clothing and ammunition associated with the robberies were buried. 
      
       
     12 The co-offender, Alan Cohen, had escaped from the Kirkconnell Correction Camp at Yetholme, where he had been serving a sentence for armed robbery. He had made his way to the applicant's premises and sought refuge. He was related to the applicant's wife. He was permitted to remain, and up until the applicant's arrest at Manly on 28 April 2000, the applicant and his wife had harboured him by providing both food and shelter for him. The applicant also took the co-offender in his truck on various work-related activities. Those matters constituted the offence charged in the fourth count in the indictment. 
      
       
     13 In respect of the robberies on the Form 1, there were a number of other co-offenders. His Honour referred to those co-offenders and the necessity, in the particular circumstances involved for each of those persons to be sentenced separately. 
      
       
     14 It has been submitted that the additional robbery offences referred to in the Form 1 should be considered as sufficiently related to those robberies charged in the indictment, they being charges which turned upon the identity of individual victims, that additional culpability as is reflected in them should not have been the case in any materially greater increase in the sentence as would have been reflected had they been entirely separate and disparate robberies. I will return to that submission later. 
      
       
     15 The trial judge gave particular attention, when considering those facts to which I have referred, to the account given by the applicant in his interview with police. In that account it is fair to say the applicant offered substantial information to the authorities concerning his own guilt and that of others. He set out in some detail precisely what his own involvement was. He contended, in relation to the conspiracy to rob the manager of the Sky Way that at the time of the commission of that offence the weapons were not loaded. 
      
       
     16 In his account to the police concerning the robbery of the Stone Cottage Restaurant, he confessed that he had suggested the idea to the co-offender. He contended that the use of the weapon by him on that occasion was by means of pointing it, most of the time at least, at the ground. 
      
       
     17 In relation to the robbery of the Golf Club, he made full admissions in his interview as to his part in the offence, and again contended that his weapon was not loaded. He contended that he regretted having been involved in the criminality and that he had been involved as ""led by persuasion"". He said, ""I mean, armed robbery isn't something that I'd give a lot of thought to normally"". He contended that it was the persuasion of his co-offender which had caused him to go ahead and do it, but accepted that he had not been threatened, nor had anyone close to him been threatened, with physical harm to induce him to participate. 
      
       
     18 Although the applicant contended that at this robbery the rifle was not loaded, police had recovered a bag left by the applicant and the co-offender by mistake at the Golf Club, which contained a pair of King Gee overalls, a portion of camouflage cloth and a quantity of .22 calibre ammunition. Such finding does not suggest that the weapon was loaded, but it does suggest that the offenders had brought with them ammunition capable of being used. 
      
       
     19 In relation to the offence of harbour escapee, the applicant made full and frank admissions of the involvement with his co-offender. 
      
       
     20 It is apparent that this was a spate of very grave criminality but it is apparent also that the applicant was, the trial judge having accepted the matters I have referred to that the applicant had disclosed both as to himself and others, entitled in the sentencing complex to substantial consideration for his contrition, his co-operation and his revealing of matters that might not otherwise been able to have been effectively detected by the police. 
      
       
     21 The trial judge gave credit for all of those matters, he said in his remarks on sentence, and to a substantial extent. In his reasons he referred to the necessity to pass a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness of these grave crimes and the proportionality of the sentence. He made reference to Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He made reference to a number of matters, including those of the applicant's prior record, for the purpose of ascertaining what leniency might be extended to him. 
      
       
     22 He concluded, when reviewing a number of factors which he set out in his remarks on sentence, that the criminality was grave, that the applicant's role in the criminality was at a high level, though perhaps not so high as that of the co-offender, and that the persons who had been the subject of the robberies were persons who had been peculiarly vulnerable to the serious threats imposed by the use towards them of weapons of the kind used. 
      
       
     23 His Honour concluded, in relation to the pleas and the disclosures as I have said, that a substantial allowance should be made on sentence to the applicant's advantage for what he had done. He also had regard to what the applicant might do in the future and specifically the danger that might expose the applicant to and the danger that it might expose his family to. His Honour referred to the principle in Regina v. Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. He referred to Regina v. Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 and the Crown's concession that the principles therein set out should be applied to the applicant's sentences for all offences for which he was there to be dealt with. The utilitarian discount for early plea was also applied. 
      
       
     24 His Honour had careful regard to what had been said in the psychologist's report of Ms. Elizabeth Kusch and in that regard, however, tempered what had been said concerning the applicant not knowing Cohen well, by having regard to the admissions the applicant had made that nonetheless he knew Cohen was an escapee. 
      
       
     25 His Honour examined a number of factors that were said to be aggravating factors and concluded that, having regard to the personal factors, which his Honour set out, in particular extracted from what was contained in the psychologist's report, particularly the appalling circumstances under which the applicant grew up, that the applicant was a person of whom there were prospects found in his subjective material of potential rehabilitation. 
      
       
     26 His Honour particularly adverted to Regina v. Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594 at 597-598, concerning the importance of personal rehabilitation, but in the context of the necessity to observe the requirement for public deterrence. His Honour adverted to various other decisions in which that principle has been espoused. 
      
       
     27 His Honour concluded that a substantial full time custodial sentence was appropriate for each offence in all the circumstances and sought to structure his sentence to accord with the principles laid down by the High Court in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. His Honour had proposed on count three, taking into account the eight matters on the Form 1 schedule, to impose a sentence of 15 years imprisonment; but, taking into account the various matters of discount, passed the sentence to which I have already referred, giving in effect, a sentence of just on 50% of that which his Honour would otherwise have imposed. 
      
       
     28 His Honour found special circumstances, which he set out in detail in his judgment. His Honour concluded that the non-parole period to which I have referred should be imposed and ordered that on release the applicant be released to supervised parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. He nominated conditions which were to be included in a parole order. 
      
       
     29 On appeal, it is not contended that his Honour fell into any express error. It is contended that both the sentence and the non-parole period were manifestly excessive. It was contended that his Honour must have commenced at a starting point for his calculation of sentence that was, when one has regard to the sentence passed, too high. 
      
       
     30 Such a submission, of course, does not pay regard to the task imposed on this court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is necessary for this court to consider, having regard to whether there is a flaw in the discretionary process below, whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
      
       
     31 In Regina v. Pont [2000] NSWCCA 419, I set out the various considerations the court must have in mind on a prisoner's appeal or on a Crown appeal. Sentencing is a discretionary exercise. It is not for this court to re-weigh individual components of a sentence to see how they might fit together in the synthesis of which the final sentence will be the outcome. It is the end point, not the starting point, to which we should have regard. Indeed there are indications recently from the High Court that the process of sentencing by way of adopting a starting point, to which is applied reductions, may on occasion amount to such a staged process as is in error. 
      
       
     32 As I have said, it is to the finished product to which we must have regard. Where that finished product is a sentence which, having regard to the culpability of the various offences, and the circumstances of the offender, is so markedly different from that which it is thought by an appellate bench should have been imposed, then the court may, in accordance with the principles in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 299 intervene, on the basis that that sentence is tainted by some unexpressed error of principle. In such a case the court has power under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to re-sentence. Otherwise it does not have that power. It is not a court of review, but a court of appeal for error. 
      
       
     33 Thus, for a sentence to be such a sentence as the court might set aside absent express error, the sentence must clearly, on its face show (ie., it is manifest) that the sentence so far exceeds that which is appropriate as to be beyond the bounds of the exercise of a permissible discretion. Unless the court is affirmatively persuaded of that, then the ground which is sometimes referred to as ""manifestly excessive"" is not made out. 
      
       
     34 In this regard it has been argued here that we should have regard to three other decisions as illustrating why the sentence in the particular case exceeds in that sense what is appropriate. In particular, our attention has been drawn to Regina v. Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5; Regina v. Jolley [2000] NSWCCA 69 Regina v. Fleming [1999] NSWCCA 142. The submission is not so unsophisticated as to refer to those cases as precisely comparable. The submission is designed to illustrate those aspects of sentencing which might suggest, having regard to the sort of sentences imposed in those cases on other persons in other circumstances, that these sentences could be seen to be such as carrying that badge of inconsistency to which the Chief Justice referred in Lowe v. The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. 
      
       
     35 I am, however, unpersuaded of the error asserted. These are very substantial sentences. But these were exceedingly grave crimes. No doubt the applicant has co-operated, assisted and repented, but nonetheless the purposes and principles of sentencing have been properly taken into account by the learned trial judge, and the sentence is, in my view, not subject to attack as being entirely outside the range of a permissible exercise of discretion. I say that, not only in relation to the head sentence, but also in relation to the non-parole period. 
      
       
     36 It was also submitted that it would be, in the event that the court were minded to find error, appropriate to vary the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. It was also suggested that even if no error of law might be found in what the trial judge had done in selection of the relevant proportion, nonetheless that were the court to make a finding of error in the overall sentences, the appropriate course would be to vary that proportion. But it is not necessary, in the view I have taken, for the principal matter argued on the appeal, to consider that matter further. 
      
       
     37 In my view, the application for leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
      
       
     38 WHEALY, J: I agree. 
      
       
     39 GREG JAMES, J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

The most important Crown witness was Mr Brown, who testified that the appellant had confessed the murder to him. Mr Brown gave this evidence under an indemnity from prosecution. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years. The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. Held by Heydon JA (Dowd & Bell JJ concurring), dismissing the appeal against conviction:(per curiam)1. It was not shown that the trial judge erred by failing to give a warning to the jury about Mr Brown’s evidence in light of Mr Brown’s indemnity from prosecution.  
      
       
     a. It was not erroneous for the trial judge to refrain from lending the imprimatur of his office to counsel’s criticisms of Mr Brown’s evidence. If the judge had done so, it would probably have verged on an impermissible usurpation of the jury’s function. 
      
       
        
         
         The types of directions or warnings to which a judicial imprimatur must be lent are usually those compelled by rules of law and practice, and comments on the specific evidence in the case are not such directions. 
         
        
       
     b. Counsel for the appellant at trial did not ask for such a warning in relation to Mr Brown’s evidence. As a result, leave was required on appeal for the relevant grounds, under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. c. Leave to argue the relevant grounds should be denied since the lack of warning caused no miscarriage of justice or unfairness.d. The trial judge cannot be said to have failed to carry out a duty created by s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 to give an unreliable evidence warning. This is because s 165 does not impose a duty to give a warning unless a party requests one (s 165(2)), and no such request was made. The trial judge did not err by failing to make an unreliable evidence warning of his own motion about Mr Brown’s evidence in light of his indemnity from prosecution. 
      
       
        
         
          
         ii. The playing (during the re-examination of Mr Brown such  
         
         that it could not be tested in cross-examination) of a taped conversation between Mr Brown and the appellant was not unfair and did not increase the need for a direction under s 165.  
         
          
         iii. Mr Brown was not a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been “criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”, as required to bring his evidence within s 165(1)(d). Counsel for the appellant at trial did not suggest that Mr Brown was so criminally concerned when he cross-examined him. Even if an “accessory after the fact” could be deemed an “accomplice” under pre-1995 NSW law, it was not shown that Mr Brown was an “accessory after the fact”. The indemnity did not have sufficient “significance” to the reliability of Mr Brown’s evidence.

        iv. Even if it had been shown that Mr Brown was a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been “criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”, it was not shown that his evidence was of a “kind” that may be unreliable under s 165(1). Mr Brown had nothing to gain from establishing the appellant’s guilt, and his evidence was open to scrutiny by counsel and the trial judge.  
        
         
        
       
     (per Heydon JA & Bell J, Dowd J disagreeing in part)2. The trial judge did not err by permitting evidence to be given that went to the relationship between the deceased and the appellant. a. In this case the admissibility of the “relationship evidence” in question was governed by the Evidence Act 1995. Its reception turned upon three issues: relevance, the application/avoidance of any exclusionary provision, and whether any order should have been made under ss 135-137. 
      
      R v Frawley 
       (1993) 69 A Crim R 208, distinguished.  
       
     b. The evidence was relevant under s 55(1). i. The evidence was relevant because (in the light of other evidence) it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, being whether the car journey ended in the killing of the deceased by the appellant.  
      
       
        
       
     ii. The evidence did not relate to so remote a period of time as to prevent it from being relevant. It related to events happening no more than five weeks before the killing of the deceased. a. To the extent that the relationship evidence was hearsay it was rendered admissible by s 72, which makes the hearsay rule inapplicable to evidence of contemporaneous representations made by a person about his/her feelings or state of mind.  
      
       
     b. Error has not been demonstrated in the trial judge’s decision not to exclude the evidence under s 135. The trial judge’s reasoning made s 137 inapplicable, and his s 136 rulings were appropriate. 
      
       
        
        i. The inability to cross-examine the deceased was not unfairly prejudicial in this particular case. The inability to cross-examine the deceased was the necessary result of changes to the law that now permit evidence of a deceased’s state of mind to be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule.  
         
         
        ii. The evidence was not significantly more prejudicial than other similar evidence about which the appellant did not complain.  
         
         
        iii. The trial judge’s instructions to the jury regarding the relationship evidence were satisfactory and were likely to prevent the use of impermissible reasoning .  
        
       
     Per Dowd J: Some of the evidence was inadmissible by reason of s 137.(per curiam)3. Even if the trial judge had erred in any of the ways complained of on appeal, the appeal should be dismissed under the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which allows an appeal to be dismissed when “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. a. The proviso can be applied when the error is not so fundamental as to have caused the trial to miscarry so far as hardly to be a trial at all, and the conviction was “inevitable”, so that the appellant has not lost a chance of acquittal fairly open to him. 
      
       
        
          
        Glennon v R  
        (1994) 119 ALR 706, applied. 
         
        
       
     b. In this case, the alleged errors were not “fundamental” in the necessary sense. The Crown case was very strong making conviction inevitable. There was evidence suggesting motive, capacity, opportunity and consciousness of guilt on the appellant’s part. There were questionable aspects of the appellant’s testimony. The jury would have accepted Mr Brown’s evidence even if the direction which it is now claimed should have been given was given. There were many items of evidence with force independent of the “relationship evidence”.Held by Heydon JA (Dowd & Bell JJ concurring), dismissing the application for leave to appeal against sentence:1. The trial judge’s sentencing discretion did not miscarry. The appellant’s intellectual and physical difficulties did not amount to “special circumstances” warranting a non-parole period of less than three-quarters of the head sentence under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.a. The appellant’s active working life as the owner and operator of small businesses and enterprises, evidences much more capacity than that which would show mental or physical disability for s 44(2) purposes.  
      
       
     b. The overall sentencing result was not unjust. The head sentence itself was lenient, considering the seriousness of the crime. When the trial judge calculated the head sentence he took into account the difficulties that the appellant’s condition would cause in serving the sentence. For the difficulties to be taken into account again on appeal in relation to the non-parole period would involve doubling up.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
       
       HEYDON JA 
       :  
        
       
     1 On 23 April 2001, after a trial before Barr J and a jury, Steven John Clark, who was born in 1965, was convicted of murdering Lynette Kay Lock on 7 February 1999 at Mathoura. On 14 June 2001 the trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years. This is an appeal against both conviction and sentence.  
      
       
        
       Background 
       
     2 The background to the appeal is sufficiently explained by the facts as found by the trial judge in his remarks on sentence.  
      
       
        
         
         “The offender was invalided out of the Royal Australian Navy because of serious disabilities resulting from injuries he received in a motor vehicle accident that occurred during his naval service. He received a substantial amount of money by way of compensation and used part of it to purchase the franchise of the post office at Mathoura in about 1993. He began to manage and operate the post office. He also purchased dwelling houses in Mathoura and elsewhere. One such house, in the village of Mathoura, was occupied by the offender’s mother, Mrs. Heil. She suffered from multiple sclerosis. 
         
        
        
         
         The deceased, Lynette Kay Lock, also lived in the village. She successfully applied for the franchise to deliver mail from Mathoura to residents of the village and certain of the outlying districts. She and the offender seem at first to have had a reasonable working relationship. Their responsibilities were independent. The offender was not responsible to see that the deceased carried out her duties properly and had no authority over her. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender was always concerned about his mother’s state of health and there came a time when he thought it might be in his mother’s best interests to have someone such as the deceased living with her in the house. He suggested to the deceased that she board with his mother, in effect paying a portion of her rent in money and a portion in caring for Mrs Heil and doing help around the house. 
         
        
        
         
         As time went on the offender’s attitude towards the deceased changed. It is necessary in order to explain that change to say something about his perceptions of her, her conduct and her intentions. It is not generally necessary, however, to consider whether his perceptions were accurate. 
         
        
        
         
         Unfortunately tension arose between Mrs Heil and the deceased. It was suggested to the offender that the deceased was interfering in the friendship of Mrs Heil and other residents of the village and behaving in a domineering and possessive manner. There were other problems too. Complaints were made that the deceased was not delivering the mail satisfactorily. Members of the public did not understand that the offender was not responsible for the manner in which she did her work and brought their complaints to him. That also caused the relations between the offender and the deceased to deteriorate. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender and his family received advice, including medical advice, that it would be better for Mrs Heil if the deceased were to move out of her house. The deceased was given a month to find other accommodation. By that time she no longer had the postal delivery franchise. It appeared to the offender as though she were making no effort to find anywhere else to live. He knew, for example, that there were vacancies at the caravan park, yet she said that she had been unable to find accommodation. I think that the offender must have suspected that the deceased would not move out of Mrs Heil’s house unless substantial pressure were brought to bear. 
         
        
        
         
         On the morning of 7 February 1999 the offender and Mrs Heil were due to leave Mathoura to attend a barbecue at a village in Victoria about sixty-eight kilometres from Mathoura. The journey between the two villages would have taken about forty-five minutes. The barbecue was being held by a sister of the offender and the plan was that he should take Mrs Heil there. The barbecue was due to commence at about 11.30am. Two witnesses remembered seeing the deceased alive on the morning of 7 February. One, Miss Bright, was serving in a shop and attended to her some time between 9 and 10.30am. Mr Colin Robertson, a particular friend of the deceased, said that she left his house at about 9.30am. Witnesses who attended the barbecue estimated the time of arrival of the offender and Mrs Heil as between midday and 1pm. The evidence of the offender was that they arrived at about 11.30am, having stopped off on the way in Echuca to purchase sausages and for him to inspect his investment properties there. 
         
        
        
         
         The pine forest where the remains of the deceased were found several months later was rather more than twenty kilometres out of Mathoura in the opposite direction. The jury were obviously satisfied that the offender had time to collect the deceased from Mrs Heil’s house, take her to the pine forest, kill her and dispose of her body and return to Mathoura in time to collect Mrs Heil and take her to the barbecue. 
         
        
        
         
         DNA evidence satisfactorily identified the few remains found months later as those of the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         The most important witness in the Crown case was Mr Scott Dennis Brown, an old friend of the offender from their Navy days and one of the few who had kept in touch with him since his medical discharge. They saw each other a number of times each year and were in a sideline business together. Mr Brown, who lived in Canberra, used to purchase second hand computers and prepare them for resale. Some of them were sold through the offender at Mathoura. On one of the visits of Mr Brown to Mathoura the offender told him that he had driven the deceased from Mathoura to the pine forest and had shot her three times before dragging her body some way into the forest and leaving it. He left with Mr Brown some written instructions for the use of a 9 mm Browning pistol.  
         
        
        
         
         Mr Brown kept these things to himself for a long time but eventually told the police and when a search was carried out later on three fired cartridge cases were found, appropriate for use with 9 mm bullets. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury were instructed that they must not find the offender guilty unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brown’s account of the manner in which the accused told him he killed the deceased was reliable. I conclude that the offender killed the deceased in the manner which he described to Mr Brown. His intent was to kill. I think that his motive for doing so must have been his frustration over the difficulties he was having in getting her to leave his mother’s house, coupled with his anxiety for his mother’s health and his resentment over troubles he had had because of the deceased’s failure to carry out her delivery duties properly and which were no fault of his.” 
         
        
        
       Grounds 1 and 2: directions about Mr Brown 
        
       The grounds 
       
     3 These grounds are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour failed to direct the jury in relation to the critical evidence of Mr Brown that because of his indemnity from prosecution his evidence was unreliable within the terms of s 165 of the Evidence Act. 
         
        
        
         
         2. That whilst His Honour did direct the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt about Mr Brown’s evidence they would have to acquit the accused, they were not directed as to the caution referred to in s 165(2) and the weight to be given to it.” 
         
        
        
       Mr Winter 
       
     4 The appellant has drawn attention to the fact that Anthony Dean Winter, a truck driver, gave evidence that he had seen the deceased alive on the road near Mathoura at about 12.19pm on 7 February 1999 as his truck drove past her. If that evidence were correct, it excluded the possibility of the appellant having murdered the deceased. Mr Winter had never seen the deceased before; he had identified her from photographs; and his evidence as recorded in the transcript is somewhat vague and uncertain. The trial judge directed the jury that if they thought there was a reasonable possibility that Mr Winter’s identification was accurate, the appellant had to be acquitted. The trial judge then directed the jury at some length about the factors bearing on Mr Winter’s identification and what counsel said about them.  
      
       
     5 The appellant pointed out that the trial judge said at page 21 of his summing up: 
      
       
        
         
         “I want now to come to the evidence of Mr Brown. It and possibly the evidence of Mr Winter is the most important evidence in the trial and I am going to leave the evidence of Mr Winter till last.” 
         
        
       
       
       The appellant submitted that since the jury had evidently rejected Mr Winter’s evidence, Mr Brown’s evidence remained as the most important evidence in the case.  
        
        
       The summing up about Mr Brown 
       
     6 The trial judge said the following about Mr Brown in his summing up, which began on the morning of Friday 20 April 2001. The details are important for various reasons. One of the reasons is that since the addresses of counsel are not in the appeal papers, the trial judge’s summary of the submissions advanced for the appellant is the only guide to what they were.  
      
       
        
         
         “In order to prove the exact manner of Miss Lock’s death the Crown relies on the evidence of Mr Brown. You will remember that when he opened the case to you three weeks ago the Crown Prosecutor told you that the evidence of Mr Brown would be critical to the Crown case and he said the same thing in his closing address to you yesterday. It is only Mr Brown’s evidence that can prove that the accused did the act causing death, namely, the shooting of Miss Lock. It is only Mr Brown’s evidence that can prove that when he did the act causing the death of the deceased the accused intended to kill Lynette Lock or at least to do her really serious injury. As I have told you, the Crown must prove both those matters beyond reasonable doubt and by putting the matter in that way at the start of this trial, that the accused shot the deceased, that is something the Crown has to prove. 
         
        
        
         
         You may be tempted to see the resolution of this trial as depending on which of Mr Brown and the accused is telling the truth. Mr Brown swears that the accused confessed to him that he had shot Miss Lock and the accused swears that he said no such thing. You may during the course of your deliberations decide which of the two is telling the truth. However, if you regard the matter only in that simple way, you may be misled and forget what I have already told you, namely, that it is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt; no burden of proof lies on the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         It follows that before you can find the accused guilty you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Brown is a truthful and accurate witness insofar as he tells you that the accused confessed to him that he shot Miss Lock. I will come back and deal with Mr Brown’s evidence in due course … .” 
         
        
       
     7 Later he said (at pages 21-27): 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Brown had known the accused for years, they had been in the Navy together as young men. They had remained friends after they both left the Navy. I think Mr Brown left somewhat earlier than the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused had to leave the Navy when he was invalided out after that very serious accident he had on the motor bike. But whereas it appears that a lot or most of the accused’s friends lost contact with him, Mr Brown was one of those who remained in touch with him. Mr Brown was in the computer industry in Canberra and he had the sideline of apparently buying up old government computers, re-conditioning them and selling them and he got the accused to sell some of them through the post office at Mathoura. They saw each other regularly; they stayed at each other’s places. 
         
        
        
         
         At some time during the period of two weeks after 7 February 1999, the day on which Miss Lock went missing, Mr Brown and the accused went to the Middle Pub in Mathoura. It was called the Pastoral Hotel and Mr Davis was the licensee. There is no dispute that they were both there. There is a lot of dispute about the circumstances in which they were there. One of the things you are going to have to consider is whether things did happen in precisely the way that Mr Brown says. 
         
        
        
         
         He says that there was first a drink in the bar, in the public bar or a bar anyway. He had no more than one drink there. They then went in for dinner and they had more to drink for dinner. Then they walked home and then they relaxed at the accused’s house and at various stages of that evening the accused said things to Mr Brown. 
         
        
        
         
         About what the accused said to him, Mr Stratton read a portion of Mr Brown’s evidence yesterday and said that it was gobbledygook. I will read a number of passages to you including that one and you remember the evidence of Mr Brown and the manner in which he gave it.  
         
        
        
         
         The Crown made a submission to you that you would extract from what he said eleven different things that the accused told Mr Brown. I will come back to them when I have read some passages of evidence to you. I am going to read part of the transcript which follows on from a description that Mr Brown had given about where they were on that evening, going to the pub, going in to dinner, walking home, at the accused’s house. [Page 315] Line 3: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. On the basis of the conversation you had with the accused that evening, are you able to say what he told you about the physical manner in which Miss Lock met her death. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What did he say to you? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He took Lynette Lock for a drive in the car, drove out to the bush -- 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Did he tell you where that bush was? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He mentioned places and directions but to me they were meaningless. And he asked, he got her out of the car, asked her out of the car, he said she was nervous so he insisted she got out of the car, she got out of the car and that was when he produced the gun, the weapon he had.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Did he tell you what sort of gun that was? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, a 9 mm Browning pistol that he had, he then – he said she looked at him in disbelief and that was when he shot her in the abdominal area and then he said she like started to walk towards him and that’s when he shot her again and then she went down and he said he shot her again.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And did he say anything concerning what occurred after she had fallen to the ground? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He said a couple of things. He said when she was, that she was a tough bitch, like she took a bullet and she is still coming towards him, he also said he didn’t know if she was coming towards him or trying to get to the sanctuary of the car but she was coming towards him and he said that surprised him and, yeah, he made comment that she was one tough bitch. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And after he had shot her on the third occasion, did he say what occurred next? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I recall him telling me that he then dragged the body a long distance from the murder scene, that he was quite surprised that he managed to get the body – getting the body so far away from the murder scene, given his disabilities and then he told me how he like dug a shallow grave, just cleared away the area with his hands and lightly covered the body. I recall that because I was asking some questions about his – yeah -- 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. And over what you told us there were a number of conversations on this evening at various points, when you were speaking with the accused at his home, whereabouts was the conversation occurring? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. We went towards the back of his property, his property goes back a little way and we got a couple of chairs and were in an almost open area at the back of his property with very little around us, we pulled up a chair each and talked there. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. You told us that the accused mentioned the gun that he had used. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Mmm Mmm. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Was there anything said concerning where that gun had come from? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Nobby told me that he acquired the gun on the black market and that the gun had been returned to the black market for safe keeping until everything had settled down and then we would get the gun back. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Was there any conversation on this evening concerning why he had shot Miss Lock?  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. The why was what we had discussed at the dinner table to some degree but the why wasn’t so important so much, it wasn’t something that was discussed at length, this was something that had happened, later on we discussed how there was [or] how he was feeling as a result of it back at his place.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Page 316 line 47: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. Did he tell you how this event had affected him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, yes, he told me it had affected him very much, he was having difficulty sleeping, a difficult time sleeping and he would feel her presence as if she was around and he was finding it very difficult at night and he was a bit scared from that as a result of experiencing that.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Did the accused on that evening seek your advice about any matter? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, he sought my advice on what to do. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What – how did he come to seek your advice about what to do? What did he say to you? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He said to me, I’m not sure exactly what he said to me to ask my advice, he may have just simply asked what he should do, I don’t recall the conversation leading up to me giving the advice. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Did you give him some advice on this evening? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, I did. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What advice did you give him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I told him that to continue on as if, as normal, as if nothing has occurred. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Yes? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Don’t act suspicious about it because if you act suspicious about people would wonder why you were so concerned about it, that was the type of advice I gave him. I gave him advice to help him to not get caught, is the advice I was giving him to do for the crime he had committed.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         The conclusions the Crown asks you to draw from that and the other evidence you know about are as follows: The accused asked Miss Lock out for a drive on the morning of 7 February. On the drive he insisted that she get out of the car. He produced a gun. It was a 9 millimetre Browning pistol. He shot her in the abdomen. She started to come towards him and he shot her a second time. She fell and after she fell he shot her a third time. He dragged the body for some distance. He was surprised or pleased at having been able to do that, given his disability. He dug a grave or cleared the ground, cleared debris from the ground with his hands. He had obtained the gun on the black market. The events had affected his sleeping. He sought Brown’s advice on what he should do and Brown advised him to act normally.  
         
        
        
         
         Let me go back to the two things that the Crown has to prove in order properly to have you return a verdict of guilty. The first is that the accused did the act causing death. If the account that Mr Brown gave is a reliable one, the accused shot Miss Lock three times with bullets from the 9 millimetre Browning pistol and, as a result of that, she died. If he did that, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did that, then he must have done the act causing death.  
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, the Crown must prove that when he did the act causing death the accused intended to kill or intended at least to do really serious injury to Miss Lock. In this second element you can only come to a conclusion about the intention of the accused when he fired the shots, if you find that he fired the shots, by inference. You cannot get inside people’s heads and know what they are thinking. You can, however, infer what they must have intended by what they did. If the accused ordered Miss Lock out of the car and shot her three times, you might think that it is not difficult to infer that he intended at least to do her really serious injury and probably to kill her.  
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton has not made any submissions to you to the effect that, if you do find that this account of Mr Brown is reliable, you cannot be satisfied that the accused had the relevant intent at the time. This is not the ground upon which this case has been fought. I tell you this because I want you to have in mind what I have already told you about the care that you need to take in drawing inferences from proved facts. 
         
        
        
         
         Anyway, as I said to you before, the Crown cannot prove its case unless you accept as reliable the evidence of Mr Brown at least insofar as he told you that the accused confessed to him that he shot the deceased three times. If you have a reasonable doubt about that, then you will have to find the accused not guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         I said to you during the course of the evidence – it was after one of the witnesses had volunteered some expression of opinion about the accused; I won’t repeat it to you because I don’t want to reinforce it in your minds – that suspicion is not a substitute for proof. You will grant me that there is plenty of suspicion in this case, but that is not enough. The Crown has to prove that the accused said these things to Mr Brown on that occasion at the Middle Hotel, at least insofar as Mr Brown says that the accused told him he shot the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, a number of criticisms have been made about Mr Brown and I am going to come and deal with them. It’s twenty past eleven, I think I will take the morning tea adjournment now but just so that you can understand what is happening, I have drawn your attention now to the central piece of evidence in the case and what I am going to do is go over the rest of the evidence, things which may be argued to support the reliability of Mr Brown’s version of events and things which may be put against the argument for the reliability of that version. And I will try to deal with the issues logically and remind you of the arguments of counsel about them.”  
         
        
       
     8 After the morning tea adjournment, and after correcting what he had said about Mr Brown leaving the Navy before the appellant, the trial judge said (at pages 29-44): 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, the next important piece of evidence from Mr Brown relates to a conversation he says took place on the first weekend of 2000. The accused was in his house. Also present were Mr McKlaren and, of course, Mr Brown’s wife, Kim Brown. Neither Mr McKlaren nor Kim Brown claims to have taken any part in or to have been present at the conversation proper, if I can put it that way They were both there, however, when something began to be said. The evidence of Mr Brown and Mr McKlaren was to the effect that the accused said that some remains had been found in the forest and they were thought to be the remains of Lyn Lock. The evidence of Mr McKlaren and of Mrs Brown is that Mr Brown reacted in a shocked way. Remember the way that he described that? Mr Brown told you he was shocked. He told you then that a conversation ensued between him and the accused. The accused gave evidence about this as well. He says I think that some conversation took place but he says that it was Mr Brown who raised the subject by asking whether remains had been found. Well, that is a matter of fact for you to determine. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Brown said that he was suddenly aware that remains had been found. This was a matter of some significance to him because he had been, he says, keeping that secret to himself al this time. He hadn’t told the police. Brown hadn’t told anybody: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… I was aware suddenly that there had been remains found and when I say aware that there had been remains found, then I reacted and wanted to know how long ago. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. In what way did you react when you were given that piece of information? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I was quite scared and panicked.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         He says the accused also told him that wild animals had got to the remains and there wasn’t much left and they couldn’t find her head. 
         
        
        
         
         I need not read to you from the transcript, I don’t think, but the tenor of Mr Brown’s evidence after that was that it became apparent to him that the accused had known for some time that these remains had been found and were thought to be the remains of Miss Lock and yet hadn’t told Mr Brown. Mr Brown said it caused some consternation in his mind. It was the sort of thing he would have expected the accused to tell him given that he had confided this secret in him some eleven months earlier. He said for that reason he was reluctant to go to the police. 
         
        
        
         
         I will come in due course to deal with Mr Stratton’s criticisms of Mr Brown but these matters are relevant to those criticisms. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Brown is attacked as an unreliable witness for a number of reasons. One of the things Mr Stratton asks you to take into account is that Mr Brown never went off to the police and told them about this, even though he knew that he was concealing a serious offence or committing some kind of offence of that kind. There was some criminality in his not informing the authorities about what the accused had told him, however precisely that may be described by law. At least Mr Brown knew that.  
         
        
        
         
         Mr Brown, you remember, said in the first place he wasn’t going to tell anybody because it would simply be his word against the accused’s word. There was no body, there would be a report, nothing would result, and the accused would know Mr Brown had spilled the beans, betrayed his secret. But then in January the following year Mr Brown did know that there was a body, or at least remains, some hard evidence, yet he still did not go to the police and he didn’t go to the police for another two months. He went, I think, on 11 March, the date of that recorded telephone conversation, and that is relevant to this question of Mr Brown’s honesty and straightforwardness in keeping this matter to himself. 
         
        
        
         
         The next body of evidence about Mr Brown concerns the will and what I will call the Browning instructions. It is not the next thing chronologically. I have taken you from the conversation at the pub in February 1999 to the conversation in Canberra in January 2000. We are now going back to the Easter of 1999. 
         
        
        
         
         This is at page 318: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. When did you next see the accused after that conversation?’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And that conversation is the one at the pub in which the accused told Mr Brown he had killed Miss Lock.  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘A. I’m not sure exactly when that was, the next time we saw each other. Steven come to my house around Easter. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. When he came to your house at Easter, did he stay with you or just visited? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I am pretty confident he stayed a night. Whether that was then, I’m not sure. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. When he came to your house did he give you anything? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, he did. He, during that period he gave me two pieces of paper. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. I show you this document which is marked – can you [tell] me what those two pieces of paper were? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. One was a will, his will. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What was the second one? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. The second piece of paper was a cleaning instructions for a 9 mm Browning pistol.’  
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Well, those documents came into evidence, the copy of the accused’s will is Exhibit T and the instructions for the 9 millimetre Browning are Exhibit O. Both of those documents bear the fingerprints of Mr Brown and of the accused. There seems to be no dispute about that. Both fingerprints on both documents. 
         
        
        
         
         Having taken you back to 1999, I will bring you forward now to March 2000. Mr Brown knew that the police were going to call on him. Apparently the reason for that was some report suggesting that he himself had been in Mathoura in a station wagon at the time that the deceased disappeared. It turns out that there was no substance in that report and it is not put forward at this trial as having any credibility but it seems to be the reason why the police wanted to speak to Mr Brown. 
         
        
        
         
         That is a matter of some importance, as was apparent from one of Mr Stratton’s submissions yesterday. At any rate, the accused, who was in contact with Mr Brown, told him the police wanted to talk to him, so Mr Brown knew that the police were on their way. When they did come he gave them an account of what happened. However, there was this telephone call of 17 March. You have a transcript of it, it is Exhibit V. After Mr Brown gave an account to the police, that was, of course, enough for the police to arrest the accused and that is what they showed every intention of doing. Mr Brown apparently asked the police whether he could have this telephone conversation with the accused in order to explain to him why he had acted as he had done, and that is his explanation of the meaning of the conversation, a transcript of which is Exhibit V. An issue arises about the meaning of that telephone conversation, and I will come back to that in dealing with the criticisms of Mr Brown. 
         
        
        
         
         The last piece of evidence directly relating to Mr Brown is this finding of the three fired cartridge cases on the road beside the pine plantation in the Millewa Forest in March. It is relied on very largely by the Crown as supporting the accuracy and reliability of Mr Brown’s evidence because, the Crown submits, it was not until Mr Brown told the police that the accused had told him that he had shot Miss Lock that the police realised that they were looking for a firearm or signs of shooting or cartridge cases or whatever. The condition of the remains of the body of course gave no clue as to how that person had died.  
         
        
        
         
         A very strong attack has been directed by Mr Stratton on the evidence about the searching of the forest. A particularly strong attack was made upon Inspector Dunn who, although he wasn’t apparently the officer in charge of the search, was a senior man who had some responsibility for directing others in what they should do. 
         
        
        
         
         You remember that when Mr Stratton opened his case to you at the beginning of the trial he made reference to the finding of the cartridge cases in March and I think he used the word ‘amazing’ and he says, he submits to you that it’s quite a remarkable thing that these cartridge cases were found in March when they were not found in September. 
         
        
        
         
         When assessing the reliability of the evidence of a witness you should pay close regard to the demeanour of that witness as you observed the evidence being given and you should weigh the evidence of any witness for what you regard as internal consistency or inconsistency but you are not restricted in that way because you can judge the reliability of a witness by reference to all the evidence in the case and that is a direction which has particular relevance to the evidence of Mr Brown.  
         
        
        
         
         The Crown relies on pieces of evidence which it submits are independent of Mr Brown which it submits show that he was telling the truth in his evidence about the accused’s confession. 
         
        
        
         
         There are pieces of evidence independent of Mr Brown that Mr Stratton relies on as sufficient, he submits, to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of Mr Brown’s account. 
         
        
        
         
         But let me deal with the evidence of Mr Brown in relation to the topics that I have so far dealt with. Namely, that the confession – the alleged confession I will call it – of February 1999, the handing over of the will and the Browning document, if that is what happened, the following Easter and the conversation of January 2000 and all the evidence of what Mr Brown did and, just as importantly, what he did not do over the ensuing months. 
         
        
        
         
         It might be appropriate to pick up the subject I last mentioned, that is the evidence of the search, evidence of the search in the forest. Mr Stratton, you remember, was addressing you about this yesterday. He criticised very strongly the evidence of Inspector Dunn and it does seem, to use an expression of opinion on the facts, but it does seem that his evidence is not entirely in kilter, if I can put it that way with the evidence of other witnesses who know something about it, for example Mr Fawns, I think, who was from State Emergency Services – anyway a non-police agency who volunteered because he had the experience of using a metal detector. He was handed the metal detector, he assembled it and directed the search. The search took place over 13 and 14 September. It did not include the road, it was confined to the taped area, photographs of which you see in Ex B and an area some – I have forgotten – hundred metres, couple of hundred metres distant, it was some kind of hollow or depression that was searched. 
         
        
        
         
         He said that some things were found, nothing of interest, bottle tops and bits of wire. He said he searched on one day only, that was the end of it. Inspector Dunn said that he searched on one day and came back the next day and searched [the] whole area again. I do not think that Mr Dunn mentioned anything about the searching of the depression. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton says you cannot rely on his evidence. Mr Stratton also criticised Mr Dunn and said he was filling in a gap when he made a statement later on some time in 2000 in which he said that the road was not searched with the metal detector in September 1999. Mr Stratton says the only reasonable inference is that Mr Dunn had been told by other police officers that it was necessary to establish that that happened.  
         
        
        
         
         You remember, after the accused spoke to the police, Detective Senior Constable Smith was concerned that no search had apparently been carried out for the cartridges and I think he spoke to, it was Detective Smart, yes, spoke to Detective Smart and apparently it was in that way that Detective Smart went back alone in March, swept the road, found the three cartridge cases which you have in evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton’s central submission on this is that the evidence is so suspect that you cannot regard it at all as boosting the evidence of Mr Brown. He says it is unbelievable that so many people searching – and the evidence was quite a lot of people, all available police officers, were called in from Deniliquin, State Emergency people were called in, I think, perhaps forestry people as well, whoever could be brought in was brought in and you had in excess of 21 people searching at any one time. 
         
        
        
         
         The search took place over several days, the road was searched. Mr Stratton submitted to you yesterday one half of the broken dentures was found on one side of the road and the other half on the opposite side of the road. They could hardly not have searched the road as well. Mr Stratton invited you in view of his general unreliability to ignore the evidence of Inspector Dunn and he relied upon the evidence of the first officer to give evidence, in fact Constable Watson, who said that as far as she was concerned the whole of the area on both sides of the road were searched and the submission based on that is that you would most certainly have expected the police to find those fired cartridge cases even though they might not have been looking for fired cartridge cases as such during that search, so long and sustained was the search. 
         
        
        
         
         So the submission is that there’s something very strange about the way those cartridge cases were not found and then were found. The Crown submission is that they were there all the time. The police didn’t know they were dealing with a shooting in September. The fact that the body, the remains gave no clue about the manner of death. You can accept at face value the evidence about the parts that were searched with the metal detector and those parts did not include the road. The scattering, the dispersal of the fired cartridge cases to the positions in which Detective Smart says they were found in the following March is explained by the evidence of the grading of the road which took place in October, that is between the two dates. They seem to be the submissions on the fired cartridge cases. 
         
        
        
         
         I have already touched upon what Mr Brown says was his reason not to report this matter to the authorities. If he is telling the truth he knew about this shooting in February 1999. He gives as a reason for telling nobody about it, the reason that I have already summarised, that if he reported it nothing would result, in his view the accused would not have been arrested, there was no body. It was word against word. The accused would know that he had been betrayed by his friend and there might be trouble for Mr Brown from that quarter.  
         
        
        
         
         Then, of course, the remains were found, although they were found in September and Mr Brown didn’t learn about that until January. He says there still wasn’t enough for him to go to the police or at least he puts it this way, that although there was now a body, he believed that the accused had been holding out on him, knowing something, keeping it from him and he wondered about the accused’s motives and that was sufficient reason for him to continue to keep quiet about it. 
         
        
        
         
         A strong criticism was made about Mr Brown’s veracity in that claim yesterday in Mr Stratton’s submission to you and you will remember that he said that, whatever you think of Mr Brown, you would not think of him as a reluctant witness, he gave his evidence with some relish. I don’t think they were Mr Stratton’s words but that, I think, summarises the submission. He was rather eager to give his evidence. Well, that’s a submission which you should consider, give it the weight that you consider it deserves, as with all counsel’s submissions and Mr Stratton’s submission to you is that it simply does not explain why, if he is telling the truth, Mr Brown did not go much earlier to the police, certainly by the time he knew that remains suspected to be those of Miss Lock had been found and that is January 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown relies upon the evidence of the will as showing acknowledgement by the accused that he had reposed some weighty serious secret in Mr Brown and that was perhaps something done in acknowledgement of that and of what I will call the Browning document as supporting Mr Brown’s evidence that the accused told him that he had the 9 millimetre pistol, that he had got rid of it for the time being but would recover it in due course and would he look after that document for him. 
         
        
        
         
         The response to that is that the accused – and the accused gave evidence about this, that it was not his document, he had not seen it until his legal advisers showed it to him – he could easily have handled the piece of paper in the shed of Mr Brown in Canberra which he frequently visited. In fact whenever he would go there he would go into the shed because that’s where the I T equipment was kept and where the materials relevant to their sideline business were kept. He gave a demonstration in Court – now, it doesn’t really matter what you think of that but it’s pretty obvious really that a person’s fingerprints can be put on a document by a casual handling and the accused says: Well, I remember nothing about this, I could have handled his stationery, he could have used a piece of – Mr Brown could have used a piece of stationery which he knew I had handled or got me to handle it in some other way, it could be easily done and I suppose that that is right, but the question for you is whether that might have happened.  
         
        
        
         
         I think no submissions were made to you yesterday about the will but the accused’s evidence about that was: Well why should I not. He made reference, I think, in his evidence to his former wife. I suppose I am allowed to say this: As a matter of law divorce doesn’t bring a will to an end so, if you do get divorced, you need to think about making another will unless you want your former wife to get the estate and that goes for former husbands as well, so that might sufficiently explain why the accused should have been making a will anyway at that time, having had this acrimonious breakup with his wife. 
         
        
        
         
         Well, the only question that then remains is the choice of beneficiary. The accused says: Well, why shouldn’t I have left it to him? You would not draw any adverse inference from that fact alone. 
         
        
        
         
         To come back again to the topic of Mr Brown’s silence. Mr Stratton submits to you that Mr Brown was not afraid and that is demonstrated by the fact that all the time he was continuing to go back and stay with the accused in Mathoura. You remember the submission yesterday. He could easily have put the accused off and said: ‘Look, I have got to go through Deniliquin.’ That is the kind of submission. Yet Mr Brown and his family on one occasion went back and stayed in the accused’s house. Would Mr Brown do that if he had the kind of fear of the accused that he told you that he had, such a fear that it stopped him from going to the authorities? 
         
        
        
         
         That brings us I think to the telephone conversation which is recorded, Exhibit V is the transcript of it. I need now to take you back to something the accused said about this in dealing with the events of February 1999. He said to you in his evidence in clear terms that he had never told Mr Brown that he had killed Lyn Lock and this question and answer appear at page 498 line 29: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. Have you got any recollection at all of ever saying to Mr Brown at the hotel, ‘I killed Lyn Lock’ or words to that effect? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Never, never said those words but one weekend he, when he was there, there was a hell lot of joking and jovial stuff going on and I was joking around and I wasn’t denying the fact some incident happened, no-one knew what it was so I just joked along with them and then as soon as we got to the front door and as we were leaving and he turned to me and said, ‘Well, is that what happened? Did you do it?’ And I just thought, you know, this is my best mate and he is questioning me like this so I turned around and said Yes because nothing else jumped into me head so I said Yes.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Look at the transcript, Exhibit V, of the telephone conversation of 17 March 2000. The alternative submissions about that are that it contains references to past relations between the accused and Mr Brown, including that version of events which the accused, through Mr Stratton, asks you to accept as reliable. Or whether, as the Crown says, what is really being referred to here is the confidence which the accused unfairly placed in Mr Brown and put him in that difficult position of having to keep quiet about it. They are the alternative submissions.  
         
        
        
         
         Of course, it is the telephone conversation between two men who have spoken on many occasions before so you don’t get a precise spelling out of the meaning of what is said. Shorthand is used the way it is between people who speak to each other regularly and know what they are talking about but it is a question of the meanings you get from the conversation.  
         
        
        
         
         You heard the alternative submissions about the meaning. The Crown Prosecutor says this supports Mr Brown. Mr Stratton’s submission is that you look at the conversation, it doesn’t bear the meaning contended for by the Crown at all, from first to last pretty it is vague, and insofar as it relates to the specifics, it can be relating to the piece of evidence I have just drawn to your attention. 
         
        
        
         
         There are other pieces of evidence that the Crown says support the Crown case generally and make it more likely that Mr Brown is telling you the truth. In particular, the Crown case relies on the evidence of Mr Wellington as supporting what the Crown says in two ways. First, it shows that the accused was in a remote place close to where the body of Miss Lock must have been not long after she was killed. That proximity of time and place and the remoteness of the place and the fact the accused had apparently no reason to be there implies, the Crown says, that the accused knew that the deceased’s body was there. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown uses the evidence in a second way as well because when the accused was asked whether he had been down the Tocumwal Road, he told a lie about it, the Crown says, and I will deal with that topic in due course. Mr Wellington’s evidence is as follows. He and his friend, Mr Goss, had been fishing and he said by reference to the diary page of Mr Goss that went into evidence that it was 12 February 1999, that is the Friday after Miss Lock went missing. He marked the plan of the cemetery, I’m sorry, of the pine forest. I need not show you that. The point is that he and Mr Goss were headed back into Mathoura, they had just put the pine plantation behind them, they were within a kilometre of the pine plantation heading west and this is at page 156, line 36: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… After you got back on to the Tocumwal road did you see a vehicle coming in the opposite direction? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         A little later: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. When you were approaching that vehicle what sort of vehicle were you in? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. A silver station wagon.  
           
          
         
        
         
       There seems to have been some misunderstanding: 
        
         
          
           
            
           Q. Was that the vehicle you were in? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. No, I was in a Mazda brown utility. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. The vehicle that you saw approaching, what sort of vehicle was that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. A silver station wagon. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Did you recognise that vehicle? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Who owned that vehicle as far as you were concerned? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Mr Clark.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Now, Mr Wellington had lived in Mathoura for years and so by that stage had the accused so they knew each other, and Mr Wellington stated that he recognised the accused’s vehicle. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. Were you able to recognise who it was that was driving this vehicle? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Who do you say was driving that vehicle? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Mr Steven Clark. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. That is the person who was the post office manager in Mathoura? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         He said it was about 12 February, in fact as we know it was the 12th. That comes from the evidence of Mr Goss. 
         
        
        
         
         You remember Mr Goss didn’t claim to recognise the driver of the car. That evidence comes only from Mr Wellington.” 
          
           
             
           
          
         
        
       
     9 The trial judge then gave a lengthy warning about identification evidence with special reference to Mr Wellington, about the use of lies, and about other supposed instances of the appellant’s consciousness of guilt.  
      
       
     10 At page 55 of the summing up the Crown referred to warnings necessitated by the Evidence Act 1995, s 165(1)(b) and (2), and there was some debate about this.  
      
       
     11 After lunch, the trial judge said (page 57): 
      
       
        
         
         “Ladies and gentlemen, a few corrections, I told you just before lunch that the accused’s response to Mr Brown’s evidence about the conversation about the remains being found, the conversation that takes place in Canberra on the first weekend of 2000, was that it was Mr Brown who asked whether any remains had been found. I wasn’t strictly correct about that. What the accused says is that Mr Brown asked what was happening. He didn’t make specific reference to any remains but it was that question which prompted the accused’s response that these remains had been found. 
         
        
        
         
         The next thing is that I told you that fingerprints had been found on the will. In fact, the will wasn’t tested for fingerprints. I am sorry, it is not a matter of any consequence I think. The fingerprints are important so far as the Browning instructions are concerned and Mr Brown’s and the accused’s fingerprints were both found on that document but the will wasn’t tested for fingerprints.”  
         
        
       
     12 The trial judge then returned to issues relating to lies and consciousness of guilt and to evidence about the timing of events on 7 February 1999. The trial judge then said (pages 68-72): 
      
       
        
         
         “Let me come now and just summarise the criticisms made about Mr Brown. I have dealt with some of them already and I am just going to deal with these in a summary way. 
         
        
        
         
         In cross-examination of him Mr Stratton suggested to him that his story was getting better as time went along. It was suggested, for example, that never before this trial had Mr Brown told anybody that the accused had told him that he had cut off the deceased’s head, and reference was made to two previous occasions when Mr Brown had given an account of these things.  
         
        
        
         
         The first was in his statement to the police. The second was in his evidence at the committal proceedings. Before I go on I should say something about committal proceedings. You may not be familiar with the way that criminal trials are brought in this State but you should know this. Accused persons who are sent to the Supreme Court for trial are ordinarily first dealt with by a magistrate sitting in the Local Court. The magistrate conducts an administrative enquiry. It is not a legal proceeding at all. It is an administrative enquiry to see whether the evidence justifies sending the accused for trial. If in the opinion of the magistrate the evidence is sufficient to justify a trial then, as we say, the magistrate commits the accused for trial and this is called a committal proceeding. Obviously in this case the magistrate took the view that there was evidence which justified a trial. But that is all the committal proceedings is and all that it was in this case. The magistrate makes no final determination. The magistrate never considers whether the person he is sending off for trial or she is sending off for trial is guilty. So, you see, the magistrate’s decision to commit cannot bear upon your decision in this trial. It is your decision that matters, not the opinion of a magistrate or anybody else. 
         
        
        
         
         At page 372, Mr Brown was being cross-examined on the second day of his evidence: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. One of the things you said yesterday was that the accused told you back in February 1999 that he had cut the deceased’s head off; remember that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I said -- 
            
            
           Q. Remember saying that yesterday? 
            
            
           A. He had, he cut her head off? 
            
            
           Q. That’s what you said yesterday? 
            
            
           A. Yes. 
            
            
           Q. You have never said that before, have you? 
            
            
           A. I have said it in a round about sort of way but I have never said it straight out like that. 
            
            
           Q. What do you mean a round about sort of way? 
            
            
           A. At the time that he told me that was the time I was saying I didn’t want to hear any more, I didn’t want him to tell me any more, I didn’t want to hear any more. 
            
            
           Q. You have not said before the accused told you he had cut the deceased’s head off? 
            
            
           A. I have said before I am quite confident I have said that in the past.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Well, if he had said that in the past, were there any statements to the police or in his evidence before the magistrate, the Crown would have drawn it to your attention and the Crown did not so you can take it that the first time he mentioned that in terms was at this trial. 
         
        
        
         
         The next bit of cross-examination was about his statement about the accused saying that he dug a shallow grave. This is at page 375, line 33: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. Perhaps if I start the question again. You told us yesterday that Mr Clarke told you back in February 1999 he dug a shallow grave for the body, remember that? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. That is the first time you have told anybody that, isn’t it? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Well, they are the words I used. I think he told me what he had done he scraped away the loose covering on the top of the soil or dirt or whatever it was, loose, it was shallow, it’s like, he dug a shallow -- 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. I am suggesting to you when you said that yesterday in evidence that is the first time you have said it? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. It was discussed at the committal hearing. What did I say then? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q I am suggesting you did not say that at the committal hearing? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I would have said something along similar lines if I did not say those two words ‘shallow grave’.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Then there was a feature to which I have already drawn your attention this morning and that was that significant parts of this conversation at the pub in February of 1999 were made over a beer, one beer, before the two went into the dining room or the bistro. It was pointed out to Mr Brown that he said to the police that he was affected by alcohol. 
         
        
        
         
         All these criticisms of Mr Brown are put to you by Mr Stratton and the submission is that, for one reason or another, his evidence is unreliable. It is suggested that he had more to drink than he says, that he had more to drink than the accused. He says that he was careful about the amount he drank because of the effect it might have upon him. 
         
        
        
         
         Attention is drawn to Mr Brown’s smoking marijuana when he got back to the accused’s house and the submission Mr Stratton makes to you is that, bearing all those matters in mind and bearing in mind the way he gave his evidence, you would doubt whether he really was giving an accurate version of whatever it was that the accused said to him that night. 
         
        
        
         
         I said I would come back and deal with that little bit of evidence that Mr Stratton read to you yesterday. It is this: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Q. As best you recall what was that conversation while you were in the dining room? It had been suggested that something significant was said in the dining room? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. We talked about, basically went through quickly how and why and how did he do this, like I was a bit surprised and he went through – we – to be honest the detail about what we talked about at different places, exactly where we talked about this and exactly where we talked about that and later on we had other conversations as well, I don’t know exactly what we talked about all the time specifically here did we talk about that, there specifically did we talk about that, I am aware of the conversations we had and sometimes I remember exactly where.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton’s submission is that it’s an example of the inexactness, if I can put it that way, of Mr Brown’s evidence. It leads you to doubt the accuracy of his evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Mr Stratton said that Mr Brown – he asked you: Has he an ulterior motive? Is he lying or at least exaggerating or is he just confused and it was about that time he read you that passage and he referred then to the alcohol which he submitted you would accept Mr Brown had on that night and the marijuana and he says essentially Mr Brown’s recounting of events is mixed fact and fiction. 
         
        
        
         
         He drew attention to the money dispute, the $2000 owing, and to the fine which it was submitted the accused had to pay because of something Mr Brown had done. Of course there are two sides to that story and you know Mr Brown’s version of that and the final submission about Mr Brown was that he was lying or at least exaggerating or confused. 
         
        
        
         
         If you think there is substance in this, of course, it doesn’t matter which one or more of those. If you have a reasonable doubt that his evidence is accurate and reliable insofar as he says that the accused told him that he shot the deceased, then that raises a reasonable doubt on the whole of the Crown case and you must find the accused not guilty.” 
         
        
       
     13 The trial judge then summed up about Mr Winter.  
      
       
     14 When the Court reconvened on Monday 23 April 2001, after the parties had had a weekend to reflect on any deficiencies in the summing up, the trial judge said (pages 80-81): 
      
       
        
         
         “I should like to remind you of a few of the important things that I said to you on Friday. The first is that it is for the Crown to prove its case, not for the accused to prove anything. The Crown has to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of two things, first that the accused killed Miss Lock, secondly that when he did do so he intended at least to cause her really serious bodily injury, either that or kill her. 
         
        
        
         
         I told you that the only evidence that will permit you to come to that conclusion comes from Mr Brown and that you must accept him as reliable, at least insofar as he says to you that the accused confessed to him that he had shot Miss Lock. So you do not have to accept everything Mr Brown says but you must accept beyond reasonable doubt that particular part of his evidence going to what he says is the accused’s confession to him of the shooting on the night that they were in the middle pub in Mathoura. 
         
        
        
         
         I also told you that the Crown cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused shot Miss Lock unless it also proves beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Winter was mistaken in his opinion that the person beside the car beside the Cobb Highway was Miss Lock. 
         
        
        
         
         I told you and I remind you that when you are assessing the reliability of any witness, and this refers not only to but particularly to Mr Brown and Mr Winter, you are not restricted to a consideration of the evidence of that witness in isolation but you can and you should assess it by reference to all the evidence in the case.” 
         
        
       
       
       The need for leave 
       
     15 Counsel for the appellant at the trial was Mr B Stratton QC. He was called to the Bar over thirty years before the trial. He took silk more than fifteen years before the trial. He was a specialist in criminal litigation and an extremely experienced trial lawyer. A reading of the transcript suggests that Mr Stratton conducted the defence with energy, resource and capacity. He did not, however, ask for the warning which, according to Grounds 1 and 2, should have been given by the trial judge. This was despite the fact that the summing up commenced on Friday 20 April 2001, and that the trial judge asked counsel before the morning tea adjournment and before the luncheon adjournment whether further directions were required. Before the morning tea adjournment Mr Stratton noted the factual error about the appellant’s Navy service, and the trial judge corrected it. Before the luncheon adjournment Mr Stratton raised a factual matter with which the trial judge dealt after lunch.  
      
       
     16 Before the jury returned after lunch, while Mr Stratton was submitting that a strong warning about identification evidence was not called for in relation to Mr Winter because he was not an accused person, counsel for the Crown referred to s 165(1)(b) and (2) of the Evidence Act 1995. At the end of the day the trial judge invited further directions from counsel, and none were sought. Nor were any sought on resumption after the weekend on Monday 23 April 2001.  
      
       
     17 It follows that leave is needed pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in relation to Grounds 1 and 2. The fact that the warning was not requested is not of itself fatal either to the grant of leave or to the allowing of the appeal. It does, however, point strongly to the view that if so experienced a criminal lawyer as Mr Stratton (or indeed counsel for the Crown) did not think it necessary, the summing up was not defective. Indeed, it points to the view that Mr Stratton either had a particular purpose for deliberately choosing not to ask for a warning, or did not perceive any danger which a warning might alleviate. It is not easy to second-guess such a judgment formed in the thick of the fight by an experienced counsel far more sensitive to the particular forensic environment and the likely reactions of the particular jury than an appellate court could ever be.  
      
       
        
       The summing up: one criticism 
       
     18 Apart from the complaints about a s 165(1)(d) warning set out below, the only written criticism which the appellant made of the summing up was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour made reference to the fact that counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant was critical of the evidence of Mr Brown whom he said was an unreliable witness (page 30). Some reliance was placed upon the fact that Mr Brown never went to the police and told them about his involvement and that he knew he was concealing a serious offence. His Honour directed the jury simply that as Mr Brown did not go to the police until 11 March 2000 was relevant to his honesty and straightforwardness. 
         
        
        
        It is submitted that this direction did not go far enough.” 
        
        
         
        
       
     19 In fact, as appears from the material quoted from page 30 of the summing up, the trial judge set out both Mr Stratton’s attack on Mr Brown for his delay in going to the police (as he did in several places), and lent the authority of his own office to the posing of critical questions about Mr Brown’s delay. The submission does not identify how much further the direction should have gone than it did. This particular submission about the summing up is rejected.  
      
       
       
       The summing up: another criticism 
       
     20 In oral argument the appellant further submitted that though the trial judge set out Mr Stratton’s criticisms of Mr Brown’s reliability, he never lent the imprimatur of his office to them. He “never went on to explain in general terms why the evidence might be unreliable. He referred to Mr Stratton referring to the evidence as unreliable”. This submission should be rejected. First, the types of direction or warning to which a judicial imprimatur must be lent are usually directions compelled by the rules of law or practice, and comments on the specific evidence in the case are not directions compelled by rules of law or practice. Secondly, for the judge to have lent the imprimatur of his office to Mr Stratton’s criticisms by personally aligning himself with them would probably have verged on an impermissible usurpation of the jury’s function. In the end counsel for the appellant conceded that the trial judge’s specific reference to Mr Stratton’s points was perhaps “in the circumstances … a legitimate way for the points to be made in the circumstances of this trial.”  
      
       
        
       The appellant’s s 165(1)(d) and (2) submissions 
       
     21 The appellant’s submissions about s 165(1)(d) and (2) were put thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whilst there are therefore a number of examples of His Honour advising the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the confession made by the Appellant to Mr Brown, he referred only to criticism of counsel appearing as to his evidence being unreliable. It is submitted that a warning ought to have been given pursuant to section 165 of the Evidence Act 1995. The evidence of Mr Brown would clearly fall within subsection (1)(d). 
         
        
        
         
         The warning sought is in the terms of subsection (2) and indeed may have gone so far as to tell the jury that it would be dangerous to convict the accused on this evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         It must be remembered the witness gave evidence about receiving an indemnity that he would not be prosecuted. The indemnity was tendered (Exhibit U) and read to the jury (page 323). The alleged confession was of course totally uncorroborated. 
         
        
        
         
         In those circumstances, it is submitted that the jury must have been warned of the danger of convicting upon such evidence in the absence of corroboration but even more so where the witness has been granted an immunity from prosecution and this needs to be clearly explained to a jury (see R v Chai 68 Crim R 305 at 326/327). The judge in his directions to the jury did not bring home to them why such a warning is necessary and why it needs special scrutiny (R v Chai at 327). It is submitted that the reference by the learned trial judge to the effect that counsel representing the Appellant had referred to the evidence as being unreliable is not sufficient (see R v Merrick John Malouf (unreported NSW CCA 1 Nov 1996). 
         
        
        
         
         Furthermore on 11 April 2001, His Honour delivered a separate judgment on the admissibility of a transcript (page 386). His Honour allowed the evidence of the tape recording to be played (page 389) in re-examination. In his reasons for judgment this application was made by the Crown pursuant to section 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act to adduce evidence of a tape recording of a phone call made in March 2000, in which it was said to refer to the conversation at the hotel. That was a possible construction accepted by the trial judge but bearing in mind it was necessary for the defence to suggest to Mr Brown that his evidence was fabricated, if there was to be a defence at all to the case, there was considerable unfairness in this evidence being admitted in re-examination such that it could not be tested by further cross-examination. Under those circumstances, it is submitted that there was even a greater need for a direction under section 165.” 
         
        
       
     22 There is a problem for the appellant which is anterior to that created by r 4. Section 165 provides:  
      
       
        
         
         “(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
         
        
        
         
         (b) identification evidence, 
         
        
        
         
         (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like, 
         
        
        
         
         (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
         
        
        
         
         (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer, 
         
        
        
         
         (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant, 
         
        
        
         
         (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person – evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
         
        
        
         
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
         
        
        
         
         (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
         
        
        
         
         (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.” 
         
        
       
       
       The appellant complains that the trial judge failed to carry out a duty created by s 165. Section 165(1) creates no duty: it merely says that the section “applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”, and sets out non-exhaustive instances of that evidence in paragraphs (a)-(g). Section 165(2) creates a duty, but it is a duty which is only triggered by a request for the direction by a party. There was no request. Hence s 165(3)-(4) do not apply. Section 165(5) preserves any other power of the judge to warn the jury. The appellant’s submission must be that the trial judge of his own motion should have given a warning about Mr Brown’s unreliability because of the indemnity. That submission must be assessed in the light of the fact that s 164 provides: 
        
        
         
         “(1) It is not necessary that evidence on which a party relies be corroborated. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Subsection (1) does not affect the operation of a rule of law that requires corroboration with respect to the offence of perjury or a similar or related offence. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Despite any rule, whether of law or practice, to the contrary, but subject to the other provisions of this Act, if there is a jury, it is not necessary that the judge: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) warn the jury that it is dangerous to act on uncorroborated evidence or give a warning to the same or similar effect; or 
         
        
        
         
         (b) give a direction relating to the absence of corroboration.” 
         
        
        
       The test for leave 
       
     23 The appellant submitted that leave pursuant to r 4 should be granted because the error complained of, by reason of the significance of Mr Brown’s evidence, went to the “very root of the proceedings”, and if the point could not be raised there “would be a very real possibility of injustice”. He relied on R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195, where Yeldham J (Carruthers and McInerney JJ concurring) said, after considering numerous authorities: 
      
       
        
         
         “Although the court is obliged to be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law, … none the less, in my opinion, it should be astute also to ensure that points, especially those of little or no merit, which were not thought by counsel appearing at the trial to be of any great significance, should not be raised for the first time on appeal. Furthermore, the fact that no objection was taken at the trial is in many cases cogent evidence of the fact that, having regard to the atmosphere at the trial and the manner in which it was conducted, the matter later complained of was not regarded as being of significance, or likely to give rise to any miscarriage of justice. The authorities to which I have referred emphasise that the leave required by r 4 is not to be lightly granted. Generally speaking such leave will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings.” 
         
        
        
       The chronology of Mr Brown’s role 
       
     24 In considering the appellant’s submissions, it is convenient to bear in mind the following chronology of Mr Brown’s role.  
      
       
     25 On 7 February 1999 the deceased was allegedly killed. 
      
       
     26 On or about Saturday 20 February 1999, according to Mr Brown, the appellant confessed to him in the lounge bar of the “Middle Pub” Hotel, Mathoura, that he had shot the deceased three times with a 9 mm Browning pistol and killed her. 
      
       
     27 Around Easter 1999, according to Mr Brown, the appellant came to Mr Brown’s house and gave him his will: Mr Brown was executor and beneficiary. The appellant asked Mr Brown to look after his mother and one of his sisters. He also gave him a set of instructions for the stripping, cleaning and assembling of a 9mm Browning pistol.  
      
       
     28 On the first weekend of the year 2000, according to Mr Brown, the appellant told Mr Brown that the deceased’s remains had been discovered.  
      
       
     29 On 11 March 2000 Mr Brown was interviewed by the police at Belconnen Police Station. He gave them the appellant’s will and the Browning instructions, and he told them of the appellant’s confession. 
      
       
     30 On the following Friday, 17 March 2000, according to Mr Brown, he rang the appellant and told him he had told the police everything he knew. The appellant expressed displeasure, did not deny having confessed, but suggested that the confession was untrue. Mr Brown tape recorded that conversation. The police arrested the appellant at the conclusion of it. 
      
       
     31 On 8 August 2000 the Attorney-General granted Mr Brown an immunity from prosecution. 
      
       
       
       Was the playing of the taped 17 March 2000 conversation unfair? 
       
     32 It is convenient to deal first with the last of the appellant’s submissions set out above. There is no separate ground of appeal complaining about the trial judge’s decision to permit the Crown to play the tape recording of the 17 March 2000 telephone conversation while Mr Brown was being re-examined.  
      
       
     33 The trial judge, in ruling that the Crown could play the tape during Mr Brown’s re-examination, first quoted Mr Brown’s evidence in chief about the conversation: 
      
       
        
         
         “Evidence has also been given by Mr Brown of a telephone conversation that he had with the accused on 17 March 2000 in which he told he accused that he had told the police about the accused’s confession of February 1999. The evidence is as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. After you had that conversation with him, did you at a later stage in fact tell him that you had told the police about the conversation that you had with him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, that was the following Friday where I -- 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Just stopping you there. When you had that conversation with him was it a face to face conversation or how did you come to speak with him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. It was a telephone conversation. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. When you spoke with the accused on that occasion, can you tell us as accurately as possible what it was you said to him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I rang him to inform him that I had told the police -- 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. What did you say to him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. I told him I told the police everything that I knew.  
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. When you said that to him, did he reply to you? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. He replied initially with, he said something like: ‘Oh shit’ or ‘dam” or maybe something worse, along those lines, and then after he said that, he then said that, he told me what he told me to get respect out of me or get respect from me was the way he said, the way he told me. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Sir, was it the situation during the course of – sorry, do you know where the accused was when you were having this conversation with him? 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           A. Yes, he was at the Mathoura post office.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     34 The trial judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence of the conversation given by Mr Brown was a summary, and obviously the best evidence of what was said can be obtained by the playing of a tape. The transcript of the conversation, which is MFI 10, includes these references:

           Brown: Right, so I guess what I’m getting to in a nutshell is I’ve told the police everything 
           
          
         
        
         
       I know.

           Brown: … is if you go to gaol …

           Brown: and you’re in gaol for however long, whether it be fifteen years or twenty years … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Accused: Well see that’s why I’m starting to worry because why should I go to gaol for something I haven’t done.

           Brown: And if you’re telling me now that it’s not true well there you go but it certainly wasn’t the case a year ago …

           Brown: … alright, put that sort of pressure on me …

           Brown: … that’s a horrible thing to do to someone. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Accused: Yeah. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Brown: And you put me in a position where I’ve had to like compromise myself one way or the other. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Page 9 line 20: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Accused: Yep. But as I said you know I haven’t done nothin’ you know I just tried to get a little bit of respect back. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Brown: Okay well if that’s what it was now, if that’s what you’re saying now … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Accused: Yeah. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Brown: … well that’s that I guess but, I guess Kim (Mr Brown’s wife) knows what I’ve told the police … .” 
           
          
         
        
       
     35 This material was amply capable of being construed by the jury as containing prior statements consistent with Mr Brown’s evidence that the confession had been made, and recording admissions by the appellant that the confession had been made, as well as his explanation that the confession was not true.  
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     36 In view of the fact that the appellant submits that it was unfair to admit this evidence without further testing of Mr Brown in cross-examination, it is significant that after the tape was played Mr Stratton did not ask for leave further to cross-examine Mr Brown. This is so even though the transcript records the following events after the tape was played and Mr Brown identified his voice and the appellant’s voice: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: That’s the end of the re-examination? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Brown, you may step down you are excused from further attendance. 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS RETIRED AND EXCUSED SUBJECT TO RECALL 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Brown, I don’t know whether it’s likely that anyone may wish to ask you anything else but in case that arises would you be prepared to make yourself available to come back to Court? 
         
        
        
         
         BROWN: Yes, your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Obviously the Crown will know where you are. On that condition I will let you go for now.” 
         
        
       
     37 Further, it is significant that in his submissions opposing the playing of the tape Mr Stratton did not advance the contention now put that “there was considerable unfairness in this evidence being admitted in re-examination such that it could not be tested by further cross-examination”. Mr Stratton’s submissions are recorded as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “STRATTON: Your Honour, no doubt the questions I have asked Mr Brown were designed to destroy his credibility; that was the design anyway and the case of the accused as put by me in my opening and as put by me in cross-examination is that those, or the confession part of the conversation did not take place. That is the accused did not say he shot her, took her out to the forest and buried her and anything else in accordance with that confession. My case and my questioning was not along the lines a conversation didn’t take place. My questioning was on the basis a conversation did take place but it did not contain the confessional material. 
         
        
        
         
         If one looks at the telephone material it can’t be said what Mr Brown was talking about at pages 308 and 310, etc. What Mr Brown was saying in that conversation was: ‘I have told the police everything I know.’ With great respect, that could be anything. 
         
        
        
         
         Page 4 line 7 (read). That is not what is alleged to have been said in this confession. Page 5 line 8 (read). Line 13 (read). He is not saying: “I told the police that you told me you shot Lyn Lock, I have told the police you told me you took her out into this deserted area’, etc. There is nothing about that at all. All he is says is I told the police what you told me. That could be anything. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no reference in any of the conversation that what he is really talking about is what he has told your Honour and the jury in this case. It is left up in the air. It is not really consistent with anything. Page 9 line 20 (read). There is nothing to indicate what he is really trying to get a little bit of respect back from. There is nothing there to indicate: ‘I told all this just to get some respect from you’. If that was the type of conversation that was recorded in this transcript, then we do not know what Mr Brown is talking about, we don’t know what the accused is talking about. It is all supposition. It is stretching it too far to say that is what it has to refer to. It could be I suppose if it is said to refer to the conversations that I have alleged are fabrications, it is nothing more than a self-serving statement by the witness at a time after he has made his disclosure to the police.” 
         
        
       
     38 The trial judge summarised Mr Stratton’s arguments in his judgment of 11 April 2001 permitting the playing of the tape thus:  
      
       
        
         
         “It is submitted by Mr Stratton that the reference in the conversation may not be understood as referring to anything said by the accused on the occasion in the hotel described by Mr Brown. Everything, it is submitted, is left in the air. Reference is made to Mr Brown having said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Alright, well I’m telling you what you’ve – that I’ve told them everything that you told me 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         and to the accused’s having said that he tried to get a little bit of respect back. Respect from or about what, it is asked rhetorically. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted that there is nothing but supposition to support the contention that this telephone conversation refers to anything said by the accused to Mr Brown at the hotel. I do not agree. I think that seen as a whole the conversation is capable of being understood as referring to whatever it was that the accused said to Mr Brown at the hotel. 
         
        
        
         
         It is submitted in the alternative that, in any case, anything said by Mr Brown in the telephone conversation is no more than a self-serving statement made after Mr Brown made his statement to the police. That may be so, but it seems to me that s 108 is designed to make admissible such self-serving statements.” 
         
        
       
       
       The trial judge went on to deal with a consideration about which Mr Stratton did not make a submission: 
        
        
         
         “I have considered whether the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused outweighs the probative value of the evidence. I do not think that it does and I think, therefore, that s 137 does not make the evidence inadmissible. I would not refuse to receive the evidence in the exercise of my discretion.”  
         
        
       
     39 Not only did Mr Stratton not contend that any inability on his part to cross-examine Mr Brown further was unfair, but it is the case that such a submission would have been pointless. He probably would have been given leave to cross-examine Mr Brown on the conversation, but that carried the risk that Mr Brown would make its obscurities clearer. The appellant does not now challenge, and never did challenge, that he was a participant in the conversation. The playing of the tape was not unfair. And the playing of the tape did not increase any need for a “direction under s 165”.  
      
       
       
       The relevance of R v Chai 
       
     40 The case of R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 is central to the appellant’s submission. What is its relevance? In that case the accused was charged with conspiring with other persons to import heroin. One of the alleged co-conspirators, who was not indicted, was Mr Choy. Wood J convicted the accused. In the Court of Criminal Appeal Badgery-Parker J (Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J concurring) said at 157D-F: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown case depended almost entirely on the evidence of Choy, who had received immunity from prosecution in Hong Kong and in Australia and had entered into a plea bargain agreement with United States authorities. Although there was some evidence confirmatory of his account, and some material which the trial judge ruled was capable of constituting corroboration of his evidence, the Crown case could not succeed in the absence of acceptance by the jury of the evidence of Choy. Objection was taken to the reception of his evidence, both as a matter of admissibility and as a matter of discretion, and his Honour dealt with that objection in a voir dire hearing prior to the empanelling of the jury. His Honour admitted the evidence, and some time later, on 13 February, gave reasons for that decision. His Honour’s decision to admit the evidence is challenged in ground 1 in the grounds of appeal.” 
         
        
       
     41 Mr Choy, whom the Court of Criminal Appeal described as “a self-confessed international heroin dealer on a massive scale”, gave detailed evidence about a series of meetings with other conspirators including the accused over a period from at least May 1987 to August 1987. The accused appealed on numerous grounds.  
      
       
     42 The first was that the trial judge erred in admitting Mr Choy’s evidence. That ground failed: the Court declined to follow R v Pipe (1966) 51 Cr App R 17 but followed various other cases, including Australian cases, holding that there was no discretion to exclude the evidence of a witness indemnified from prosecution independent of the general discretion to exclude evidence unfairly prejudicial to the accused. (It may be noted that the present appellant does not advance any ground of appeal contending that Mr Brown’s evidence should have been excluded under s 135 or s 137, nor did Mr Stratton make any application to that effect at the trial. Apart from an objection to one half-question which was leading and one non-responsive answer, Mr Stratton made no objection to Mr Brown’s evidence in chief at all. His tactics, and the failure of the appellant to complain about the reception of Mr Brown’s evidence, of themselves point against the need for any warning of the type which it is now said should have been given.)  
      
       
     43 The part of R v Chai on which the appellant relies is that relating to Ground 5, which complained of Wood J’s directions about Mr Choy. The passage on which the appellant relies is as follows (at 176): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is of course abundantly clear that where the evidence of an accomplice is relied upon by the Crown, the jury must be clearly warned of the danger of convicting upon such evidence in the absence of corroboration and in any event unless they are satisfied that the evidence of the accomplice is true and reliable; and further, that where the accomplice has been granted immunity from prosecution, the significance of that in relation to the evaluation of the reliability of the witness’ testimony needs to be clearly explained to the jury. Consistently with that, this Court recognised in R v Booth [[1982] 2 NSWLR 847] the relevance and importance of evidence revealing to the jury all of the matters relevant to the position of the accomplice vis `a vis the Crown which is the party calling him. The corollary is that, such evidence having been given as it was here, the judge should be at pains to make clear to the jury the significance of it.” 
         
        
       
     44 However, it desirable also to set out the rest of Badgery-Parker J’s reasoning on Ground 5 (at 176-180): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is conceded on behalf of the appellant that his Honour gave the jury a warning which does not depart from the basic principles relating to warnings from the Bench in relation to accomplices. However it was submitted that the ruling was insufficient and failed to convey to the jury with sufficient force the particular dangers in this case in convicting the appellant on the evidence of Choy. Indeed, counsel went so far as to describe the direction given by his Honour as ‘a somewhat perfunctory direction, without special emphasis which was required to be given in this case as to the character of the witness Choy, his role in international drug dealing and the particularly unsafe aspects of his evidence both as an alleged accomplice and as a person who has received certain immunities who was still the subject of an inducement offered by United States authorities in the form of the yet incomplete plea bargaining and sentence arrangement’. It is undoubtedly the case that where circumstances revealed by the evidence go beyond merely the fact that the witness was an accomplice, the duty of a trial judge to direct the jury in respect of their approach to that evidence will not be discharged by some mere perfunctory recitation of standard formulae. It is necessary for the judge to bring home to the jury the reasons why the warning is given and to lay out for them the particular circumstances of the instant case which warrant their giving special scrutiny to the evidence of the accomplice witness. 
         
        
        
         
         That the summing-up should meet such criteria was emphasised by this Court in R v Checconi. There the trial judge had given a direction in what might be called ordinary form as to the danger of convicting upon the evidence of an accomplice in the absence of corroboration and as to the nature of corroboration and the evidence available in that case to be considered as such. The summing-up was criticised in regard to what was seen as a failure to separate, in a multi accused trial, that material which was available as corroboration in respect of each of the accused. That is not a question for consideration here. However, that aside, the Court took the view that in the circumstances of the particular case, more was required than the ‘ordinary form’ direction which was in fact given. Roden J with whom the other members of the Court agreed said (at 170-171): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘In the case of each of the appellants, the position was that unless Panozzo was accepted, there must be an acquittal. There is no rule of law that in every such case a direction in those terms should be given. It seems to me, however, that it is an appropriate direction to give. And when the accomplice evidence is as critical as it was here, it is desirable that more than the formal caution be given. If some explanation, or some reason for regarding the evidence as suspect, is given, the direction may be seen as more than a formal rule of law. Observations such as that the admitted criminality of the accomplice may make him less creditworthy, and that his participation in the offence may cause him to have his own reasons for wishing to implicate, or protect, others, may be appropriate. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           In this case, the fact that the accomplice gave evidence under immunity, rather than having already been dealt with for his part in the offence, is an additional factor capable of affecting the worth of his evidence. Again, there is no rule of law that calls for a direction with regard to that, but I am of the view that a full explanation to the jury of what was involved in weighing his evidence, required that something be said on that score.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His Honour then referred to R v Booth and extracted relevant passages from each of the three judgments there. He continued (at 171-172): 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Those observations were all made as the basis for the decision on admissibility, but they serve also to demonstrate the relevance of the witness’ position vis a vis the Crown, in determining the weight that can be given to his evidence, and whether it can safely be acted upon. Accordingly it seems to me that where, as here, the accomplice evidence is critical to verdict, and where, as here, the attack upon that evidence is the crux of the defence case, it is difficult, if not impossible, adequately to present or summarise that case to the jury, without referring to the accomplice’s position, a fortiori where, as here, the accomplice has benefited from his agreement to testify for the Crown.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         I would with respect agree with what was there stated and I accept that the present was a case which called for more than a perfunctory direction, a case which called for some elaboration of the reasons why the evidence of the particular witness should be treated as suspect and scrutinised with care, both because of his position as an accomplice and because of the plea bargaining transaction into which he had entered. 
         
        
        
         
         I cannot, however, accept the submission that the summing-up was in any way inadequate in this regard. With respect, it appears to me that Wood J was very much alive to the need to give just such directions as Roden J indicated were desirable or indeed necessary, and he proceeded to do everything that could reasonably be expected of him. His Honour emphasised to the jury that without Choy there would be no case and unless the jury believed Choy’s evidence they must acquit. He gave the usual warning as to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice. He went into considerable detail as to the reason why the evidence of an accomplice might be unreliable, and the reason why, in those circumstances, the warning was given. His Honour said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘There are no doubt many reasons why the evidence of accomplices may be unreliable and I am sure you can think of many yourselves. You may think it is only natural for an accomplice to want to shift the blame from himself to others, perhaps to downplay his role, perhaps to justify his own conduct. In that process the accomplice may construct an untruthful story, he may play up the part of others, he may even blame innocent people. Experience has shown that once an accomplice gives a version to the police, he may feel locked into that story and be unwilling to tell the truth later. Of course you may think, it is a matter for you, that the risk that an accomplice has told an untrue story may be greater where he has been offered a prospect of receiving some reward or immunity from prosecution either for himself or for someone else. It is a matter of commonsense. Freedom from prosecution either of an accomplice or someone else who is associated with him, either here or in some other place in return for giving evidence against an accused person, may – although necessarily will it do so – constitute an inducement or persuasion to give false evidence.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         His Honour continued over two further pages to emphasise the aspects of the immunity situation in the instant case and the need for the jury to consider the significance of the immunity. In my view to describe the directions as perfunctory is absurd. They were detailed, they were carefully constructed and it is not without significance that counsel at the trial sought no re-direction. Counsel for the appellant was quite unable to make clear to this Court what more was required. 
         
        
        
         
         In the appellant’s written submissions it is asserted that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The inadequacy of his Honour’s direction was compounded by remarks of his Honour such as, when referring to the accomplice direction, that: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            ‘There is nothing particular about this case which causes me to give it’.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         This submission is entirely misconceived. It is an essential part of the accomplice direction that, in fairness to the Crown, the trial judge make clear to the jury that the direction is not given because he has himself formed any view as to the reliability of the accomplice evidence. It is not for the judge to express a view himself about the reliability of an accomplice or of any other witness. The warning is given not because the judge has a particular view about the evidence in the particular case but because of the experience of the courts which has led to a conclusion that such evidence has, as a general category of evidence, particular aspects which may not be known to or understood by a jury. For the same reason, it appears to me that when a judge is called upon to perform the task imposed upon him by the recent decision of the High Court in McKinney v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468, it will be appropriate for him to make clear to the jury that he gives the warning, not because he has himself formed a view as to the reliability or credibility of the police officers whose evidence is under consideration but because the law requires such a direction in every case. The requirement of the law that the trial judge warn the jury about the risks associated with accomplice evidence and, in the view of the High Court, the evidence of police officers, stems from the perception that juries may not be aware of the matters that affect evidence of such witnesses as a class. It is incumbent on the judge, in order to hold the balance evenly between the Crown and the accused, that he or she make clear that the warning does not stem from his or her own assessment of the reliability of the evidence in the particular case. 
         
        
        
         
         It is also appropriate to remark that the adequacy of directions given in respect of a particular matter arising in the course of a trial has to be judged in the light of the way the case was conducted and in the light of counsel’s addresses. The matters now under discussion were exposed at great length in the course of cross-examination and it can scarcely be doubted that they received a great deal of attention in the course of counsel’s addresses. It is in the light of those addresses that the judge’s directions are to be evaluated, and it is therefore appropriate to give particular weight to the fact that counsel at the trial had no complaint. 
         
        
        
         
         Not only did his Honour on the first day of his summing-up deal extensively with the relevance of the fact that the witness was an accomplice and of the fact that he had been granted immunity, in much the way that Roden J in R v Checconi advocated, he briefly returned to the matter at the commencement of the second day of his summing-up. He said:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Let me remind you that in the cross-examination of Choy there emerged various pieces of evidence to the effect that he had been involved with Lai and Mrs Ling in heroin dealings in the United States. I should caution you that that is not a matter which is relied upon by the Crown nor could it be relied upon by the Crown as a fact tending to show that the conspiracy charged in this case existed. Logically it could not do so because it relates to an entirely different matter. Its relevance and its only relevance in this trial is for you to take into account as a matter concerning the credibility of Choy. You should take it into account and give it such weight as you think fit having regard to the fact that he admitted to having been involved in the heroin trade in the United States with those other persons and is a person who has an interest to serve having regard to the fact that he entered into a deal with the authorities and still faces a sentence on one charge in the States. Therefore, you should not use that evidence as a fact relied upon by the Crown as tending to show that the conspiracy here charged existed but only should have regard to it so far as it affects the credibility of Choy.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         No request for any further re-direction or any amendment of these directions having been sought by counsel for the appellant at the trial, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. The appellant requires leave to rely upon this ground and such leave will not readily be granted: see R v Tripodina and Morabito (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 195; R v Williamson and Morell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 October 1991, unreported). In my opinion, in this case leave to rely on the fifth ground of appeal should be refused.” 
         
        
       
     45 For the moment three key points in this reasoning may be noted. First, Mr Choy was an “accomplice”. Secondly, it was said that the “significance” of the “grant of immunity from prosecution” in relation to the “evaluation of the reliability of the witness’ testimony needs” to be explained. But, thirdly, that “need” was not a rule of law, according to R v Checconi. In evaluating the reasoning, a fourth point is to be remembered: R v Chai was decided on the common law, not on the Evidence Act 1995. 
      
       
       
       Who is a relevant accomplice? 
       
     46 What sort of “accomplice” is the reasoning in R v Chai concerned with? Mr Choy was not charged with the actual importation of the heroin. The actual importer was a Nicaraguan diplomat from whom the accused took delivery. Mr Choy played a significant role in arranging the importation. Thus Mr Choy was an accessory before the fact. Similarly, in R v Checconi (1988) 34 A Crim R 160 a case involving charges of conspiracy to cultivate Indian hemp, the “accomplice” was an accessory before the fact, a co-conspirator: he had been actively engaged in cultivation. And in R v Booth [1982] 2 NSWLR 847 the witnesses were co-conspirators.  
      
       
     47 R v Chai thus dealt with only one of the types of accomplice known to the general law in relation to corroboration warnings.  
      
       
     48 In R v Stewart [2001] NSWCA 260 at [2]-[17] Spigelman CJ questioned, without finally ruling out, the utility of examining the common law on accomplices in applying s 165(1)(d). It is necessary in the present appeal to examine aspects of the common law, not necessarily because it aids in the construction of s 165(1)(d), but because the appellant’s argument depends on an appeal to the common law, or to an analogy with it.  
      
       
     49 The passages from R v Chai quoted above reveal that that case dealt with only one of the types of accomplice known to the common law in relation to corroboration warnings. In Davies v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] AC 378 at 400 Lord Simonds LC, with whom Lords Porter, Oaksey, Tucker and Asquith of Bishopstone concurred, said that the common law rules as to accomplice warnings applied to three classes of “accomplice”: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) On any view, persons who are participes criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, whether as principals or accessories before or after the fact (in felonies) or persons committing, procuring or aiding and abetting (in the case of misdemeanors). This is surely the natural and primary meaning of the term ‘accomplice.’ But in two cases, persons falling strictly outside the ambit of this category have, in particular decisions, been held to be accomplices for the purpose of the rule: viz.: 
         
        
        
         
         (2) Receivers have been held to be accomplices of the thieves from whom they receive goods on a trial of the latter for larceny … : 
         
        
        
         
         (3) When X has been charged with a specific offence on a particular occasion, and evidence is admissible, and has been admitted, of his having committed crimes of this identical type on other occasions, as proving system and intent and negativing accident; in such cases the court has held that in relation to such other similar offences, if evidence of them were given by parties to them, the evidence of such other parties should not be left to the jury without a warning that it is dangerous to accept it without corroboration.” 
         
        
       
     50 So far as this went beyond principals and accessories before the fact, it was a dictum, because the witness in question was, if an accomplice of any kind, either an accessory before the fact or a principal. And so far as this definition included accessories after the fact, it has not been accepted in Victoria either before Davies’ case (R v Ready [1942] VLR 85 at 93 per Mann CJ, Gavan Duffy and Martin JJ) or after it (R v Carranceja (1989) 42 A Crim R 402 at 417 (Murphy, Marks and Gobbo JJ)). It has not been accepted in Western Australia either before Davies’ case (R v Lewis (1906) 8 WALR 83 (Parker CJ, McMillan and Burnside JJ)) or after it (Khan v R [1971] WAR 44 (Virtue SPJ, Nevile and Burt JJ)). And it has not been accepted in Tasmania (R v Ling (1982) 6 A Crim R 429 at 449 per Crawford J). There is in New South Wales what is no more than a passing dictum accepting paragraph (1) of Lord Simonds LC’s definition: R v Perry [1970] 2 NSWR 501 at 504 per Manning JA, Brereton and Begg JJ. Against that stands an actual decision on the point, though it is old and unreported: R v Mason (1869) 5 Aust Digest pp 881-2.  
      
       
     51 The reason why Australian courts have not followed Lord Simonds LC’s inclusion of accessories after the fact was put thus in R v Ready [1942] VLR 85 at 93: 
      
       
        
         
         “In our opinion a person who knows nothing of the crime until it has been committed and is therefore not privy to it before its committal and then ‘receives, relieves, comforts or assists’ the principal criminal does not fall within the reason of the rule which requires corroboration of the evidence of accomplices and unless required by authority to do so we should not think it proper to insist on such corroboration. An accessory after the fact takes no part in the acts which constitute the principal crime. The rule in question recognises the temptation presented to an accused person to buy his own immunity from punishment by offering what is called King’s evidence, true or false, against the alleged co-offender. Such a temptation does not exist in the same way in the case of an accessory after the fact, whose interest lies in establishing, if he can, the innocence of the alleged principal offender.” 
         
        
       
       
       Similarly in  
       R v Gratton 
        (1971) 4 NBR (2d) 14 at 16-17 Limerick JA (Bridges CJNB and Hughes JA concurring) said: 
        
        
         
         “The reason for the origin of the rule of practice, which has obtained such universal acceptance that it is regarded as mandatory and of the same effect as if it was a rule of law and not of practice, is because of the danger, implicit in the evidence of an accomplice that he may try to fasten the blame on someone else to mitigate his own involvement. Such reasoning does not apply to an accessory after the fact. By testifying against the perpetrator of the crime he is giving evidence against his own interest, he cannot be convicted as an accessory unless the person he aids or assists in escaping detection be found guilty.” 
         
        
        
       See also  
       R v Robichaud 
        (1938) 13 MPR 22 at 36 per Baxter CJ, Grimmer and Harrison JJ concurring.  
        
       
     52 The purpose of the common law accomplice rule was to guard against the danger of fabrication. “The danger is, that when a man is fixed, and knows that his own guilt is detected, he purchases impunity by falsely accusing others”: R v Farler  (1837) 8 C & P 106 at 108; 173 ER 418 at 419 per Lord Abinger CB. In R v Sneesby [1951] Qd R 26 at 28 Philp J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The reason for the rule … is that an accomplice is a person who would be likely to lie in order to save his own neck, or his own liberty. Lord Macaulay says somewhere that an accomplice giving evidence is like ‘a cormorant fishing for prey with a rope around his neck.’ It is fair to assume that an accomplice may be induced to lie in order to get a pardon, or to get immunity from prosecution, or, perhaps, lesser punishment.” 
         
        
       
       
       It is necessary to bear these considerations in mind in considering whether an appeal to  
       R v Chai 
        is relevant in deciding whether a s 165(1)(d) warning should have been given here.  
        
        
       Accessories after the fact 
       
     53 Even if it is assumed that accessories after the fact were accomplices for the purposes of the pre 1995 law in this State, was Mr Brown an accessory after the fact? An accessory after the fact at common law must assist “the principal offender by a physical act and not merely by omitting to do something”: Majara v R [1954] AC 235 at 238 per Lord Goddard CJ, Lord Reid and Mr L M D de Silva. The accessory must “receive, relieve, comfort or assist” the principal offender and “merely suffering the principal to escape” will not suffice, nor will “the negative assistance of not giving information to the police”: R v Ready [1942] VLR 85 at 92-3 per Mann CJ, Gavan Duffy and Martin JJ. Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd ed, 1961) pp 409-411 states: 
      
       
        
         
         “An accessory after the fact is one who assists a felon after his crime, with a view to shielding him from justice … . 
         
        
        
         
         An accessory after the fact is defined as one who ‘receives, harbours or maintains’ a known felon so as to enable him to elude justice (ie, arrest, trial or punishment). Examples are hiding the felon from justice, acting with the purpose of enabling him to escape before or after arrest, or even the mere act of removing the evidence against him. …  
         
        
        
         
         To constitute a man an accessory after the fact he must commit a positive act of assistance. Mere failure to inform the authorities, or failure to prevent an escape, is not sufficient.” 
         
        
       
       
       In Stephen,  
       A Digest of the Criminal Law (Indictable Offences)  
       (9th ed, 1950) Art 25 provides: 
        
        
         
         “Every one is an accessory after the fact to felony who knowing a felony to have been committed by another receives, comforts, or assists him, in order to enable him to escape from punishment; or rescues him from an arrest for the felony; or having him in custody for the felony, intentionally and voluntarily suffers him to escape; or opposes his apprehension.” 
         
        
        
       There must be a “desire to assist the principal felon”:  
       R v Tevendale 
        [1955] VLR 95 at 97 per Sholl J.  
        
       
     54 Mr Brown gave the following evidence in chief: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did the accused on that evening seek your advice about any matter? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, he sought my advice on what to do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What – how did he come to seek your advice about what to do? What did he say to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. He said to me, I’m not sure exactly what he said to me to ask me my advice, he may have just simply asked what he should do, I don’t recall the conversation leading up to me giving the advice. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you give him some advice on this evening? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, I did, 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What advice did you give him? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I told him that to continue on as if, as normal, as if nothing has occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Don’t act suspicious about it because if you act suspicious about it people would wonder why you were so concerned about it, that was the type of advice I gave him. I gave him advice to help him to not get caught, is the advice I was giving him to do for the crime he had committed.” 
         
        
       
     55 In cross-examination Mr Brown said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Yeah, we spoke about, like, about how he was, you know, having trouble sleeping at night. I gave him suggestions and advice. I wanted to gain his trust at that time because I wasn’t trusting him, so I gave him advice on how to act and behave so that he wouldn’t be obvious about what he had done. I thought he would be very obvious about what he had done, I didn’t think, and, yeah, that was what we were talking about back at his place.” 
         
        
       
     56 It must be questioned whether that is sufficient assistance to have made Mr Brown an accessory after the fact. In particular, it must be questioned whether that was “a physical act” or “a positive act of assistance”. And it may be questioned whether Mr Brown’s desire was to assist the appellant: there is no direct evidence that it was.  
      
       
     57 It was incumbent on the appellant to elicit evidence at the trial which made it appropriate to treat Mr Brown as falling within the description in s 165(1)(d). The examination in chief of Mr Brown concluded with the tender by the Crown of the indemnity. That tender occurred after the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Sir, you were told by the accused you say in February of 1999 that he had committed this offence? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It was not until March 2000 that you provided any information in that regard to police, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was there a reason that you did not provide this information to police prior to March 2000? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes, there was. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What was that reason? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I had concern for my own safety. There was no body that was found and, to me, if Steven was going to murder people that crossed him I wanted to be sure if I was going to say anything that there was evidence, there was a body, there was a crime, otherwise I was just going to have a story about a person that was missing. So, to me, it was, it was very, very important a body had been found. I had fears for my own well being, I wanted to be sure if I said anything, I wanted Steven arrested fairly quickly and put behind bars. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You understood, did you, that retaining this information and keeping it to yourself may constitute a criminal offence? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was fully aware of that, yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you receive in relation to that matter an indemnity that there would be no prosecution in that regard? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I understand that I have indemnity in this matter except for murder is what I understand.” 
         
        
       
       
       In cross-examination Mr Brown repeated his evidence that in keeping the confession to himself he knew he was possibly committing a criminal offence. He also repeated his reasons for silence. Mr Brown was at no stage asked to explain what criminal offence he thought he had committed. Perhaps he had in mind the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900, s 316(1), which in its present form provides: 
        
        
         
         “If a person has committed a serious indictable offence and another person who knows or believes that the offence has been committed and that he or she has information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension of the offender or the prosecution or conviction of the offender for it fails without reasonable excuse to bring that information to the attention of a member of the Police Force or other appropriate authority, that other person is liable to imprisonment for 2 years.” 
         
        
        
       The section was in similar but not identical form in 1999. Perhaps Mr Brown thought there was some general duty enforceable by a criminal sanction to go to the police with any information he had of the kind formerly punishable as misprision of felony: see  
       R v Wozniak 
        (1988) 16 NSWLR 185. At all events, the indemnity was in the following terms: 
        
         
        
        
         
         “If you actively co-operate in criminal proceedings pending against Steven John Clark for the offence of murder and if your evidence there is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I grant you indemnity from prosecution for: 
         
        
        
         
         1. Concealing a serious offence; or 
         
        
        
         
         2. any associated offence except the offence of murder in respect of matters relevant to the proceedings and covered by your evidence at the trial.” 
         
        
        
       Apart from suggesting that s 316 of the  
       Crimes Act 
        was in the Attorney-General’s mind, the indemnity casts no light on what Mr Brown was worried about. 
        
        
       Tactical considerations affecting the cross-examination of Mr Brown 
       
     58 Mr Stratton faced a difficult task in deciding how he should cross-examine Mr Brown. His tactics appear to have been controlled by one matter. At the time when the cross-examination took place, there was no specific evidence before the jury of the conversation between Mr Brown and the appellant on the telephone on 17 March 2000: the only evidence of that conversation was very general evidence in chief. Mr Stratton put matters suggesting not only that Mr Brown misunderstood what had been said but was lying in saying that there had been a confession. To a large extent these tactics were available tactics so long as the jury did not hear the tape of the 17 March 2000 conversation, in which the appellant admitted, or so the jury might reasonably find, that there had been a confession. Thereafter those tactics would be much less likely to succeed. But it must have been thought possible at the time when Mr Brown was being cross-examined that the defence would be able to keep the tape recording out or minimise its significance.  
      
       
     59 Mr Stratton adopted the following lines in cross-examination which were apparently directed to establishing that nothing was said: 
      
       
       
       (a) Mr Brown lacked any record of meeting the appellant on 20 February 1999, so that no meeting took place; 
        
        
       (b) Mr Brown had some motive to tell the police, falsely, that there was a confession, such as: 
        
        
        (i) the fact that they suspected Mr Brown; 
        
        
        (ii) the fact that they told Mr Brown his car had been seen with 
        
        him in it in Mathoura on 7 February 1999; 
        
        
         
         (iii) the fact that Mr Brown owed the appellant money, that Microsoft had fined the appellant for a dereliction in the way he sold its products, that the appellant wanted a contribution to the fine from Mr Brown, and that if these amounts were not paid the appellant would report these matters to Microsoft, a supplier to Mr Brown’s business, as a means of destroying that business;  
         
        
        
       (c) the fact that Mr Brown did not tell the police or anyone else, even his wife, about the confession until March 2000 showed that it was never made; 
        
        
       (d) the fact that there were divergences between Mr Brown’s testimony to the jury, his evidence at the committal proceedings, and his interview with the police established fabrication; 
        
        
       (e) the fact that he kept associating with the appellant suggests that nothing incriminating was ever said by the appellant. 
        
       
     60 The lines in cross-examination directed to establishing that even if something was said, either it was not seriously meant by the appellant or it was misconstrued by Mr Brown included: 
      
       
       
       (a) Mr Brown was drunk on 20 February 1999 and must have misunderstood what was said, or remembered it defectively; 
        
        
       (b) Mr Brown smoked marijuana on the night of 20 February 1999, and this caused him to remember events on that evening defectively; 
        
        
       (c) the appellant, whose injuries caused him to be affected by alcohol very easily, was drunk, and hence unlikely to be truthful; 
        
        
       (d) the divergences in Mr Brown’s versions suggested poor perception or memory. 
        
       
     61 After the tape was played, it was open to the jury to reject all these lines of cross-examination, leaving open only the possibility that the appellant had deliberately made a false confession, because the tape supported Mr Brown’s evidence that there had been a confession, and recorded an admission by the appellant that there had been one. From that moment on, it became very difficult for the defence to contend that there had never been a meeting on 20 February 1999 or that nothing capable of being understood as a confession was said. The defence had to maintain the latter line, because the appellant denied making the confession in the witness box save for a joke described as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Have you got any recollection at all of ever saying to Mr Brown at the hotel, ‘I killed Lyn Lock’ or words to that effect? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Never, never said those words but one weekend he, when he was there, there was a hell lot of joking and jovial stuff going on and I was joking around and I wasn’t denying the fact that some incident happened, no-one knew what it was so I just joked along with them and then as soon as we got to the front door and as we were leaving and he turned to me and said, ‘Well, is that what happened? Did you [do] it?’ and I just thought, you know, this is my best mate and he is questioning me like this so I turned around and said Yes because nothing else jumped into me head so I said Yes.” 
         
        
       
       
       The appellant also said, in explaining the tape of the 17 March 2000 conversation: 
        
        
         
         “Well, when he said, ‘I’ve told the police everything’, well, all I could think of all he knew was I’ve been at the pub and everybody was just joking with me and ribbing me and everything like that, well when he got to the door he just said ‘yes’; he’s supposed to be me best mate and he has done all this to me; I mean, so he’s just said that, I mean, but never in any phone conversation have I ever mentioned anything like he’s recollected, like I said, because that didn’t occur.” 
         
        
       
     62 An issue between Mr Brown and the appellant as to whether the former misunderstood a joke and added numerous false details raises different considerations from an allegation that the gentlemen had never met at the right time or that the appellant had never said anything material at all. Incidentally, the proposition later advanced by the appellant in his evidence in chief that he jokingly told Mr Brown that he had killed the deceased was not a proposition put in terms by Mr Stratton to Mr Brown, which may have assisted the jury in rejecting the appellant’s evidence: Pearmine v R [1988] WAR 315 at 320 per Kennedy J. This circumstance was pointed out by Crown counsel after cross-examination had ceased and before re-examination began, but there was no application for leave to ask further questions in cross-examination with a view to having Mr Brown’s evidence about what became the appellant’s contention.  
      
       
     63 One aspect of the cross-examination of Mr Brown is striking, however. The appellant’s present submission is that Mr Brown was a witness “who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding”, and that in consequence his evidence was of a kind which might be unreliable. If Mr Brown’s failure to report the confession speedily to the police is within those quoted words, Mr Stratton certainly cross-examined Mr Brown about that failure. But he did not ever suggest that Mr Brown was criminally concerned in the actual killing. He never suggested that Mr Brown was seeking to escape trial and conviction for the killing for falsely blaming the appellant. All he put was that Mr Brown thought the police were coming to see him because he had heard he was “some sort of a suspect too”, and when they came they told him that a brown HQ station wagon had been seen in Mathoura on the weekend of 7 February 1999, and that someone reported she had seen Mr Brown in it, to which Mr Brown said he did not own a car of that type and had not been there that weekend. “So that was the end of it. I wasn’t concerned”. The fact that the guilt of Mr Brown was not in question is supported by the trial judge’s direction to the jury that that report to the police “is not put forward at this trial as having any credibility”. Counsel for the appellant conceded during oral argument on the appeal that at the trial “it was accepted he was excluded from suspicion in relation to the murder or anything to do physically with that murder”.  
      
       
       
       The failure to cross-examine Mr Brown on his guilt and on the impact of the indemnity 
        
       
     64 If the trial judge were to be invited by Mr Stratton to direct the jury that Mr Brown’s evidence was of an unreliable kind because he was implicated in the killing and because he had received an indemnity against prosecution, it would have been necessary for Mr Stratton to address the jury along those lines, and nothing in the trial judge’s summing up suggests that he did. More importantly, it would have been necessary for Mr Stratton to have elicited evidence along those lines, or at least put questions, the answers to which, if exculpatory of Mr Brown, could have been disbelieved by the jury. But, as counsel for the appellant accepted during oral argument, Mr Stratton put no question suggesting that Mr Brown was guilty. So far as he put questions suggesting that Mr Brown feared being charged, they were of the briefest kind. He put no questions about the impact of the indemnity on Mr Brown’s truthfulness. That is a fatal gap in view of the fact that the appellant now relies on R v Chai, because a key element in the reasoning in that case is the question of the “significance” the “grant of immunity from prosecution” had in relation to the “evaluation of the reliability of the witness’ testimony”. For example, it was not suggested to Mr Brown that he would not get the indemnity unless he maintained in the witness box his lying story to the police about the confession, and that was the reason why he was lying about the confession on oath. The absence of any testimonial exploration of that question in the cross-examination of Mr Brown is extremely damaging to the present argument.  
      
       
     65 Thus the failure of Mr Stratton to ask for the direction which the appellant now says should have been given was not some unfortunate oversight. It was inherent in the whole way the defence ran the trial. And the defence tactics at the trial were understandable and perhaps inevitable: first, Mr Stratton apparently had no material suggesting that Mr Brown was guilty of the killing, and, secondly, to suggest that Mr Brown was guilty of the killing might have a most damaging aspect on the appellant’s position in that it would be likely to attract jury sympathy towards Mr Brown and arouse jury antipathy against the appellant. The materials suggest the conclusion that Mr Stratton very wisely avoided that type of frontal assault on Mr Brown and confined himself to trying to raise a reasonable doubt about Mr Brown’s reliability on matters of detail. The failure to question about the indemnity is also understandable. The indemnity was not an indemnity from a murder charge, but there was no evidence that Mr Brown had committed murder. The indemnity was an indemnity from charges short of murder, but for Mr Stratton to have cross-examined about crimes short of murder and the significance of being indemnified against prosecution for them might have struck the jury as a foolish and suspicious attempt to create a red herring being perpetrated by a barrister conscious of his client’s guilt. 
      
       
       
       The failure to demonstrate that Mr Brown’s evidence was of an unreliable kind 
         
        
       
     66 Let it be assumed that Mr Brown could have been charged as an accessory after the fact (which is questionable). Let it be assumed that he feared being charged with concealing a serious offence or with some crime in the nature of misprision of felony (which was not explored). Let it be assumed that his concealment of a serious offence caused him to fall within the language of s 165(1)(d) (which is a controversial construction). Even on those assumptions, it was not in Mr Brown’s interests falsely to fasten the death of the deceased onto the appellant. It would have been in his interests as much as those of his friend, the appellant, if the deceased had died of natural causes or at someone else’s hand. He could gain nothing by establishing the appellant’s guilt. He could bring nothing but trouble upon himself by doing so. There was nothing to suggest that his evidence fell within a “kind” that was unreliable.  
      
       
     67 One of the dangerous aspects of accomplice evidence which the general law recognised is that “an accomplice is not merely a witness with a possible motive to tell lies about an innocent accused but is such a witness peculiarly equipped, by reason of his inside knowledge of the crime, to convince the unwary that his lies are the truth”: R v Ncanana 1948 (4) SA 399 at 405 per Schreiner JA (Centlivres JA and Hoexter AJA concurring). Lord Abinger CB made a similar point in R v Farler (1837) 8 C & P 106 at 108; 173 ER 418 at 419:  
      
       
        
         
         “A man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only on the truth of that history, without identifying the persons, that is really no corroboration at all. If a man was to break open a house and put a knife to your throat, and steal your property, it would be no corroboration that he had stated all the facts correctly, that he had described how the person did put a knife to the throat, and did steal the property. It would not at all tend to shew that the party accused participated in it.” 
         
        
       
     68 These considerations caused Sholl J to suggest one qualification to the approach advanced in R v Ready excluding all accessories after the fact from the field of accomplices on the ground that their interests were coincident with those of the accused. In McNee v Kay [1953] VLR 520 at 530 he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whether that would always be so may perhaps be doubted when one considers the possible and by no means improbable case of a witness seeking to minimise his own part in a crime, from which he cannot in the circumstances hope entirely to dissociate himself, by reducing it from that of principal or of accessory before the fact to that of accessory after the fact, by falsifying or exaggerating in evidence the part played by his associates, or reversing his part and theirs. However that may be, if I were free so to hold, I should consider the true principle to be that that person is an accomplice within the common law rule who is chargeable, in relation to the same events as those founding the charge against the accused, with an offence (whether the same offence or not) of such a character, and who would be if convicted thereof liable to such punishment, as might possibly tempt that person to exaggerate or fabricate evidence as to the guilt of the accused.” 
         
        
       
     69 That reasoning has no application here. Mr Brown had no role in the crime. He had no “part” which could be reversed with that of the appellant. He gave no direct evidence of the appellant’s role in the crime which could be exaggerated. He was not peculiarly equipped with any inside knowledge. He knew nothing in particular about the facts of the death. Rather his evidence was of a confession which the appellant, in the telephone conversation of 17 March 2000, admitted making: the appellant did not deny it, he did not say that he had been misunderstood, he simply said that he had been untruthful. Any offence of which Mr Brown might have been convicted was not one which would tempt him to exaggerate or fabricate evidence about the appellant’s guilt. 
      
       
     70 As far as the appellant’s argument focuses on the language of paragraph (d) of s 165(1) there is no evidence that Mr Brown fell within those words if they are construed as limited to events up to the moment when the crime charged was complete, namely the death of the deceased on 7 February 1999. If that language extends to events after that time, which is a controversial question that need not now be decided, while Mr Brown may reasonably be supposed to have contravened s 316(1), it is arguable that his silence was not an event giving rise to the proceedings, but, as it were, a “non event” tending to prevent them from arising. However, even if Mr Brown’s silence brings him within s 165(1)(d), or even if he is within that paragraph on the ground that he may have been an accessory after the fact by telling the appellant to behave normally, the language of paragraph (d) must be read in the light of the opening words of s 165. The issue is not limited to whether Mr Brown is a witness within the language of paragraph (d), but whether the evidence which he, being a s 165(1)(d) witness, gave was “of a kind that may be unreliable”. That is, the opening words of s 165(1) qualify paragraph (d).  
      
       
     71 Whether Mr Brown’s evidence was of that “kind” depends on the circumstances. He gave evidence in chief about the reasons for his failure to inform the police of the appellant’s confession. He repeated them in cross-examination. He was not shaken in his explanation. His account of the confession was confirmed by the tape of the conversation of 17 March 2000 admitted in re-examination. It was also corroborated to some extent by the appellant’s handing over of the will and the Browning instructions, and by other matters. None of these things meant that the jury had to accept Mr Brown. His evidence was open to various criticisms, all of which Mr Stratton seems to have made. The idiosyncrasies and particular potential deficiencies of a given witness do not of themselves make that witness a member of a “kind”, and even if they do, the trial judge repeatedly exposed those idiosyncrasies and particular deficiencies.  
      
       
     72 In R v Stewart [2001] NSWCCA 260 at [16] Spigelman CJ said, without deciding, that “kind” in s 165(1) should be read down. 
      
       
        
         
         “The word ‘kind’ is a word of breadth and generality which it may be appropriate to read down.  
         Any 
          reason that could be advanced for questioning the reliability of evidence in the specific circumstances of a case can be stated at different levels of generality. Once stated at a level of generality higher than the specific facts of a particular case, such a reason could satisfy the description of ‘a kind’ of evidence. That would have the result that in  
         every case 
          in which an assertion of lack of reliability is made, the compulsory provisions for a warning on request in s 165(2) would apply, subject only to the exception in s 165(3). The acknowledgment, in s 165(5) that there will be other circumstances in which a judge will be required to warn or inform the jury with respect to these matters, suggests that the word ‘kind’ must be read down in some way.” 
         
        
       
     73 Beyond pointing to potential defects which the trial judge more than adequately highlighted, the appellant did not explain which relevant “kind” Mr Brown fell into. He did not explain how the indemnity made him unreliable, or how the characteristics which arguably placed him within paragraph (d) of s 165(1) made him unreliable. It cannot be the law that the evidence of every particular witness who receives an indemnity, or answers the language of s 165(1)(d), automatically and without any further inquiry must be held to be within a particular “kind” of evidence that may be unreliable. If Mr Brown was unreliable, it was because of the peculiar details of his stories. It was not because of s 316 or because he may have been an accessory after the fact, and it was not because of the indemnity. The indemnity protected him against unimportant crimes he may have committed. It did not protect him against being prosecuted as a principal or an accessory before the fact in relation to the crime of murder, but the appellant never suggested that Mr Brown had any complicity of those kinds in murder. The present case is totally different from R v Chai. 
      
       
        
       The form of the suggested directions 
       
     74 In Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425, an appeal in relation to a defamation case tried by jury, McHugh JA said at 440 (Samuels JA concurring): 
      
       
        
         
         “Counsel for the second defendant did not expressly ask for a direction that the learned judge should direct the jury as to the criteria for determining whether or not the conduct of the defendants was improper or unjustifiable or lacking in bona fides.  
         
        
        
         
         If a party is to rely as a ground of appeal on a misdirection in the summing-up, his counsel must specify at the trial that portion of the summing-up which he requires to be withdrawn. If any further direction is needed, counsel must specify with precision what direction the trial judge should give.” 
         
        
       
       
       The same duty applies in criminal cases tried by jury. It is less frequently observed than it should be. However, the merits of submissions about missing directions must be tested against the detail of what it is submitted on appeal might have been said at trial. On being asked to formulate the relevant directions in precise terms, counsel for the appellant responded: 
        
        
         
         “the evidence of Mr Brown may be unreliable due to the fact that he was given an indemnity.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel for the appellant then referred to the importance of giving directions about a witness who had been given a reduced sentence for co-operating with the Crown. He cited  
       R v Stewart 
        [2001] NSWCCA 260 at [141]-[145]. He then said that the trial judge should have explained the nature of the indemnity, and “should have indicated that the Courts over the years have given indemnities to people in situations.” Perhaps “the Courts” is a mistranscription for “the Crown” or “the prosecuting authorities”.  
        
       
     75 So far as indemnities in the nature of reduced sentences are concerned, in R v Stewart Howie J actually said that the fact of there being evidence of the witness having received a benefit for giving evidence diminished the need for any warning. In any event that circumstance is quite different from the present case. The remainder of the suggested direction lacks any meaningful content. While directions or warnings should be given if a failure to do so might cause a miscarriage of justice or some unfairness in the trial, and while they are commonly given to warn the jury against some danger not readily apparent to them, the suggested direction did not point to any danger, apparent or otherwise, against which the jury should have been on guard. To have given the direction suggested could have puzzled the jury and would have brought no legitimate benefit to the appellant. That is no doubt another reason why Mr Stratton did not ask for it.  
      
       
     76 Leave to argue that there should have been a direction about the indemnity should be refused. In consequence the first two grounds of appeal are rejected. 
      
       
        
       Grounds 3 and 4: relationship evidence 
        
       The grounds 
       
     77 These grounds are: 
      
       
        
         
         “3. His Honour erred in permitting evidence of a relationship between the deceased and the accused to be given by a number of witnesses. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The evidence of Mrs Wilson and others should not have been permitted to before the jury as evidence of the fact pursuant to s 65(2) Evidence Act”. 
         
        
       
     78 In oral argument ground 4 was abandoned. That in turn meant that complaints about the reception of evidence that the deceased was seen to have a black eye and other injuries and was heard to say that the appellant had injured her were withdrawn.  
      
       
        
       
       
       The evidence 
       
     79 The following passages from the evidence of five witnesses were identified as being inadmissible.  
      
       
     80 Judith Sellars (formerly known as Cooke) gave the following evidence which was said to be inadmissible. It took place in a conversation between her and the deceased about a week before 7 February 1999. 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did she tell you how she felt about the accused or what her attitude was to the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Lyn did not like the accused at all.” 
         
        
       
     81 Mrs Robertson gave the following evidence. It was placed in a time frame of four to five weeks before 7 February 1999.  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you from time to time talk to Miss Lock about the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Only that she was very, very scared of him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How did she come to say that to you, that she was scared of the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, I did see her with a black eye and she did tell me that Nobby, as they used to call him, had given her a black eye. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she tell you on any occasion that she was afraid of the accused, scared of the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, and she said that she was scared Nobby was around the house because she was stopping there on her own.” 
         
        
       
       
       The first and third questions and answers were said to be inadmissible.  
        
       
     82 Mr Williams gave the following evidence about a telephone call he received from the deceased on an evening in January 1999.  
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did she say anything to you in relation to the accused Mr Clark? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. As best you can recollect using the words that Miss Lock used, what did she say to you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just that she had been bashed by that particular person on an occasion and I told her to report that to the police and she said she wouldn’t, couldn’t be bothered. Then she spoke on about different things. I wasn’t really interested because it had nothing to do with me. I don’t even know why she rang me but she did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you know where she was living at that time? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Nobby’s mum’s place Nolene Clark. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she say anything about if she was going to continue living at that address? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said they wanted her out of the house. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she say ‘they’ or give a name to the person? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said Nobby wants her out of the house, one of her daughters. I never took a lot of notice of what she was going on about at that particular time. They just wanted her out of the house and she said to me her friend in the house was in hospital and I said: ‘Wait till she’s out of the hospital. It has nothing to do with me, wait and have a talk with her.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. How long did this conversation with Miss Lock go on for? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Five, ten minutes probably, thereabouts. I never took particular notice of the time.” 
         
        
       
       
       That evidence was not the subject of complaint by the appellant, but it was succeeded by the following evidence, which was: 
        
        
         
         “Q. Apart from saying that Mr Clark wanted her out of the house, did she say anything else? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She just said that she was scared of him and later on, she mentioned to me later on: ‘If anything ever happens to me just mention it to the police.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mention what to the police? 
         
        
        
         
         A. If she disappeared or anything happened to her just to report it to the police because she was scared of him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she tell you what to report to the police? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just that she went missing. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What were you to report to the police in that circumstance? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Just if she had gone missing, if she had gone missing, or if something strange happens just to report it to the police because it would be something to do with Nobby.” 
         
        
       
     83 Mrs Williams said that the morning after the telephone conversation which the deceased had had with her husband, which she thought was closer to the end of January than to the beginning, the deceased telephoned her. The following evidence was given, inadmissibly in the appellant’s submission: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. What did she say in relation to Mr Clark? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Do you want the words? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. She said: ‘That bastard’s going to kill me. What do I do?’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Speak up loudly and slow down? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Okay. She said: ‘That bastard’s going to kill me’, and she was very frightened. I told her to go to the police. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you say she was very frightened, is that what she told you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Or is that an impression you got? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Another thing she said was: ‘I’m shit scared of him.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did she say anything to you in relation to where she was living? 
         
        
        
         
         A. She had told me previous to that that she was having problems living there and she was hoping to move out she said at that stage with Casso but they hadn’t as yet moved, she hadn’t as yet moved, and Steven was giving her a hard time being there.” 
         
        
       
       
       She then gave evidence of an occasion in January 1999 when her own mother and Mrs Heil were both in hospital in Deniliquin, and she spoke to the deceased about visiting Mrs Heil. The following evidence was given, inadmissibly according to the appellant: 
        
        
         
         “Q. When you spoke with her about visiting Mrs Heil what did she say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I said: ‘I’m going up to see Mum, do you want to come up and see Nolene?’ She said: ‘If I go up there and Nobby finds out he’s going to kill me’.” 
         
        
       
     84 Finally, Mrs Wilson gave evidence that she encountered the deceased in the Middle Hotel on the evening of Friday 5 February 1999 at about 10 pm. 
      
       
        
         
         “A. She said: ‘Chooky, I’m frightened’ and I said: ‘What do you mean, Lyn?’ She said: ‘That B’s out to kill me’ and I said: ‘What do you mean by that?’ She said: ‘You know, he’s out to get me’ and I said: ‘Well, where is Casso?’ She said: ‘He’s giving me such such a hard time too’ and she followed me out the door. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Stopping you there, when she said ‘that B’s out to kill me’ would you be able to tell us what she actually said? If there was a swear word you can tell us that swear word? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Beg yours? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. If there is a swear word you are able to tell us that word? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Am I? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         A. She just stated – she was agitated and I would say she seemed quite intoxicated and she just said: ‘That bastard’s out to get me’ and I said: ‘What do you mean, Lyn?’ She said: ‘I am frightened, chooky, he’s out to get me.’ I said: ‘What about Casso, where’s he?’ She said: ‘He’s giving me the fucking shits too.’ 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When she said: ‘He’s out to get me, that bastard’ or whatever the words were, did she tell you whom she was referring to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, yeah, Nobby. I said: ‘Who do you mean?’ She said: ‘Nobby’.” 
         
        
       
       
       The references to “Casso” were references to Mr Robertson, with whom the deceased had had a sexual relationship, and with whom she was planning to live in rented accommodation from 8 February 1999.  
        
        
       The authorities relied on by the appellant 
       
     85 The first submission which the appellant advanced to this Court was put thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence was not direct evidence as was the case in the Wilson case (Wilson v The Queen) 1970 123 CLR 334) where the evidence of relationship was permitted but where the evidence consisted of a statement by the deceased to the accused and overheard by others to the effect that he threatened to kill her and why did he not get it over and done with. In that sense they were clearly statements of the deceased’s state of mind at the time but that state of mind as it existed whether it be correct or incorrect was expressed to the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Wilson was followed by Ratten 1972 AC 378 and later in 1989 by Walton (1989) 166 CLR 283 which in short could be said to be authorities for the proposition that the state of mind or belief can be received in evidence if such state of mind or belief is relevant. The state of mind of the deceased in this case is not relevant nor is it submitted is it evidence that would have been permitted to have been given by the deceased if the Appellant had been charged with for example a serious assault and that the deceased was available to give evidence. The evidence here is of course further removed from that factual matrix in that the evidence that was permitted was of an independent person, or third person, being told by the deceased certain things which were then repeated by that person in evidence their context and reliability can never be tested.” 
         
        
       
     86 The appellant also relied on R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 for the proposition that statements by one party to a relationship about her state of mind which were not in the presence of or communicated to the other were inadmissible.  
      
       
     87 It is convenient to consider what was said in the authorities referred to by the appellant. 
      
       
     88 In Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 336-337 Barwick CJ summarised the facts thus: 
      
       
        
         
         “The applicant’s wife died of gunshot wounds received by her whilst she was driving a tractor drawing a load of hay during the hours of day on a property in Victoria which the applicant was managing. The applicant had borrowed a shotgun from a neighbour, as he claimed in his evidence, for the purpose of shooting rabbits. On the day of his wife’s death he had placed the rifle on the top of the load of hay. He claimed that he had set the safety catch on the gun by pushing it forward. In fact this action released the safety catch: but the applicant denied that he knew this. He claimed that he had not discharged the gun but that it had discharged accidentally, perhaps when a dog had jumped upon the load of hay. There were no eye witnesses present. The contest at the trial was as to whether the applicant, admittedly present at the time, had shot his wife in the back of the head or whether the gun placed on the load of hay had accidentally discharged at a time when it was pointing towards the back of her head, the jury having of course to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had discharged the gun before they could convict.” 
         
        
       
     89 Barwick CJ then said (at 337-340): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is quite apparent that the nature of the current relationship between the applicant and his wife was relevant to the question to be decided by the jury. Evidence of a close affectionate relationship could properly have been used by the jury to incline against the conclusion, which might otherwise have been drawn from the circumstances, that the applicant killed his wife. Equally, evidence that there had developed mutual enmity could be used to induce the conclusion that he had killed his wife and that his story of an accidental shooting lacked credibility. 
         
        
        
         
         It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that evidence of the relationship of the parties was only admissible in so far as it furnished evidence of a motive which the applicant might possibly have had to have killed his wife. In support of this limited admissibility of such evidence, reference was made to R v Munn [[1930] NZLR 1017 at 1029]; Reg v Tsingopoulos [[1964] VR 676; R v Barbour [[1939] 1 DLR 65].  
         
        
        
         
         Before making a brief reference to these cases, I should observe that we are not concerned here with the reception of evidence of prior acts in order to establish systematic conduct or to negative accident, a matter with which the court was dealing in R v Bond [[1906] 2 KB 389]. None the less the sentence in the judgment of Kennedy J in that case from which I now quote whether or not so intended, is, as a statement of relevance, in my opinion, of universal validity and is not limited to any particular aspect of the relationship of which his Lordship spoke. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.’ [[1906] 2 KB at 401] 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In this statement ‘the conduct of the accused’ of which the relationship of the parties may be explanatory will not necessarily be limited to the act charged, as in this case, the act of shooting, but will extend, in my opinion, to any act of the accused the proof of which is itself relevant to the question whether the accused in fact did the act charged. Here the question was whether the deceased fired the gun. If he did, no other question remained. The relations of the parties, in my opinion, may be relevant to that fact. In R v Barbour [[1939] 1 DLR 65 at 66] evidence of quarrels which were no more than ‘transient ebullitions of annoyance and anger on the part of the accused which immediately passed away and led to nothing’ and which did not proceed from hostility or enmity nor tended to show the existence of or to promote such feelings were ruled inadmissible. Sir Lyman Duff CJ said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘If you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the fact as well. But I think, with the greatest possible respect, it is rather important that the courts should not slip into a habit of admitting evidence which reasonably viewed cannot tend to prove motive or to explain the acts charged merely because it discloses some incident in the history of the relations of the parties.’ [[1939] 1 DLR at 67] 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         If the words ‘or to explain the acts charged’, which are to be found in the latter part of this quotation were inserted as they may well have been intended to be, after the word ‘motive’ in the earlier part of the statement, I would respectfully agree with what the learned Chief Justice said: but otherwise I am unable to accept the limitation on the admissibility of the evidence which the learned Chief Justice’s words if not so expanded would seem to imply. Here the question is not whether a motive or some particular intent can be found or assigned for or in connexion with a killing but of choosing between the competing views in point of fact of accidental discharge of the gun and its discharge by the act of the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         No doubt in the text books it is the inference of motive which is said to be open on evidence of bad feelings between the parties or of the terms on which they have lived. See Hale, Pleas of the Crown, vol 1, p 451, Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed, vol 14, par 491, Phipson on Evidence p 151. But it is clear that such evidence may also provide material on which the fact of the killing may be inferred. See for example per Lord Atkinson in R v Ball [[1911] AC 47 at 68]; per Sir Lyman Duff [[1939] 1 DLR at 67]. It is not in my opinion only in those cases where the evidence of the relations of the accused with others tends to establish motive that it is admissible though that may be the commonest case of its use and the one with which the reported cases have had mostly to deal. If the evidence does tend to explain the occurrence, or, as in this case, to assist the choice between the two explanations of the occurrence, then in my opinion on general principles, because it is relevant, it is admissible. Of course if it does not have that relevance it is inadmissible. Of that kind was the evidence in R v Barbour [[1939] 1 DLR 65]. It is not that all evidence of the relationship of the parties is admissible, but only that from which a relevant inference may logically and reasonably be drawn. Here, there is no question of the remoteness in point of time of the occasions of which evidence of quarrelling was tendered and the time of the act charged, as was the case in Reg v Tsingopoulos [[1964] VR 676]. Here the evidence was of quarrelling and bad relationship over a considerable period stretching up to the time of the death of the deceased. In my opinion, the evidence of the relations which had developed between the applicant and his wife was admissible. 
         
        
        
         
         But it was also objected that, whilst evidence of statements of the applicant indicating his attitude to the deceased and statements of the deceased which could be regarded as likely to create animosity in the appellant towards her would have been admissible, evidence of statements by the deceased as to what she considered the appellant’s attitude to her to have been were inadmissible. It may at once be conceded that, if the statement attributed to the deceased had not been part of the evidence of a quarrel of a significant kind, the statement of her opinion of the applicant’s attitude or intention towards her would have been inadmissible. cf Reg v Bedingfield [(1879) 14 Cox CC 341]. But in this case the evidence of the statement was part of the evidence of a quarrel between the parties and, indeed, the words spoken in the course of that quarrel were indicative of the nature of the quarrel and of the levels which the mutual relationship of the parties had reached. It is impossible, in my opinion, to maintain the proposition that though the fact of quarrelling may be admissible, the primary evidence of the quarrelling, namely the words and gestures passing between the parties in the course of the quarrel, may not. Of course, care must be taken by appropriate directions to the jury to properly confine their use of such statements. Here the trial judge took adequate precautions in that behalf. In my opinion, the evidence of what the deceased said in the course of these quarrels between herself and the applicant was admissible. 
         
        
        
         
         Then it is submitted that the evidentiary value of the evidence to which I have referred was relatively small and that the judge ought to have exercised his discretion to exclude the evidence because of the highly prejudicial effect that evidence of such statements by the deceased could have in the minds of the jury. It is quite true that the Crown had upon the other evidence it produced at the trial a strong case. But though there was a strong case, and evidence of other quarrels in which the statements to which objection is taken were part of the evidence of the continuity of the quarrelling and of the depths to which the relationship of the parties, as husband and wife, had sunk. Of course, the deceased’s statements were most damaging to the applicant but they were not merely prejudicial. There was no reason, in my opinion, to deny the prosecutor the benefit of the evidence. In my opinion, neither of the statements ought to have been excluded in the exercise of a judicial discretion.” 
         
        
       
     90 Menzies J (with whom McTiernan J and Walsh J agreed) said at 343-345: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was contended by counsel for the applicant that the evidence of what the wife said on these two occasions was not admissible because her words could not be regarded as providing a basis for a homicidal response by the applicant or as giving the applicant some motive for killing his wife. The contention that the evidence was admissible only if the words could reasonably be regarded as causally related to the wife’s death in one or other of the ways stated was based upon a passage in the judgment of Kennedy J in R v Bond [[1906] 2 KB at 400-401], which followed a statement relating to the admissibility of evidence of prior criminal acts to prove the crime charged, and was as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘Such prior acts formed, in point of historical and circumstantial connexion, inseparable parts of the transaction which the jury had to investigate. Within this same limitation, I think, come the cases of trials for murder and wounding with felonious intent, in which evidence is admissible to shew prior assaults by the prisoner upon the murdered or injured person or menaces uttered to him by the prisoner, or to shew conversely irritating behaviour by the deceased to the prisoner, as in Reg v Hagan [(1873) 12 Cox CC 357]. The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion this statement affords no justification for the limitation for which counsel for the applicant has contended. The essential parts of his Lordship’s statement is to be found in the words: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘The relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial. [[1906] 2 KB at 401] 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         These words are fatal to the contention of counsel for the applicant and are not to be read down by the words which precede them. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to me that here, as so often happens, an attempt has been made to reduce the law of evidence – which rests fundamentally upon the requirement of relevancy, i.e. having a bearing upon the matter in issue – to a set of artificial rules remote from reality and unsupported by reason. Any jury called upon to decide whether they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant killed his wife would require to know what was the relationship between the deceased and the accused. Were they an ordinary married couple with a good relationship despite differences and disagreements, or was their relationship one of enmity and distrust? It seems to me that nothing spoke more eloquently of the bitter relationship between them than that the wife, in the course of a quarrel, should charge her husband with the desire to kill her. The evidence is admissible not because the wife’s statements were causally connected with her death but to assist the jury in deciding whether the wife was murdered in cold blood or was the victim of mischance. To shut the jury off from any event throwing light upon the relationship between this husband and wife would be to require them to decide the issue as if it happened in a vacuum rather than in the setting of a tense and bitter relationship between a man and a woman who were husband and wife. Accordingly, in my opinion the evidence in question was properly admitted because it was pertinent to the issues which the jury had to decide. 
         
        
        
         
         The next submission that there had been a mistrial rests upon what was put as a wrong exercise by the learned presiding judge in failing to exclude the foregoing statements of the wife on the ground that their prejudicial effect was out of all proportion to their probative value. In the light of the other evidence I have found no reason to think his Honour was in error in admitting what, for the purpose of this argument, is conceded to be admissible evidence. His Honour carefully directed the jury upon the use that they could make of the evidence and warned them against treating the statements as evidence of the actual state of mind of the applicant.” 
         
        
       
     91 R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 was a case in which the accused was convicted of murdering his de facto wife. There was evidence the admissibility of which was not challenged that there had been numerous arguments between the accused and the victim and that he had told a witness, Mrs Jeacle, that he hated the victim, and that he had decided to leave her. Gleeson CJ said that this evidence was “admissible because the nature of the relationship between the appellant and his wife was relevant” (at 218). He also said that the admissibility of evidence from Miss Mulqueen that she had heard loud quarrelling between the accused and the victim was not in issue. However, the reception of other evidence was complained about. Gleeson CJ said at 220-1: 
      
       
        
         
         “The challenged evidence was given by the deceased’s daughter, Lisa Mulqueen. It took two forms. 
         
        
        
         
         First, Lisa Mulqueen said that, shortly after her mother’s death, whilst cleaning the house at Umina, she found amongst her mother’s personal effects a document in the nature of a diary note, in her mother’s handwriting. The document was tendered in evidence. It is headed: ‘Reasons for Ending Relationship with M’. The document listed, in some detail, what were regarded by the deceased as serious personal deficiencies on the part of the appellant. He was said to have acted cruelly towards the [deceased’s] dog, to have been extremely jealous of the [deceased’s] relationship with others, including males, to be uncivilised if guests came to the house, and to be a drain upon the deceased’s finances. More significantly, the document recorded that the appellant was ‘definitely unbalanced when drinking’ that he was a ‘potential threat’ to the deceased, that he had a ‘nasty side to him when drinking’ that he engaged in ‘crazy behaviour’ and that he had a ‘crazy look in his eyes’. 
         
        
        
         
         Lisa Mulqueen also gave evidence of a number of conversations, including telephone conversations, she had with her mother. In the course of those telephone conversations, the deceased made allegations of misconduct and violence on the part of the appellant. The appellant was said to have accused the deceased of being unfai",2001-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      Headnote 
     The circumstancesIn February 1989 the first appellant and the respondent solicitor entered into a joint venture to run IGC, a company established by them, and to share the profits of both IGC and the respondent’s legal practice. IGC was viable in the first three years but began to decline in early 1993, and ultimately collapsed. The first appellant claimed that, in negotiations preceding entry into the joint venture, the respondent had misrepresented the true value of his practice, and that in drawing up the joint venture agreement the respondent had failed to properly document certain terms. On entering the joint venture, the first appellant ceased working as the managing director of his former employer’s company, and in mid-1989, he mortgaged his house (the “Leeton Avenue property”) to provide security for debts of the joint venture business. In 1993, this mortgage was refinanced and new mortgages were given over the property.During the course of the joint venture, the respondent acted as the appellants’ solicitor. In about mid-1989, the appellants requested the respondent to arrange for the transfer of the Leeton Avenue property from the first appellant to the first appellant and second appellant as joint tenants. The respondent did not register the transfer.The course of the proceedingsIn June 1996 the appellants filed a statement of claim. On behalf of the first appellant, it alleged breaches by the respondent of his duties as solicitor and also breaches of his fiduciary duties as joint venturer. Damage, including loss of salary, moneys payable on the collapse of IGC, and consequent psychological injuries, was claimed in respect of all the breaches of duty. On behalf of the second appellant, the statement of claim alleged failure by the respondent to carry through the transfer of the Leeton Avenue property, with loss of the value of the house, and consequent psychological injury claimed as damage.The hearing ran for 6 days, concluding on 1st March 2000. During the proceedings an application for an amendment to raise a defence under the Limitation Act was made but not decided. The primary judge gave his decision on 18th December 2000, finding that the respondent had breached his duties as solicitor and joint venturer. He did not rule on the Limitation Act defence, but requested further submissions from the appellants inter alia on whether the amendment should be allowed, how the Limitation Act affected the personal injury claim, and how the damage might be divided up between the various breaches. Submissions were received but added little to what had already been put, and on 27th April 2001, the judge held that the appellants’ claims were statute-barred.Held, allowing the appeal:1. There was lack of procedural fairness necessitating a new trial. 
      
      a) The question of when the first appellant relevantly first suffered damage was a mixed question of fact and law which was not addressed in the reasons of the primary judge.  
       
      b) [Obiter] The primary judge failed to rule early enough on whether an amendment to include the Limitation Act defence should be permitted.  
       
      c) [Obiter] The judgment of 18th December 2001 contained no findings as to what damage was suffered, or what damage, if any, was caused by what breaches of duty. The opportunities offered to the appellants to make further submissions on these matters came too late. 
       
     2. The Court was not satisfied that the primary judge’s conclusion on the first appellant’s limitation defence was correct.  
      
      a) It was not clearly shown that any damage occurred at the time of entry into the joint venture. Neither the giving up of secure employment, the lack of proper documentation of the joint venture, the lack of backing of a substantial legal practice, nor the mortgaging of the house, of itself constituted damage. In circumstances where no actual loss of money or property had been shown, to prove that damage was relevantly suffered before mid-1990, a global comparison was required. If it had been shown that the true value of what the first appellant obtained in early 1989, assessed at that time, was less than the true value of what the first appellant gave up, assessed at that time, then this would have been such a loss.  
       
      b) [Obiter] Subject to s.60G of the Limitation Act, the claim for psychological injury would be barred if the claim for commercial loss was barred, because the personal injury itself was alleged to have been occasioned through the commercial loss. However, an action claiming personal injuries occasioned by commercial loss, if otherwise maintainable, might fall within s.60G as a cause of action founded on breach of duty from damages for personal injury.  
       
      c) [Obiter] The primary judge was correct in not considering whether there were any particular causes of action arising after mid-1990 in circumstances where no claim on that basis had been formulated with any clarity by the first appellant 
      . 
       
        
       
     3. The second appellant’s claim in effect alleged a continuing breach and was thereby not statute-barred.  
      
      The gravamen of second appellant’s complaint was that, not only was there no attempt to remove the original mortgage from her half-interest, but also that her half- interest was further burdened by later transactions and mortgages.  
     4. It was not possible for the Court to say that the material before the primary judge could not justify appropriate findings of breaches of duty of the type alleged in the Statement of Claim.

      CASSIS & ANOR. V. KALFUS 
       
      Judgment 
     1 POWELL JA: I have read in draft the Judgment which has been prepared by Hodgson JA. 
      
       
     2 Since I am of the view that, in the light of the events recounted by his Honour, the trial is to be regarded as having miscarried, I agree with the orders which he has proposed for the disposition of the appeal. 
      
       
     3 Had it not been for the comments made by Hodgson JA in paragraph 81 of his Judgment as to the decision in Williams v. The Minister and as to the view expressed by Deane J in Hawkins v. Clayton, I would not have considered that anything further was called for on my part. However, in the light of those comments and of the likelihood that those questions will, or may, need to be considered on any rehearing, I think it desirable to make the following observations. 
      
       
     4 I take Hodgson JA’s reference to the decision in Williams v. The Minister as intended to be a reference to the following part of the Judgment of Kirby P in that case: 
      
       
        
         
         The structure of the Limitation Act 1969 makes it clear that the ancient principles of Equity have been preserved. Unlike certain Provinces of Canada, and other jurisdictions, the equitable claims are not as such, subject to the direct application of the limitation statute. Thus, s 23 of the Limitation Act provides: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Sections 14 … do not apply, except so far as they may be applied by analogy, to a cause of action for specific performance of a contract or for an injunction  
           for other equitable relief 
           . (Emphasis added.) 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Section 14 is the general provision in the Limitation Act which relevantly provides: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (1) An action on any of the following causes of action is not maintainable if brought after the expiration of a limitation period … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) A cause of action founded on tort, including a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty … 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is therefore clear that the scheme of the Limitation Act does not apply, in its own terms, to a cause of action for equitable relief. It only applies by analogy. It is in this way that the Act has preserved the practice of the Chancery courts: see Hovenden v. Lord Annesley (1806) 2 Sch & Lef 607 at 630; John Runyate, Limitation of Actions in Equity, London (1932) Stevens. This does not mean that an equitable cause of action pays no regard to gross delay. The terms of s. 23 of the Limitation Act would contradict such an assertion. Although historically, statutes of limitations did not apply to equitable claims, the courts of equity developed their own limitation defences, most importantly by the defence of laches: see Lindsay Petroleum Co v. Hurd (1874) LR 5 PC 221 at 239f; Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218. But it is a mistake of law to assume that an equitable claim, based on an equitable cause of action, not for damages but for equitable compensation, is to be dealt with under s.60G of the Limitation Act. It is not. It raises separate and different questions. Nor can the application of the Act ‘by analogy’ lead to the automatic application of s 60G to such a claim. Analogous application of the statute does not necessarily mean exact application of its terms. The considerations that may be relevant to a defence of laches will be different from (or not exactly the same as) the considerations relevant to the application of the Act. 
         
        
       
       
       and, in particular, to the second last sentence in that part, a sentence with which I do not agree. 
        
       
     5 This being so, I think it appropriate to include, here, the following passages from the speech of Lord Westbury in Knox v. Gye ((1871-1872) LR 5 HL 671-674): 
      
       
        
         
         Upon this bill the Plaintiff prays, with reference to this particular point, ‘That an account may be taken by and under the decree and direction’ of the Court, ‘of what is due and owing to the Plaintiff from the Defendant in respect of the Plaintiff’s share of the sum of £12,000 brought into and left in the concern by Mr. Thistlethwayte, as hereinbefore mentioned (including the whole of the judgment debt recovered, or which might, but for the wilful default of the Defendant, have been recovered from Hughes), and the interest thereof and the profits of the partnership; and that what shall appear on taking the same account to be due from the Defendant may be decreed to be paid by him to the Plaintiff.’ From this and from other portions of the bill it is clear that the account sought is an account of the estate of the partnership as it existed at the time of the dissolution, and of the property and receipts by Mr. Gye subsequent to the dissolution of the partnership. The bill is, therefore, in effect, an action by the Appellant, as executor of the deceased partner, against the surviving partner for an account of the share of the deceased partner in the partnership between him and the Respondent, which terminated by the death of Mr. Thistlethwayte, in December, 1854. An action might have been brought for this account by the Appellant against the Respondent at Common Law, but in a case like the present a Court of Equity assumes and exercises concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts of Law, and this bill is brought by virtue of such concurrent jurisdiction. 
         
        
        
         
         By the Statute of Limitations (21 Jac. 1, c.16), it is enacted that all actions of account and upon the case (with an exception which has been since repealed) shall be commenced and sued within six years next after the cause of such action or suit, and not after. This enactment is, in effect, repeated in the 9th section of the 19 & 20 Vict. c.97 (passed in 1856), with this additional provision, namely, that ‘no claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of such action or suit shall be enforceable by action or suit by reason only of some other matter or claim comprised in the same account having arisen within six years next before the commencement of such action or suit’. I deem this provision most material, and therefore I will call your Lordships’ particular attention to it. It forbids any claim in respect of a matter which arose more than six years before the action. 
         
        
        
         
         In the case that we are considering, the matter, namely, the dissolution of the partnership, and, consequently, the possession of the partnership property by the surviving partner, did arise more than six years before the commencement of this suit. The provision forbids that any action of account the cause of which arose more than six years before suit shall be considered as liable to be sued upon after such six years ‘by reason only of some other matter or claim comprised in the same account having arisen within six years next before the commencement of such action or suit.’ The Appellant here relies upon the claim against Hughes having been received and realized within six years before the commencement of such action or suit. The question is, was that claim against Hughes, that debt due to the partnership; a thing comprised in the same account? An account of the partnership estate would unquestionably comprise that claim, and the statute was directed, as we all know, against the erroneous notion that an account which had been barred by the lapse of six years after the last entry in the account might be considered as opened and revived by the receipt of a subsequent sum of money more than six years after the date of the last entry. It removes that notion, provided the receipt after the six years is the receipt of an item comprised in the original account. The word ‘comprised’ I construe as equivalent to ‘that would have been comprehended’ in; that is, that would have been an item in the account demanded. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         That a Court of Equity will not, after the lapse of six years without acknowledgment, decree an account between a surviving partner and the estate of a deceased partner has been long settled by various decisions. The rule, of course, must be the same where the parties are reversed, and the representative of the deceased partner is the Plaintiff. The general principle was laid down as early as the case of  
         Lockey v. Lockey 
         , where it was held that where a Court of Equity assumes a concurrent jurisdiction with Courts of Law no account will be given after the legal limit of six years, if the statute be pleaded. If it could be doubted whether the executor of a deceased partner can, at Common Law, have an action of account against the surviving partner, the result will still be the same, because a Court of Equity, in affording such a remedy and giving such an account, would act by analogy to the Statute of Limitations. For where the remedy in Equity is correspondent to the remedy at Law, and the latter is subject to a limit in point of time by the Statute of Limitations, a Court of Equity acts by analogy to the statute, and imposes on the remedy it affords the same limitation. This is the meaning of the common phrase, that a Court of Equity acts by analogy to the Statute of Limitations, the meaning being, that where the suit in Equity corresponds with an action at Law which is included in the orders of the statute, a Court of Equity adopts the enactment of the statute as its own rule of procedure. But if any proceeding in Equity be included within the words of the statute, there a Court of Equity, like a Court of Law, acts in obedience to the statute. I have no doubt, therefore, of the Statute of Limitations being a bar to the whole of the relief sought by the Appellant as executor of Thistlethwayte. 
         
        
        
         
         Your Lordships will no doubt recollect that in the observations I have made with regard to the adoption of the statute by a Court of Equity, I refer to those well-known expressions of Lord Redesdale, in which he distinguishes between the cases where a Court of Equity acts in analogy to the statute, and where it acts in obedience to the statute. Where a Court of Equity frames its remedy upon the basis of the Common Law, and supplements the Common Law by extending the remedy to parties who cannot have an action at Common Law, there the Court of Equity acts in analogy to the statute; that is, it adopts the statute as the rule of procedure regulating the remedy it affords. 
         
        
       
     6 To these passages might be added a reference to the following passages in the Judgment of Dixon J (as he then was) in Cohen v. Cohen: 
      
       
        
         
         There remains the question whether the plaintiff is precluded by lapse of time from recovering in respect of (i.) the German marks collected by the defendant from Halle, (ii.) the proceeds of the sale of her furniture (£123) and (iii.) the £80 unaccounted for out of £120 paid to him by the insurer of her pearls. 
         
        
        
         
         I assume that in some way the law which in England results from 21 Jac. I. C. 16, Lord Tenterden’s Act (9 Geo. IV. C. 14) and sec. 9 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (19 & 20 Vic. c. 97) is in force in relation to an action heard in this Court. If it had not been for the doubts expressed in  
         Lady Carrington Steamship Co. v. Commonwealth 
         , I should have supposed that secs. 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903-1927 operated in such a way that a suit in this Court heard in Victoria was affected by secs. 79 and 85 of the Victorian Supreme Court At 1915, which enacts this law for Victoria, as well as by sec. 57(2) of the same Act (see per Isaacs J. in  
         Federated Sawmill &c. Association v. Alexander) 
         . Upon the assumption made the first question which arises is whether these three causes of action are of such a nature that they may be barred directly by, or else by analogy to, these provisions. In at least two of these three instances the defendant was accountable in equity for what he had received on the plaintiff’s behalf. The Statute of Limitations, by its terms, does not operate directly upon equitable remedies. (see also, for Victoria, sec. 79(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1915.) But such remedies are barred in Courts of equity by analogy to the statute. The analogy is found in the case of constructive trusts, where the equity is fastened upon the trustee not because he intended to become the fiduciary of property but because of the character of his dealings and in spite of his intention to take the property for himself. But Courts of equity have refused to see any analogy when a person, intending to act in a capacity which is fiduciary, has received, as and for the beneficial property of another, something which he is to hold, apply or account for specifically for his benefit. Such a person is either an express trustee, or, if that name does not in strictness belong to him, he stands in the same position as a direct or express trustee (see  
         Soar v. Ashwell 
         ). In  
         Burdick v. Garrick 
          attorneys under power who were authorised to sell the principal’s property and invest the proceeds set up the statute in vain. Giffard L.J. said: - ‘There was a very special power of attorney, under which the agents were authorized to receive and invest, to buy real estate, and otherwise to deal with the property; but under no circumstances could the money be called theirs; under no circumstances had they the least right to apply the money to their own use, or to keep it otherwise than to a distinct and separate account; throughout the whole of the time that this agency lasted the money was the money of’ the principal ‘ and not in any sense theirs. Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation in saying that there was, in the plainest possible terms, a direct trust created … . I do not hesitate to say that where the duty of persons is to receive property, and to hold it for another, and to keep it until it is called for, they cannot discharge themselves from that trust by appealing to the lapse of time.’ The last sentence is often quoted, and in  
         Lyell v. Kennedy 
          Lord Macnaghten said he thought it was a sound proposition. ‘I do not think,’ he continued, ‘it can make any difference what the nature of the property may be, whether it is a lump sum, or collected in the shape of rents accruing from time to time … Nor do I think it can make any difference whether the duty arises from contract or is connected with some previous request, or whether it is self-imposed and undertaken without any authority whatever. If it be established that the duty has in fact been undertaken and that property has been received by a person assuming to act in a fiduciary character, the same consequences must, I think, in every case follow.’ In  
         Henry v. Hammond 
          Channell J., after referring to these authorities, says: - ‘We must apply that principle to a case where the property is a sum of money. It is clear that if the terms upon which the person receives the money are that he is bound to keep it separate, either in a bank or elsewhere, and to hand that money so dept as a separate fund to the person entitled to it, then he is a trustee of that money and must hand it over to the person who is his cestui que trust. If, on the other hand, he is not bound to keep the money separate, but is entitled to mix it with his own money with it as he pleases, and when called upon to hand over an equivalent sum of money, then, in my opinion, he is not a trustee .. but a mere debtor. All the authorities seem to me to be consistent with that statement of the law.’ The application of these principles to the three causes of action now in question appears to depend upon making the correct inferences of fact. 
         
        
       
     7 I take Hodgson JA’s reference to “the view expressed by Deane J’ in Hawkins v. Clayton to be a reference to the following passage: 
      
       
        
         
         It is however, unnecessary to pursue these problems involved in the firm’s defence based on the Limitation Act. There is a more general answer to that defence. Its basis is to be found in the circumstance that, in the present case, the negligent failure of the firm to inform Mr. Hawkins of the existence and contents of the testatrix’s last will not only caused the damage which was sustained by him in the capacity of executor of the testatrix’s estate but also effectively concealed from him for so long as he remained unaware of the contents of the will, the existence of the cause of action in negligence against the firm. 
         
        
       
       
       and to the passage which follows it. 
        
       
     8 The status to be accorded to the exception to the general rule as to the commencement of limitation periods suggested by Deane J in these passages, is, to say the least, unclear, if only because although in Hawkins v. Clayton each of Brennan J and Gaudron J concurred in the order proposed by his Honour, neither agreed with the basis upon which his Honour founded his Judgment, and each of them proceeded upon the basis that no cause of action accrued to Mr. Hawkins until he assumed the office of executor. 
      
       
     9 HEYDON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA. On the understanding that nothing in his reasons for those orders is to bind the trial judge at the second trial in relation to any matter of fact or law relevant to the rights of the parties arising out of the allegations in the pleadings, I agree with the reasons advanced by Hodgson JA for those orders, except for those stated in the second-sixth sentences of [81]. The proposition there attributed to Williams v Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (1994) 35 NSWLR 497 is supported by Kirby P, but it is far from clear that it is supported by Priestley JA in view of the tentative and cautious mode in which he expressed the basis of his concurrence with the orders proposed by Kirby P. It was not supported by Powell JA. 
      
       
     10 HODGSON JA: On 18th December 2000, Dowd J delivered a judgment in proceedings brought by the appellants Sami and Gisele Cassis against the respondent Marcel Kalfus. At that stage, his Honour made no orders apart from granting liberty to the parties to approach his Associate to re-list the matter for resolution of various issues.  
      
       
     11 On 27th April 2001, Dowd J delivered a further judgment, and made orders granting leave to the respondent to file and serve a Defence to the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim, including a defence under the Limitation Act 1969, and granting leave to the appellants to particularise such claims and damages following therefrom as were not barred by that Act. His Honour reserved costs.  
      
       
     12 On 17th May 2001, the appellants filed a Notice of Appeal from the two judgments to which I have referred, and on 29th May 2001, the respondent filed a Notice of Motion to strike out that appeal.  
      
       
     13 On 22nd June 2001, Dowd J delivered a further judgment, and gave judgment in favour of the respondent on the appellants’ claim, and ordered the appellants to pay the respondent’s costs of the proceedings.  
      
       
     14 On 5th July 2001, the appellants filed an Amended Notice of Appeal, seeking orders setting aside the judgment of 27th April 2001 and the orders of 22nd June 2001, and seeking judgment for the appellants with damages to be assessed. We are now dealing with that Amended Notice of Appeal.  
      
       
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
     15 The first appellant was born in Egypt on 15th October 1936. He married the second appellant in 1967, and they moved to France in 1969. Between 1970 and 1981, the first appellant worked as a scientist or engineer in France for Chaffoteaux et Maury (C&M), at that time the world’s largest manufacturer of instant gas hot water heaters. 
      
       
     16 The appellants migrated to Australia in 1981, and in 1982 the first appellant began doing work for C&M in Australia. The first appellant located the respondent in the Yellow Pages, and engaged him as a solicitor to undertake legal work to establish an Australian subsidiary of C&M, called Chaffoteaux et Maury (Australia) Pty. Limited (CMA). The first appellant became the managing director of CMA, and the respondent subsequently acted in various matters as solicitor for the first appellant and for CMA, and was also an alternate director of CMA.  
      
       
     17 The business of CMA expanded, and its turnover increased from $425,824.00 in 1983 to $1,986,985.00 in 1988, by which time the first appellant was on a salary package of about $100,000.00 per annum.  
      
       
     18 In 1984, the respondent acted for the appellants on the purchase of an apartment at 69 Coogee Bay Road, Coogee. This apartment was sold in 1986, and in that year the respondent acted on the instructions of the first appellant in the purchase of a house at 3 Leeton Avenue, Coogee in the first appellant’s name. This purchase was financed in part by a loan from the Advance Bank, secured by mortgage over the property.  
      
       
     19 In 1988, it was agreed between the first appellant and the respondent that they would enter negotiations with C&M to acquire the business of CMA. In November 1988, the respondent established a company International Gas Corporation Pty. Limited (IGC) to carry on that business, and the first appellant and the respondent became directors and shareholders of that company.  
      
       
     20 On 23rd January 1989, the respondent executed a document on the letterhead of his legal practice, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         Re: Legal Practice of MARCEL KALFUS & CO 
          
         This letter is by way of confirmation of the agreements reached between ourselves concerning International Gas Corporation Pty Limited and the above legal practice. 
          
          
         I hereby confirm and acknowledge that you shall from 1st February, 1989, be entitled to an one half share of the net profits of the above legal practice. In determining net profits there shall be deducted from the gross fees received in any tax year or trading period, all operating expenses including wages, rent, equipment leasing charges and bank interest and other charges and income tax. 
          
          
         I hereby further confirm that the net profit from the legal practice and from International Gas Corporation Pty Limited (IGC) and all other related companies or businesses operated by us jointly, are to be pooled or aggregated and then shared by us on an equal basis. 
          
          
         I also confirm that you shall be entitled during an annual period of operation of IGC and related entities to draw the sum of $100,000 as an annual salary as managing director of the company. 
          
          
         Similarly, I shall be entitled to draw the sum of $100,000 as from the gross fees received by Marcel Kalfus & Co on account of my share of such profits.  
          
          
         Our respective advance drawings against profits may exceed the sum of $100,000 but in the absence of express agreement between ourselves the same shall not in any year exceed the total of the permissible advance on drawings by 25% ie in the first year such advance drawings must not exceed $125,000. We may by agreement, at any time vary the amount of advance drawings in any year. All amounts paid by way of advance drawings shall be debited to the account of share of profits of yourself and myself respectively. If the amount of advance drawings of either of us in any accounting period exceeds a half share of the net profit of IGC (and its related entities) and the legal practice, then such excess will be debited against such person's account for share of profits in the ensuing year. 
          
          
         I trust this letter provides you with the comfort you desire concerning our new and exciting venture. 
         
        
       
     21 On 27th February 1989, there was a handwritten agreement made between C&M on the one hand and the first appellant and the respondent on the other, whereby C&M agreed to sell its shares in CMA to the first appellant and the respondent for a little over $A1 million, subject to adjustments. This amount was to be paid over a two year period. Subsequently, IGC entered into a distribution agreement with C&M for a period of two years.  
      
       
     22 It appears that IGC commenced trading in about March 1989. In order to raise working capital, it arranged for an overdraft facility of $200,000.00 with Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP). The first appellant and the respondent were guarantors of that facility, and their obligations were secured by mortgages. In the case of the first appellant, this was a mortgage dated 6th July 1989 over the Leeton Avenue property, subsequent to the mortgage or mortgages to the Advance Bank. This mortgage was registered on 8th September 1989. In the case of the respondent, the security was a third mortgage over his house property at Double Bay.  
      
       
     23 In about mid-1989, the appellants requested the respondent to arrange for the transfer of the Leeton Avenue property to the first appellant and the second appellant as joint tenants, and a transfer to achieve this was signed and dated 7th August 1989. It appears that the respondent did not thereafter take any steps to have this transfer registered.  
      
       
     24 It appears that IGC traded satisfactorily for the first three years, and the debt to C&M incurred in association with the acquisition of the business was fully repaid within that time. It appears also that the first appellant drew a substantial salary, not dissimilar in the substantial benefit which he obtained from it from the salary package which he previously had with CMA.  
      
       
     25 It appears that in about late 1990, the respondent told the first appellant that he was having financial difficulty in his practice, and he sent the first appellant a letter from his bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, showing something over $350,000.00 owing to that bank.  
      
       
     26 On 12th February 1991, a shareholders deed was entered into between the first appellant, the respondent and IGC, conferring mutual rights of first refusal in relation to each of the shareholder’s shares in IGC.  
      
       
     27 In September 1991, the National Australia Bank (NAB) replaced BNP as IGC’s financier. At that time, it advanced $70,000.00 to pay out the loan from the Advance Bank secured on the Leeton Avenue property, and it also advanced $100,000.00 to pay out BNP and granted an overdraft facility for a further $150,000.00. NAB took a first mortgage over the Leeton Avenue property as security, and a third mortgage over the respondent’s Double Bay property. The respondent acted in these proceedings as solicitor for IGC and the first appellant.  
      
       
     28 At this time, it appears that the first appellant realised that he was more exposed to loss from this arrangement than the respondent, because of the lesser equity in the Double Bay property that went towards the NAB security, as compared with his equity in the Leeton Avenue property. At the first appellant’s request, on 24th September 1991, the respondent signed a letter addressed to the first appellant promising to indemnify him for fifty percent of any personal losses in respect of liability to the NAB.  
      
       
     29 In January 1992, C&M advised that it proposed to take away its agency from IGC, and on 9th April 1992, C&M gave notice that the “distribution contract” would terminate on 31st December 1992. 
      
       
     30 As a result of this termination, IGC’s business declined. It had cash problems in 1993.  
      
       
     31 On 12th December 1993, the respondent signed a letter addressed to the first appellant promising to indemnify the first appellant for fifty percent of his personal liability to third party creditors.  
      
       
     32 On 23rd December 1993, NAB was paid out from the proceeds of new mortgages granted over the Leeton Avenue property. There was a first mortgage in relation to $280,000.00 obtained through a solicitor Mr. White, and a second mortgage for $40,000.00 obtained through a mortgage broker Mr. Vesaro. The borrower in respect of both of these loans was the first appellant, not IGC or the respondent. The respondent provided no security, only a personal guarantee. He charged legal fees of about $6,000.00 to the first appellant for acting in these transactions.  
      
       
     33 IGC made the repayments under the mortgage, and by reason of this and the declining business of IGC, the first appellant was now receiving little remuneration. 
      
       
     34 In mid-1994, in order to obtain further capital for the business, agreements were made with one Robert Roden. A new company International Gas Appliances Pty. Ltd. (IGA) was formed to acquire the assets of IGC for about $45,000.00. $220,000.00 was advanced by Mr. Roden to IGA, and repayment was secured by a charge over the assets of IGA and guaranteed to the extent of fifty percent by the first appellant. Agreements to this effect were executed on 1st July 1994. The result of this was to leave IGC with no assets, but with liabilities in the order of $52,500.00. These were paid by the first appellant. In addition, the first appellant still had the liabilities under the White and Vesaro mortgages.  
      
       
     35 From July 1994 onwards, IGA suffered substantial trading losses, and on 6th April 1995, Mr. Roden gave notice requiring the first appellant to pay $106,250.00 pursuant to his guarantee. On 17th November 1995, Mr. Roden obtained judgment in the Supreme Court against the first appellant for this amount, plus interest and costs.  
      
       
     36 On 8th August 1994, the Vesaro mortgage was discharged from the $45,000.00 paid to IGC by IGA for the acquisition of its assets.  
      
       
     37 In March 1995, the Leeton Avenue property was sold to the appellant’s son, Rami Cassis, for $450,000.00. At settlement, about $288,000.00 was paid to discharge the White mortgage. The respondent acted as a solicitor on this transaction and was paid legal fees. The first appellant assigned to the second appellant his entitlement to the balance of the purchase money, with the result that the second appellant became entitled to about $162,000.00. After the sale, the appellants continued to reside at the property.  
      
       
        
       THE COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
       
     38 These proceedings were commenced by Statement of Claim on 12th June 1996. Prior to the hearing, there were two amendments made to the Statement of Claim, the third version being filed on or about 3rd September 1999.  
      
       
     39 The hearing before Dowd J commenced on 21st February 2000. The case as opened for the appellants apparently diverged somewhat from the Third Statement of Claim, and the appellants were directed to file a Fourth Amended Statement of Claim. This was in fact filed in Court on 24th February 2000.  
      
       
     40 This Statement of Claim alleged first, on behalf of the first appellant, breaches of duties by the respondent as the first appellant’s solicitor over the period 1988 to 1995, and also breaches of fiduciary duties owed by the first appellant to the respondent as a joint venturer over the same period. The Statement of Claim then claimed damages for all these breaches of duty, comprising principally the loss of salary from 1st July 1993 to 15th October 2001 amounting to about $450,000.00, moneys payable on the collapse of IGC amounting to something over half a million dollars, and damages for consequent psychological injuries. On behalf of the second appellant, the Statement of Claim alleged failure by the respondent to carry through the transfer to her of her half interest in the Leeton Avenue property, resulting in the loss of the property valued at $450,000.00; and also claimed damages for consequent psychological injuries. 
      
       
     41 On the second day of the hearing, 22nd February 2000, the respondent applied to add a defence under the Limitation Act 1969 and also a defence of laches. This application was opposed.  
      
       
     42 On 28th February 2000, the respondent sought leave to file an Amended Defence, including those additional grounds. Again this was objected to, although in the course of argument Senior Counsel for the appellants said that he “can’t say there is any prejudice”. The primary judge granted leave to file the Defence, but subject to the qualification that the allowance of the new defences under the Limitation Act and of laches would be subject to further argument and consideration.  
      
       
     43 On 1st March 2000, after a six day hearing concluding with oral submissions, the primary judge reserved his decision, making provision for further written submissions to be provided. There were written submissions from the appellant served on 6th March, submissions from the respondent served on 9th March, submissions in reply from the appellant served 13th March, and final submissions from the respondent served on 14th March. 
      
       
     44 The primary judge gave a judgment on 18th December 2000. This judgment summarised the appellants’ claims and the defence, and summarised the evidence that had been given in the case. It then went on to deal with issues for determination under the headings “The Existence of the Joint Venture”, “The First Plaintiff’s Claim Arising from the Solicitor/Client Relationship”, “The First Plaintiff’s Claim for Breach of Fiduciary Duty”, “Breach of the Legal Profession Act 1987”, and “Limitation Act 1969”.  
      
       
     45 On the first matter, the existence of the joint venture, the primary judge made the following finding: 
      
       
        
         
         I find that a joint venture agreement existed which was partly evidenced in writing, partly by conduct and partly by oral agreement between the first plaintiff and the defendant. 
         
        
       
     46 In relation to the second matter, the first plaintiff’s claim arising from the solicitor/client relationship, the primary judge made the following finding: 
      
       
        
         
         Although there is no evidence, it is clear that during the course of the joint venture, the defendant failed to advise the first plaintiff as to the risks in securing the debts over the premises at 3 Leeton Avenue, Coogee; that he failed to explain the need for a document establishing the joint venture, and the remedies which the first plaintiff might have against him in terms of the arrangement; that he failed to advise the first plaintiff that the defendant viewed the entering into of the sale of the IGC equipment and business as putting an end to his liability to contribute to the IGC loss and putting it into the defendant’s liabilities under the joint venture. 
          
          
         The ramifications of failing to explain the legal effects of the joint venture could well have resulted in the joint venture not proceeding in the form it took, although it may have proceeded on another basis.  
          
          
         The defence offered by the defendant that the first plaintiff made his own decision in relation to commercial matters is no answer to the defendant’s obligation to the first plaintiff as the solicitor acting in the various transactions for the first plaintiff. This is no defence. 
          
          
         I find the defendant breached his duty as solicitor to the plaintiff in each of the circumstances in paragraph 240 above [the first paragraph quoted]. 
         
        
       
     47 In relation to the third matter, the first plaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the primary judge made the following findings: 
      
       
        
         
         Notwithstanding the tendency of the first plaintiff to ‘tailor his evidence’ to suit his case and to constantly emphasise the points as suited to his case, I nonetheless accept his evidence that the defendant represented that he was in receipt of some $200,000 from his practice and that the practice was worth some $500,000. The defendant was an unimpressive witness. 
          
          
         The evidence to which the defendant eventually agreed was that he had represented at one point that his practice was worth $450,000. As a matter of common sense, it is hard to see that if he represented that he was making as little as he was in fact earning, that is something in the order of $70,000 before or after tax, that the first plaintiff would have been attracted to pool the income of the gas sales business and the solicitor’s practice. 
          
         … 
          
          
         The primary focus are a failure to reduce to written form the term of the joint venture agreement of which it disadvantaged the first plaintiff. The defendant induced the first plaintiff to enter into a financial arrangement from which the defendant stood to benefit without bearing a risk commensurate with that of the first plaintiff; he failed to disclose his true financial position to the first plaintiff and failed to contribute any funds to the joint venture despite promising to do so as admitted in his own evidence. 
          
          
         The defendant was also a party to the first plaintiff entering into financial arrangements with his various mortgagees where the first plaintiff assumed a disproportionately unequal risk in each of the three mortgages, BNP, NAB and the White and Vesaro mortgages. The defendant was a party to the first plaintiff assuming the liabilities of the joint ventures. 
          
          
         The defendant also failed to honour the agreement evidenced by the documents given in 1991 and 1993, he failed to fully disclose or record his liabilities under the joint venture agreement. The defendant also failed to advise the first plaintiff of his views of the joint venture property. 
          
          
         I find that the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to the first plaintiff which he owed as a joint venturer as set out in the preceding paragraphs. 
         
        
       
     48 In relation to the fourth matter, concerning the Legal Profession Act, the primary judge set out the relevant subsection of s.119 of that Act, as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         119. Receipts not to be shared by solicitor and unqualified person 
          
         1) It is professional misconduct for a solicitor to share with another person the receipts of a business of the kind usually conducted by a solicitor unless: 
          
           
           a) the other person holds a current practising certificate issued by the Law Society Council; or 
            
           b) the Law Society Council has first given its consent. 
           
          
         
        
       
     49 His Honour made the following finding: 
      
       
        
         
         If the legislature had intended to prohibit the sharing of profits it would have done so, and would not have provided a procedure whereby permission may be obtained. I reject the submission that the joint venture was thereby illegal. 
         
        
       
     50 In relation to the Limitation Act 1969, the primary judge stated that he had not had submissions from the appellants as to whether the amendment to add a defence under the Limitation Act ought to occur. He said that he wished to hear from Counsel as to the way in which the Limitation Act affected the personal injury claim and the way in which the Act ought to be applied in relation to equitable relief. He also expressed concern that the appellants’ Counsel, in his closing oral address, had limited the claim to a claim arising out of the formation of the original joint venture agreement, and treated the damages as indivisible. In case some of the claims might be statute barred, the primary judge said that he wished to have submissions as to how damages might be divided.  
      
       
     51 On 8th February 2001, the appellants provided some further submissions, which did not add in any significant way to the submissions provided at the close of the hearing. The respondent provided further submissions on 1st March 2001, and there was a short hearing on 2nd March 2001.  
      
       
     52 On 27th April 2001, the primary judge gave a judgment on the Limitation Act question. The primary judge noted the appellants’ argument that the defences under the Limitation Act had no merit, and noted the appellant’s reliance on Wardley Australia Limited v. Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514. He continued: 
      
       
        
         
         Clearly in these proceedings, the first plaintiff’s case is that he suffered damages immediately on the coming into effect of the contract, and thus his cause of action in contract and tort takes effect from February 1989. 
          
          
         It is necessary therefore to look at the limitation defences, to the actions in contract, tort and arising out of breach of fiduciary duty. 
          
          
         The claim in contract clearly envisages and seeks compensation for loss of the former employment when the first plaintiff entered into the joint venture. This was actual damage not contingent or prospective. His loss of employment with his former employer with CMA crystallises the cause of action in contract. In any event, an action in contract runs from the breach regardless of when the damage occurs ( 
         inter alia 
         ), although the time of the breach of contract is not always easy to determine: see  
         Sheldon v McBeth 
          (1993) Aust Torts Reports 81-209. In these proceedings, the actual breach alleged was,  
         inter alia, 
          the failure to properly advise the first plaintiff in 1989. 
          
          
         The  
         Statute of Limitations 
         , in contract, being six years, the claim in respect of the joint venture agreement is therefore barred. 
          
          
         Similarly, the action brought in tort against the defendant, which sounds in damages, it being specifically claimed from the date of the breach, the action having been in respect of negligent advice and failure to disclose relevant facts concerning the joint venture given in 1989, is similarly barred, damages being an element of the tort, there being several events giving rise to damage or detriment to the first plaintiff in 1989. 
          
          
         I have been referred to and take into account a decision of the Court of Appeal in  
         Scarcella v Lettice 
          (2000) NSWCA 289, which reaffirms that time commences to run when damage occurs, even though the plaintiff may not be aware of it. 
          
          
         Notwithstanding that I have asked Counsel for the first plaintiff to specify damages arising out of subsequent breaches as pleaded and claimed by the first plaintiff, Senior Counsel for the first plaintiff has declined to do so on the basis that the  
         Limitation Act  
         defences do not arise and his assertion that there is no statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary duty. 
         
        
       
     53 The primary judge then considered the claim for equitable compensation, and referred to Maguire v. Makronis (1997) 198 CLR 449, s.23 of the Limitation Act 1969, Knox v. Gye (1872) LR 5HL 686 at 674, and Cia de Seguris Imperio v. Heath (REBX) Limited  I WLR 112. He then continued: 
      
       
        
         
         Although the manner of determination of damages may differ for equitable compensation, and although other equitable remedies may be available, the plaintiffs claims are, in effect, analogous to claims for damages at law, and are based on the same underpinning facts.  
          
          
         By the application of analogy therefore and s23 of the  
         Limitation Act 
          1969, the first plaintiff is barred by the same argument as applies to the action in contract and tort in his action for breach of fiduciary duty for breaches occurring outside the limitation period. 
          
          
         The claim for aggravated damages for personal injury and exemplary damages, therefore are similarly statute barred. 
          
          
         In the second plaintiff’s claim, there was clearly a relationship established of solicitor and client between the second plaintiff and the defendant, in relation to the transfer of her house. Clearly however, any action in contract or in negligence, or breach of other duty, arose in 1989 at the time of the failure to proceed with the stamping and lodgement of the transfer, and the obtaining of the mortgagee’s consent for registration of the transfer. However, in any event detriment was suffered by the second plaintiff when the property was encumbered in 1989. This brings the cause of action beyond the  
         Limitation Act 
          1969 limitation period, and therefore the defendant has a good defence to the action of the second plaintiff, in the pleading of the  
         Limitation Act 
          1969.  
          
          
         Accordingly, on the basis that the defendant has a good defence, and for the other reasons that I have set out above, in applying  
         JL Holdings v State of Queensland 
         , the defendant should have leave to file the Defence to the Fourth Amended Statement of Claim to include the defence under the  
         Limitation Act 
         . 
          
          
          For the reasons I have set out above, the second plaintiff is therefore statute barred and the first plaintiff is statute barred for those causes of action beyond the six year period provided by the  
         Limitation Act 
          1969.  
          
          
         Notwithstanding my invitation in the judgment of 18 December 2000 for the parties to set out each breach of duty respectively caused in the various activities carried out by the defendant, some of which are subsequent to the limitation period, I consider that the defeat of that part of the first plaintiff’s claim by the defence of the  
         Statute of Limitations 
          1969 should not prevent the first plaintiff from particularising such damages as he may seek to argue, that he has suffered from the breach of the defendants’ solicitors retainer, or the failure to advise that he should obtain independent advice, or any negligence advice that may have been tendered, subsequent to the  
         Limitation Act 
          period.  
          
          
         I will allow a further period of twenty-eight days for such claim to be articulated. I will then determine any issues which may then arise. 
         
        
       
     54 The first plaintiff did not take up the invitation contained in the last of those paragraphs, and in the result the primary judge gave the judgments in favour of the respondent to which I referred at the beginning of this judgment. 
      
       
        
       ISSUES ON APPEAL 
       
     55 The grounds of appeal set out in the Amended Notice of Appeal filed on 5th July 2001 were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The Plaintiffs were denied procedural fairness in the conduct of the proceedings before Dowd J. in that: 
          
         (a) undue and unnecessary delay occurred in delivering judgment(s); 
          
         (b) his Honour failed to determine all necessary matters in one judgment or at all; 
          
         (c) his Honour called for further submissions 10 months after the hearing had taken place in circumstances in which further submissions were neither necessary nor appropriate; 
          
         (d the delay and calling for additional submissions permitted the Defendant to raise or further raise (erroneous) matters 12 months after the completion of the hearing; 
          
         (e) in holding that the First Plaintiff’s claims were time barred his Honour adopted, as the basis for his reasoning, submissions made by the Defendant on 1 March 2001, 12 months after the completion of the hearing, which contained erroneous matters. 
          
          
         2. Delay in determining the limitation issues and in giving judgment. 
          
          
         2A. His Honour erred in granting leave to the Defendant to amend his defence to raise limitation issues. 
          
          
         3.His Honour erred in holding that the First Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for negligence as a solicitor was barred by the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). 
          
          
         4. His Honour erred in holding that the First Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant as joint venturer was barred by the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). 
          
          
         5. His Honour erred in holding that the First Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant as a fiduciary was barred ""for breaches occurring outside the limitation period"". 
          
          
         6. His Honour erred in holding that the Second Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant was barred by the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). 
          
          
         7. In holding that the First and Second Plaintiffs’ claims were time barred, his Honour failed to make necessary findings of fact, inter alia, in relation to causation of damage. 
          
          
         8. His Honour failed to provide any or any proper reasons for holding that the First and Second Plaintiffs' claims were time barred. 
          
          
         9. In his judgment of 27 Apri1 2001, his Honour: 
          
         (a) misunderstood the nature of the First Plaintiff’s case; 
          
         (b) misunderstood the nature of the Second Plaintiff’s case; 
          
         (c) misunderstood the evidence that had been given; 
          
         (d) misunderstood the law in relation to time limitations; 
          
          
         10. His Honour misstated the First Plaintiff’s case in paragraph 18 of his Honour's judgment (of 27 April 2001) where it is said that it was the First Plaintiff’s case that he suffered damage immediately on the coming into effect of ""the contract"" (presumably a reference to the joint venture agreement); and in paragraph 22 of the judgment of 27 April 2001 where it is said that damages were ""specifically claimed from the date of the breach"" (presumably a reference to 1989). 
          
          
         11. His Honour erred (paragraph 20 judgment 27 April 2001) in finding that the First Plaintiff’s ""loss of employment with his former employer"" constituted damage, when in no sense did the First Plaintiff lose his employment and when the evidence was that he suffered no diminution in income immediately after the buyout. 
          
          
         12. His Honour erred in finding that the Second Plaintiff suffered damage immediately upon executing the transfer (in August 1989) when no damage of any kind was suffered by her at that time. 
          
          
         13. In the ""judgment"" of 18 December 2000, his Honour erred in holding that the arrangement entered into in regard to the sharing of profits in the Defendant's legal practice was not illegal and not prohibited by s.119 of the Legal Profession Act 1987. 
         
        
       
     56 The orders sought were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         1. The judgment of his Honour Justice Dowd of 27 April 2001 and orders of 22 June 2001 be set aside and judgment entered for the Appellants with damages to be assessed. 
          
          
         2. The matter be remitted to a Judge of the Supreme Court (other than Dowd J) for assessment of damages. 
          
          
         3. In the alternative to Order 2 hereof, the Court of Appeal assess damages. 
          
          
         4. The Respondent be ordered to pay the costs of this Appeal and of the proceedings below on an indemnity basis. 
         
        
       
     57 The respondent filed a Notice of Contention, to the effect that the orders should be affirmed on the following grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         1. On the evidence of the Appellants themselves and objective facts before the Court, there was no basis upon which the Trial Judge could properly have found that the Respondent had owed or breached any relevant duty to the Appellants, that they had suffered damage to them by such a breach, or that the damages claimed by them were otherwise than too remote (or, in law, unable) to be held to his account. 
          
          
         2. The Trial Judge erred in holding that there was a presumption operative against the Respondent, and in favour of the First Appellant, arising from the fact that the Respondent was a solicitor. 
          
          
         3. The Trial Judge erred in holding that, despite an absence of evidence, the Respondent should be held to have failed to fulfil obligations he had to the First Appellant as a solicitor. 
          
          
         4. The Trial Judge erred in holding that the Respondent had breached fiduciary duties owed by him to the First Appellant as a joint venturer. 
         
        
        
       In this Notice of Contention, the respondent also contended that the appeal was incompetent, but, subject to an order that the appellants pay the costs of the Notice of Motion filed 29th May 2001 and their application for leave, he did not object to an order being made so as to enable the appeal to proceed. 
        
       
     58 I propose to deal in turn with the following broad issues:  
      
       
       1. The issue of procedural fairness and delay (Grounds 1 and 2) and deficiency of reasons (Grounds 7 and 8).  
        
       2. The question of whether there was error in upholding the Limitation Act defence against the first appellant’s claim (Grounds 3-5 and 9-11).  
        
       3. The question whether there was error in upholding the Limitation Act defence to the second appellant’s claim (Grounds 6 and 12). 
        
       4. The question whether there was error in relation to s.119 of the Legal Profession Act (Ground 13).  
        
       5. The issues raised by the Notice of Contention. 
        
       
     59 I note that Ground 2A in the Amended Notice of Appeal was abandoned at the hearing. In the light of the concession made by Senior Counsel for the appellants on 28th February 2000 that he could not claim any prejudice (whether this was in fact the case or not), this ground of appeal had no chance of succeeding.  
      
       
        
       PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND DEFICIENCY OF REASONS 
       
     60 As contended by Mr. Roberts SC for the appellants, it is clear that paragraph 18 of the judgment of 27th April 2001, asserting that “the first plaintiff’s case is that he suffered damages immediately on the coming into effect of the contract”, did misstate the first appellant’s claim. The damage referred to in the Statement of Claim is all damage occurring from about 1993 onwards. It is correct that the first appellant claimed that, at about the time of entry into the joint venture in early 1989, he did leave secure employment; but whether or not this amounts to damage in the relevant sense is not an easy question. In my opinion, as will appear from my discussion of the second issue, the question of when the first appellant relevantly first suffered damage from the breaches alleged against the respondent is a mixed question of fact and law of some difficulty, which was not addressed at all in the reasons of the primary judge. In my opinion, this means that there would have to be a new trial, unless the result arrived at by the primary judge is plainly correct, or the orders which he made were inevitable having regard to the matters in the respondent’s Notice of Contention; and as will be seen, neither of these alternatives is made good. 
      
       
     61 Accordingly, there is no necessity to consider in detail the other aspects of alleged lack of procedural fairness, delay and deficiency of reasons. However, I think it is appropriate to comment briefly on two aspects.  
      
       
     62 Firstly, in my opinion the proceedings at first instance have miscarried in part because of the primary judge’s failure to rule on 28th February 2000 on whether an amendment to include the Limitation Act defence should be permitted. One result of this is that it appears that no consideration was given at the time as to whether the appellants would wish to put on any reply to such a defence, such as a reply of fraudulent concealment under s.55(1)(b) of the Limitation Act. The appellants have sought to rely on that matter in this appeal, and understandably the respondent has objected to that on the basis that the case has been heard without the allegation of fraud required for such a pleading having been made.  
      
       
     63 Secondly, problems have arisen from the delay in giving judgment, and particularly from the form in which the first judgment of 18th December 2000 was given. That judgment contained very few findings of primary fact, and made findings of breaches of duty only in the most generalised terms and on the basis of very sketchy reasons. It made no findings as to what damage was suffered, or, very importantly in this case, what damage, if any, was caused by what breaches of duty. This in turn meant that the opportunities offered to the appellants in the judgment of 18th December 2000 to make further submissions concerning personal injuries, equitable relief, and how damage may be divided, were justifiably regarded by the appellants as coming too late. In my opinion, either such opportunity should have been given at the very latest shortly after the conclusion of the hearing, or else the primary judge should have done his best to decide the case on the material which he had. A fortiori, the further opportunity offered in the judgment of 27th April 2001 was far too late. 
      
       
        
       LIMITATION DEFENCE TO FIRST APPELLANT’S CLAIM 
       
     64 As noted earlier, the first appellant’s specification of damage did not include damage occurring prior to 1993.  
      
       
     65 In order to make out his case, the first appellant had the onus of proving some damage as alleged, and of proving that it was caused by breaches of duty established in the case. To make out his defence based on the Limitation Act in respect of the claim in tort, the respondent had the onus of proving that damage was in fact suffered from the relevant breach or breaches prior to the middle of 1990. He could do this either by showing that, if the first appellant suffered the damage claimed by the first appellant, then this must have involved damage suffered prior to mid-1990; or alternatively by proving that the first appellant did in fact suffer damage from the relevant breach or breaches prior to mid-1990.  
      
       
     66 Mr. Lindsay SC for the respondent submitted that the respondent did do this. He submitted that the first appellant always put his case on the basis that the whole of the loss was caused by entry into the joint venture in about early 1989, and made no attempt to separate out later damage caused by later breaches. In particular, he submitted, the first appellant claimed that in about early 1989 he entered into a disadvantageous joint venture, and gave up secure employment. This necessarily involved loss or damage, particularly where on the first appellant’s case the joint venture had no settled terms, was induced by misrepresentation, was liable to be set aside, and did not have the backing of a substantial legal practice as the respondent allegedly had represented. Mr. Lindsay also submitted that by early 1989 the first appellant’s house had been mortgaged to secure the debts of the business. 
      
       
     67 In my opinion, there is force in these submissions, but they are far from conclusive; and for reasons I will give, I am not satisfied that the primary judge’s conclusion on the limitation defence was correct. 
      
       
     68 It is true that the first appellant’s case for damages depended upon an assertion that he would not have entered into the joint venture at all but for various breaches of duty by the respondent; but that does not show that entry into the joint venture was at the time of its occurrence a loss sounding in damages. If it had been shown that the true value of what the first appellant obtained in early 1989, assessed as at that time, was less than the true value of what the first appellant gave up, assessed at that time, then this would be such a loss: but that question was not addressed by the evidence and not considered by the primary judge; and in my opinion the available material is insufficient for this Court to address the question and come to any conclusion on it. In all probability, it would require an assessment of competing commercial chances, viewed as at early 1989.  
      
       
     69 It would appear that the joint venture may have been of less value to the first appellant than it would have been if it had been properly documented, if there had been the backing of a substantial legal practice, and if the respondent had negotiated a more secure distribution agreement; and these matters would be directly relevant to a cause of action based on contract or a cause of action which in some other way made the respondent liable for respects in which what the first appellant obtained did not measure up to what he would have obtained if the respondent had fulfilled his commitments. However, they are less directly relevant to the tort measure of damages which, on the way the first appellant put his case, required an overall comparison between the first appellant’s situation if he had not entered into the venture at all, with his situation which actually arose when he did enter into the venture.  
      
       
     70 On the question whether giving up secure employment was itself a loss or damage, I note first that it was not shown that the real benefits received by the first appellant from the new arrangement were less than the benefits from the secure employment, prior to about 1993. In those circumstances, I think the question of whether giving up secure employment amounted to loss or damage depends upon the type of general comparison to which I have referred previously.  
      
       
     71 The mortgaging of the first appellant’s house to give security for debts of the business could be a relevant loss or detriment: see Forster v. Outred & Co [1982] 1 WLR 86, discussed but not disapproved by the High Court of Australia in Wardley Australia Limited v. Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514. However, this was not relied on before Dowd J; and even if it had been, in my opinion the better view is that this too would need to be taken into account in an overall comparison of the type to which I have referred, rather than considered in isolation. As I will attempt to show, I think this follows from an analysis of Wardley and Forster, particularly having regard to principles discussed in Sellars v. Adelaide Petroleum (1994) 179 CLR 332.  
      
       
     72 I accept that, if one can point to an actual loss of money or property, or a non-receipt of money or property, or damage to property, or to some physical or psychological injury, it is not possible to say that no loss or damage has occurred simply because of the possibility that the plaintiff has obtained some countervailing advantage. But it is at least strongly arguable, as a matter of mixed fact and law, that nothing like this occurred in this case until about 1993; so that the defendant’s claim that, if the plaintiffs suffered damage at all from breaches of duty occurring around the time of entry into the joint venture agreement, it must have involved loss or damage suffered at that time, must depend upon a global comparison of the type to which I have referred. As mentioned earlier, that global comparison was not undertaken below, and the material does not enable this Court to undertake it.  
      
       
     73 It remains on this question to state briefly how I see the above propositions resulting from the decisions in Wardley and Forster and Sellars.  
      
       
     74 Wardley established that a person granting an indemnity, under which he or she is obliged to make a payment when the loss of the party to be indemnified is ascertained and quantified, suffers no actual loss until this contingency is fulfilled; so that a cause of action for purely economic loss, dependent upon damage being caused by the granting of the indemnity, does not arise until that contingency occurs. However, during the discussion of this question at 175 CLR 527-533, the majority of the High Court did not disapprove of Forster v. Outred, where it was held that a plaintiff suffered actual loss, not merely prospective loss, when, on negligent advice from her solicitors, she executed a mortgage over her property to secure debts of her son. Their Honours explained this case by reference to the immediate effect of the mortgage on the value of the plaintiff’s property, which had previously been free from encumbrances. 
      
       
     75 Sellars decided that loss or damage may be established by demonstrating the loss of a commercial opportunity which had some value, not being a negligible value, this value being ascertained by reference to degrees of probabilities or possibilities: see 179 CLR at 355.  
      
       
     76 Thus it would seem that, if one can characterise an economic disadvantage suffered by a plaintiff as involving the loss of a commercial opportunity which has some value, then that will be enough to constitute actual damage and to complete a cause of action (Sellars). However, if the economic disadvantage is no more than a contingency for future loss, then, unless and until the contingency occurs, there is no damage and no cause of action (Wardley). If one has a mortgage encumbering a property which was previously unencumbered, in isolation, then the effect of the mortgage on the value of the property will constitute immediate loss (Forster). However, if that encumbrance is part of an overall arrangement with some benefits as well as burdens, then in my opinion the matter has to be approached applying the principles derived from Sellars and Wardley.  
      
       
     77 My views on this principal question means that it is not absolutely necessary for me to deal with other matters arising in relation to this issue; but I will do so briefly.  
      
       
     78 First, there is the question whether different considerations apply to the first appellant’s claim for psychological injury. There is authority that there are distinct causes of action for personal injuries and property damage arising out of the same negligent act of a defendant: see Brunsden v. Humphrey (1884) 14 QBD 141, Marlborough Harbour Board v. Chartered Travel Co. Limited (1989) 18 NSWLR 223. However, I do not think that would apply in a case such as the present, where it is alleged that the personal injury itself was occasioned through the commercial loss: cf Avenhouse v. Hornsby Shire Council (1988) 44 NSWLR 1. That is, there is in this case no allegation of a duty to protect or preserve the first appellant from mental or physical injury: the duties alleged are essentially to protect the first appellant from commercial harm. Accordingly, subject to what I say next, the claim for psychological injury would be barred if the claim for commercial loss is barred. 
      
       
     79 There is however the question of whether, in relation to this part of the first appellant’s claim, an extension might have been sought under Schedule 5 and s.60G of the Limitation Act. It seems to me arguable that an action claiming personal injuries occasioned by commercial loss, if otherwise maintainable, may fall within s.60G as a cause of action founded on breach of duty for damages for personal injury. No application under s.60G was in fact made in this case. Such an application should have been made or foreshadowed, at the latest, on 28th February 2000; but the failure to make such application can reasonably be regarded as in part due to the respondent’s belated application to add the Limitation Act defence.  
      
       
     80 Much the same comments apply in relation to the first appellant’s attempt to rely on fraudulent concealment. If this was to be relied on, notice of this should have been given, at the latest, on 28th February 2000; but again, one may reasonably regard the failure to do so as caused in part by the respondent’s belated application to rely on the Limitation Act.  
      
       
     81 In relation to the application of the Limitation Act to a cause of action for damages or compensation for breach of fiduciary duty, it would appear that s.23 means that the six year limitation period does not apply, except by analogy. Williams v. Minister, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (1994) 35 NSWLR 497 could be seen as authority for at least the proposition that the six year limitation should not automatically be applied to such a claim, and that it is necessary to consider factors relevant to the aptness of the analogy. One matter that might be relevant here is that the extension provided by s.55 of the Limitation Act for fraudulent concealment would not directly apply to such a claim, because in relation to such a claim there is no “limitation period fixed by or under this Act” within the meaning of s.55(1): it might be that considerations relating to the appropriateness of applying the six year limitation by analogy would include matters which would go to fraudulent concealment of a claim to which the Limitation Act does apply. If that were so, then the absence of a reply might not be fatal to reliance on facts amounting to fraudulent concealment in relation to the equitable claims. The view of Deane J in Hawkins v. Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 589 might also have some bearing on this question. Although I am far from satisfied that it would not be appropriate to apply a six year period by analogy, I do not think this issue was adequately addressed by the primary judge.  
      
       
     82 Finally on this topic, there was a submission by the first appellant that the primary judge should have considered whether there were causes of action arising after mid-1990 due to breaches occurring after that date or breaches in respect of which damage first occurred after that date. In my opinion, it would have been a denial of natural justice to the respondent in this case to have made a finding against the respondent on any such basis, in circumstances where a claim on that basis had not been formulated with any clarity by the first appellant. A plaintiff must put a claim in some reasonably clear way before a court can give effect to it, because otherwise the defendant cannot adequately respond to it and a court would deny the defendant natural justice if it gave effect to such a claim. It is not enough to include in a global claim for damages some items of damage that might be held referable to particular breaches occurring within the limitation period. In my opinion, the circumstance that the allegations of breach of duty in this case included allegations of breaches in relation to the White and Vesaro mortgages and the Roden transaction, and the list of damage included items relating to those transactions, did not amount to a sufficiently clear formulation of a distinct claim arising within the limitation period. 
      
       
     83 However, I note that the primary judge did feel that the conduct of the case made it appropriate that the first appellant be given an opportunity to clarify such a claim; but he did so at a time and in circumstances where the first appellant could reasonably feel that to do so would result in further unacceptable delay. The limitation question was argued at the hearing and in written submissions shortly thereafter, so in my opinion the invitation should have been given, if at all, at that time and not in December 2000 and/or April 2001. Thus, the failure to consider distinct claims arising since mid-1990, although it may not of itself have justified a new trial, does add some weight to the need for a new trial.  
      
       
        
       LIMITATION DEFENCE TO THE SECOND APPELLANT’S CLAIM 
       
     84 Although this claim is not clearly pleaded in this way, I think it should be understood as alleging a continuing breach. In my opinion also, on a fair construction of the Statement of Claim, the second appellant accepted that the duty on the respondent to effect a transfer of her interest was not something that could have prevented the charge in favour of BNP arising. The gravamen of the complaint is that, not only was there no attempt to remove that charge from the second appellant’s half interest, but also that half interest was further burdened later on by transactions with the NAB and in connection with the White and Vesaro mortgages. Viewed in that way, the second appellant’s claim was in my opinion plainly not statute barred.  
      
       
     85 However, the value of that claim was vastly less than alleged by the second appellant. The Statement of Claim apparently put the value at $450,000.00, equating it with the loss of the house. The written submissions put it at around $288,000.00, namely the difference between the value of the house and the $162,000.00 which the second appellant received from the sale proceeds of the house. In my opinion, at the very highest the second appellant’s claim would be for one-half the value of the house ($225,000.00) less one-half the $70,000.00 or thereabouts still owing from the finance used to obtain the house, less the $162,000.00 which the second appellant actually received, giving a figure of $28,000.00. Indeed, the claim would probably be less than this: the evidence did not show any realistic chance of getting rid of the BNP’s $200,000.00 charge, so that this $200,000.00 plus the first appellant’s share of the $70,000.00 (235,000.00 in all) also had to come out of the property. $225,000.00 of this would come from the first appellant’s share, leaving $10,000.00 to come from the second appellant’s share, reducing her claim to about $18,000.00. 
      
       
        
       LEGAL PROFESSION ACT SECTION 119 
       
     86 The primary judge’s decision on this question has little bearing on the result of the case, either on this appeal or on any re-trial. I think it would be best not to enter into this question in this judgment.  
      
       
        
       NOTICE OF CONTENTION 
       
     87 Oral submissions did not deal with the Notice of Contention. I would take the view that the findings made by the primary judge as to breaches of the respondent’s duties were in a form insufficiently precise to be the basis for any assessment of damages, and that there is a real question as to whether they were adequately supported by reasons. However, I think it is clear that it is not possible for this Court to say that the material before the primary judge could not justify appropriate findings of breaches of duty of the type alleged in the Statement of Claim.  
      
       
        
       RELIEF ON APPEAL 
       
     88 The appellants’ Amended Notice of Appeal sought orders that judgment be entered for the appellants with damages to be assessed, that the matter be remitted to a judge of the Supreme Court other than the primary judge for assessment of damages, and in the alternative, that the Court of Appeal assess damages. No order for a new trial was sought. In my opinion, it is plain beyond any argument that it would not be appropriate for judgment to be entered for the appellants for damages to be assessed. In my opinion, the appeal succeeds essentially on grounds related to deficiencies in the reasons and in the process, and not because I am to any degree satisfied that the appellants are entitled to a judgment. Furthermore, as just noted, the findings of breach of duty made by the primary judge were totally inadequate to support a judgment for the appellants for damages to be assessed; and in any event, there was no finding as to causation of damage.  
      
       
     89 Although this has not been sought by the appellants, in my opinion the appropriate order is for a new trial on all issues before a judge other than the primary judge. There should in my opinion be further orders with a view to ensuring that the trial does not miscarry again. A large factor in causing the trial to miscarry has been the lack of precision in the appellants’ pleading. It is not acceptable to plead a series of breaches occurring over many years, and then to make a global pleading of damage caused by all the breaches. While it may be appropriate to bring a claim arising out of an ongoing relationship, involving a number of breaches occurring over many years, and while it could be productive of complexity and repetition to require each individual breach to be explicitly linked to allegations of damage caused by that breach, a pleading should enable definition, in a way fair to both parties, of issues concerning breach, causation and quantum of damage in relation to each cause of action relied on. It may be possible to group causes of action where the damage involved in each of them are substantially the same, so long as this can be done without obscuring issues of causation and quantum of damages arising in relation to each of them. The pleading in this case was grossly inadequate in this regard, and in my opinion would be liable to be struck out. I propose to order that the appellants, within 28 days, serve a fresh draft Statement of Claim which does appropriately raise issues concerning causation and quantum of damages in relation to each substantially distinct cause of action relied on.  
      
       
        
       COSTS 
       
     90 The miscarriage of these proceedings was in part the result of the inadequate Statement of Claim. It was also in part the result of the limitation defence being raised after the commencement of the hearing. The respondent has made no attempt before us to argue that this was truly justified by the extent of the change made between the third and fourth versions of the Statement of Claim. In my opinion, it is appropriate to leave the costs of the first trial in the discretion of the judge who hears the new trial.  
      
       
     91 Turning to the costs of the appeal, it would seem that the respondent is entitled to some costs. The appeal was incompetent when first brought, and the motion to strike it out was justified. Once final orders had been made below, the respondent sensibly took the approach that the appeal should be dealt with on its merits, but costs had been incurred in the meantime.  
      
       
     92 Some costs were incurred by reason of inclusion of the hopeless Ground 2A. Neither before the primary judge nor in written submissions was there any significant attempt by the appellants to deal explicitly with the respondent’s contention that the loss of secure employment and the entry into the unsatisfactory joint venture were themselves losses which completed the cause of action. The Amended Notice of Appeal did not even seek the only form of relief which could possibly have been granted, and which has been granted, namely a new trial.  
      
       
     93 In all the circumstances, in my opinion the appropriate order is that each party pay its own costs of the appeal, with the respondent having a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if otherwise entitled.  
      
       
        
       ORDERS 
       
     94 Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
      
       
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       2. Orders made by primary judge on 22nd June 2001 set aside. 
        
       3. Matter remitted to Common Law Division for a new trial before a different judge. 
        
       4. Costs of first trial to be in the discretion of the judge hearing the new trial. 
        
       5. Each party to pay its own costs of the appeal, the respondent to have a Suitors’ Fund Act certificate in respect of its costs if otherwise entitled. 
        
       6. Order that the appellants within 28 days serve a fresh draft Statement of Claim which appropriately raises issues concerning causation and quantum of damages in relation to each substantially distinct cause of action relied on.

      Regina v Van Ngung Hoang 
       
      Judgment 
     1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Van Ngung Hoang, was found guilty at his trial in the District Court of a charge of supplying heroin. He was sentenced to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
      
       
     2 Only a very brief recital of the facts is necessary. In the early evening of 30 November 2000 a police officer attended the scene of an accident on the Federal Highway near Goulburn. The applicant was present at the scene, his car having run into a ditch at the side of the roadway. He was found to be in possession of the subject heroin, which he had attempted to conceal. He declined to be interviewed about it. The heroin was subjected to analysis and was found to weigh 54.8g. At the trial the Crown relied upon the deeming provision to be found in s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  
      
       
     3 The learned trial judge pronounced sentence after comprehensive remarks which considered all relevant matters, objective and subjective. His Honour noted that there was no evidence that the applicant was himself a drug user. This led to a passage in the remarks on sentence which gives rise to the only matter complained of in this application:  
      
       
        
         
         … on the finding of the jury, this is a case where the offender is a dealer, that he is using the sale of drugs for greed. I refer to some remarks made by their Honours in the Court of Criminal Appeal case of Robert Francis Tulloh: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “The user/dealer who sells drugs primarily to feed his own habit is at a lower level of criminality than the trafficker for greed….” (R v Tulloh 
            NSW CCA, unreported, 16 September 1993) 
           
          
         
        
       
     4 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Fliece, submitted that the finding that his client was a dealer was not open to his Honour. He pointed out, rightly, that the jury’s verdict meant no more than that the applicant had the heroin in his possession for supply and the evidence did not establish with any greater specificity what he was going to do with it. As I understand it, at the trial the applicant denied being in possession of the drug and continued to maintain his innocence after the verdict. 
      
       
     5 Read in context, it does not appear to me that his Honour was saying any more than that he was satisfied that the applicant had been involved in a dealing with the heroin for profit and could not assert in mitigation of sentence that he himself was an addict. It is true that “supply” does not necessarily mean “sale” but, given the amount of heroin found, the conclusion that the applicant was acting in the expectation of financial gain was readily available. Mr Fliece raised the possibility that the applicant was merely transporting the heroin as a courier. Even if that were so, he would still have been involved in a transaction for profit. In any event, the evidence was such that an examination of the precise nature of his enterprise was neither possible nor necessary for the purpose of sentence: cf The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
      
       
     6 It may be that his Honour used the word “dealer” somewhat loosely, but I am not persuaded that he fell into the error for which counsel contends. It was not argued that, otherwise, the sentence is manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     7 NEWMAN AJ: I agree.

      Regina v Geoffrey William Barnier 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: I agree with Hidden J. 
      
       
     2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Geoffrey William Barnier, was tried in the District Court before Ainslie-Wallace DCJ and a jury upon a charge of supplying methyl-amphetamine. The Crown relied upon the deeming provision in s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was found guilty and appeals to this Court against his conviction.  
      
       
     3 The facts can be stated shortly. At about 5.30am Federal Police officers, armed with a search warrant, went to a house at Wetherill Park occupied by the appellant. The appellant admitted them to the house. Also present there was a woman, who later left. One of the police officers, Federal Agent McQuillan, asked the appellant if there was anything in the house which should not be there. The appellant said that there was, in the kitchen. He added that “a guy” had come to the house the previous day and asked if he could leave a package there. The appellant agreed and he saw that man put the article in the kitchen. The effect of what the appellant told the police was that he was aware that the package contained a drug of some kind but he denied that it was his, saying that he had nothing to do with the drugs. He added that he thought that he had been set up.  
      
       
     4 The appellant led the police to the kitchen area and pointed to a hole in the wall above a pantry cupboard. He then pointed to the floor and Mr McQuillan saw a small opening in the skirting board at floor level. Inside that opening he found a clear plastic bag containing the methyl amphetamine the subject of the charge. (It may be that the bag was placed in the wall cavity above the cupboard and fell to the position where it was found, but it does not appear to me that anything turns on this.) Asked what he could tell police about the contents of the bag, the appellant replied, “Well, I don’t really know what it is. It wasn’t mine and it wasn’t there to sell. It was there for somebody.” He said that that person told him that he just wished to leave the package there and that he would come back and get it. 
      
       
     5 There was no evidence of any identifiable fingerprints on the package or of any other indicia of supply, such as scales or plastic bags. The evidence was silent about whether the house was occupied by anyone other than the appellant. There was unchallenged evidence that the woman who had been present when police arrived had nothing to do with the matter. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 
      
       
     6 The learned trial judge left the issue of possession to the jury, explaining that the Crown bore the burden of proving not only that the appellant was aware of the presence of the drug at the house but that he exercised dominion over it, in the sense that he had “the intention and the ability to exercise exclusive control” over it. Her Honour also left to the jury the issue of whether the appellant had the drug for a purpose other than supply, assuming they were satisfied that he was in possession of it. Applying this Court’s decision in R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292, she directed them that the appellant would be entitled to be acquitted if they were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was merely minding the drug for someone, as he had claimed.  
      
       
     7 The only ground of appeal is that the jury’s verdict is unreasonable, being unsupported by the evidence. In this Court the appellant was represented by Mr Cook of counsel, who did not appear at the trial. Argument centred upon the adequacy of the evidence to establish possession. Of course, the circumstances described by the appellant in which the drug came to be in the house are not inconsistent with his being in possession of it: cf Carey, per Hunt J (as he then was) at 297. However, the jury may well have treated the appellant’s account with considerable scepticism. Certainly, their verdict demonstrates that they were not satisfied of it on the balance of probabilities. It was not the Crown case at the trial that he was in possession of the package jointly with someone else. From the summing-up, it appears that the Crown prosecutor argued to the jury that the appellant told the police what he did in an attempt to distance himself from the drug.  
      
       
     8 Before us, Mr Cook’s submission was that, while it was common ground that the appellant knew of the presence of the drug, the evidence failed to establish that he exercised dominion over it. This submission was founded upon the appellant’s account to the police. Mr Cook argued that the evidence did not establish that the appellant was the only occupant of the house. He relied upon the decision of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in Solway (1984) 11 ACrim R 449, but the facts of that case were significantly differently from this case.  
      
       
     9 In Solway the undisputed evidence was that someone other than the appellant had placed marijuana in a bathroom cupboard in the house where he lived. He was aware that the drug was there but he made no claim to it and did nothing to it, such as moving or hiding it, although he did tell police that he had intended at some time to “dump it”. He was not the only occupant of the house and, in particular, not the only person with access to the cupboard. The court held that this evidence could not establish that he was in possession of the marijuana, even though he had an intention to dispose of it at some future time. 
      
       
     10 As I have said, the evidence in the present case was silent about whether anyone else occupied the appellant’s home. I have referred also to the unchallenged evidence excluding the woman who was present when police arrived at the house from any involvement with the drug. From a reading of the summing-up, and some legal argument before it which is recorded in the transcript, it is clear that it was never suggested that anyone else had access to the house and the trial appears to have been conducted upon the basis that the appellant was its only occupant. That being so, and given the manner in which the drug was secreted in the kitchen, there was ample evidence to establish that it was under the appellant’s exclusive control. 
      
       
     11 Accordingly, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the element of possession. Equally, it was open to them to find that it was not in his possession for a purpose other than supply. The contrary was not suggested. 
      
       
     12 I would dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     13 BARR J: I agree with Hidden J.

       DATE: 4 December 2001 
       
       
       REGINA v PAUL ANTONIO COOPER 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 STEIN JA: The Court is in a position to proceed to judgment now in this appeal and I will ask Justice Howie to deliver the first judgment of the Court. 
     2 HOWIE J: By notice dated 5 March 2001 the applicant sought leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him on 27 February 2001 by Judge Coleman QC. That sentence was one of two passed upon the applicant by his Honour for offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty before the Local Court and for which he had been committed to the District Court for sentence pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act. The offences for which the applicant was sentenced were a charge of aggravated break enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act and a charge of larceny contrary to s 117 of that Act. It is the sentence for the first mentioned of those offences about which the applicant complains. 
     3 The applicant was legally represented in the District Court by a solicitor, Mr Doyle. At the outset of the proceedings Mr Doyle indicated to his Honour that the applicant adhered to the pleas of guilty entered before the magistrate. This was after the solicitor representing the Crown had indicated to his Honour that the applicant had pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, that is, to steal with people present and one count of larceny. After receiving into evidence the prosecution brief and hearing testimony from the applicant and his mother, Judge Coleman sentenced the applicant as follows: in respect of the offence of larceny, a fixed term of imprisonment for 4½ months to commence on 22 November 2000 and to expire on 6 April 2001; in respect of the aggravated break enter and steal offence, imprisonment for 3 years to commence on 22 February 2001 with a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 21 February 2003. 
     4 It is convenient to refer briefly to the facts of the two offences although I will need to return to consider the facts of the aggravated break, enter and steal offence in more detail later. The first offence in time was the larceny. On 21 November 2000 the applicant stole a large number of tools, fishing equipment and a rifle from a property where he had been staying with his girlfriend. The applicant removed the items from a shed on the property and placed them in his girlfriend’s vehicle intending to keep some and sell the others. He then drove the vehicle from the property and travelled the short distance into Wentworth in the South of this State. 
     5 At around 4 am that morning, the applicant gained entry through a closed but unlocked door into the home of the manager of a motel and in his wife. The house was a distinct dwelling located in front of the motel units. Before he entered the premises, the applicant took with him a butter knife that he said he found in the street outside the motel. The manager’s wife, who was awake at the time, heard somebody in the house and woke her husband. He found the applicant in the kitchen holding a mobile telephone and the knife. The manager confronted the applicant who immediately allowed these items to be taken from him and he remained compliantly in the kitchen until the police arrived. The applicant was then arrested and he admitted that he intended to steal the mobile phone. His girlfriend’s vehicle was located and the stolen property discovered. The applicant told police that the items taken belonged to his deceased brother and he believed he was entitled to them. 
     6 The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, apparently signed by the applicant, indicates that he desires only to appeal against sentence and refers only to his conviction of an offence of “aggravated burglary”. Under the heading “Grounds of Appeal or Application” on the Notice the following has been hand-written: 
      
       
        
        “I consider the sentence imposed is far too severe when the full facts are considered. I did not harm or threaten any person & I didn’t steal any property from the house where I was charged for illegal entering”. 
        
       
       
      The applicant had also indicated on the Notice that he wanted legal aid but did not wish to be present at the hearing of the appeal. 
       
     7 On 5 November 2001 the applicant wrote to the Registrar of this Court setting out the arguments that he wished to have this Court consider when determining his application. It seems that legal aid for the application had been refused and, therefore, the applicant was without legal representation. As is the normal procedure in such a case, the Registrar sought clarification of the matters that the applicant wished to have considered by the Court. The substance of the complaint set out in the applicant’s letter is that he was unaware of the nature of the charge under s 112(2) to which he had pleaded guilty and that had he been aware of the matter of aggravation relied upon, that is that he knew there was a person or persons in the house at the time of the offence, he would not have pleaded guilty. 
     8 In his letter the applicant refers to a communication between Mr Doyle, the solicitor who appeared for him before Coleman DCJ, and a solicitor named Ms Anderson that communication being set out in an advice from the Public Defender’s Chambers, presumably, as to the merits of any appeal for the purposes of a decision whether to grant the applicant legal aid for the application. The applicant complains in particular about the following material apparently set out in the advice that he had received: 
      
       
        
        “Mr Doyle told me [Ms Anderson] that he was aware of the mental element requiring the awareness of Mr Cooper that there was the likelihood that persons were within the dwelling. 
        
       
       
        
        Further Mr Doyle tells me that during the course of instructions Mr Cooper indicated that he was aware that the premises were in fact the premises of the manager of the hotel and consequently was aware that the manager and his wife were likely to be in the premises at the time he entered them”. 
        
       
     9 After referring to this material, the applicant states in his letter: 
      
       
        
        “This advice consequently proceeds (in the absence of instructions to the contrary) on the assumption that the plea of guilty to the aggravated charge was in fact properly entered. 
        
       
       
        
        I emphatically deny that any such conversation took place between Mr John Doyle and myself at any time prior to the trial. I do not know where Mr Doyle gained this information – but it certainly was not from myself. 
        
       
       
        
        I therefore contend that the plea of guilty to the aggravated charge was a totally incorrect assumption and was therefore incorrectly and improperly entered.” 
        
       
     10 The applicant then proceeds in his letter to refer to the evidence given before Judge Coleman as to his ingestion of alcohol and drugs prior to the commission of the offence and asserts that in his “confused state” it did not occur to him that the premises were occupied. He states that he remembers being shocked and surprised when he was confronted by someone in the house and this, he states, was the reason that he “immediately surrendered and offered any information requested”. 
     11 Throughout his letter to the Registrar the applicant repeatedly denies that there was any discussion with Mr Doyle about the issue of his knowledge as to the likelihood of any person being in the premises. He categorically refutes any suggestion that he indicated to his solicitor that he was in any way aware that there may have been persons present. The applicant’s letter concludes with the following statement: 
      
       
        
        “I believe that I have been unfairly dealt with in this matter and I do not believe that I should have been sentenced for break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation. 
        
       
       
        
        I have attempted to indicate to you throughout this letter that I do not agree that I am guilty of CIRCUMSTANCES OF AGGRAVATION, and it may be that I have not framed my statements in correct legal parlance - But the arguments I have shown above are all that I am able to provide to you as a means of support for the appeal”. 
        
       
     12 When this matter came before this Court differently constituted than it is at present, the Court was concerned about the matters raised by the applicant in his letter particularly in light of the fact that the application for leave purported to be against sentence only and that the applicant remained unrepresented. The Court adjourned the matter and asked that reconsideration might be given to the question of legal aid presumably in light of the material contained in the applicant’s letter. 
     13 The applicant remains unrepresented today but has appeared before the Court and relied upon the matters the substance of which he raised in his letter to the Registrar. In addition, he has placed before the Court (without objection by the Crown) an affidavit by him sworn on 4 December of this year. In the course of that affidavit the applicant, in effect, restates the complaints made by him about the conduct of his solicitor prior to the plea of guilty being entered, as he had done in the letter to the Registrar. However, the last two paragraphs of that affidavit should be referred to. They are as follows: 
      
       
       “11. After I had been sentenced I found out what ‘aggravate’ meant from other inmates who went up for the same charges. 
       
       
       12. I don’t remember anything of that night. I can remember little bits and pieces but that is all. I didn’t know where I was. The only thing I can remember is the man coming downstairs and I was shocked. I was shocked because I didn’t think anyone was there. I didn’t recognise the man. I didn’t know that I was somewhere where people lived. I remember that I thought I was going to a pub when I was in the place.” 
       
     14 In answer to matters raised in this affidavit the Crown has placed before this Court a tape recording of a record of interview made by the applicant with the arresting police some 2½ to 3 hours after his arrest in the manager’s dwelling house. The material contained in that record of interview and, in particular, the answers supplied by the applicant to the police are, in my view, inconsistent with those two paragraphs of the applicant’s affidavit which I have quoted above. The police officers, during the course of that interview, indicated to the applicant that the offence with which he was to be charged was aggravated break, enter and steal and that the circumstances of aggravation relied upon were to be the fact that he had a knife in his possession and that there were people in the premises into which he had entered, being the manager and his wife. 
     15 Further, the applicant, in his answers to the police, indicated that at least at that time he had a very clear recollection of the events of the evening, in particular, the way in which he entered into the premises of the dwelling house by scaling a six foot picket fence and then by pushing the door of the premises open. He told the police that he intended to get a drink of water and that he had seen lights on in the premises and that is why he entered. He told the police that he intended to steal the mobile telephone by taking it with him out of the premises when he left. He could not explain to the police why it was that he picked up the butter knife and took it with him into the premises. 
     16 Notwithstanding that there is no appeal against conviction and the applicant has raised these matters under an application for leave to appeal against sentence, the matters raised with respect to his plea and its appropriateness were ventilated during the hearing by way of evidence placed before this Court by both the applicant and the Crown. The Crown has also tendered an affidavit by Mr Doyle as to conversations that he says occurred between himself and the applicant and which confirms the material set out in advice from the Public Defenders’ Chambers to which I have earlier referred and which is disputed by the applicant. I should indicate that the applicant was not required for cross-examination and Mr Doyle did not appear to give evidence in this Court. However, it is unnecessary (for reasons that will hopefully become apparent) to detail Mr Doyle’s account of the instructions he received from the applicant or to attempt to resolve the dispute between him and the applicant about what instructions Mr Doyle had prior to him confirming the applicant’s adherence to his pleas before the magistrate. 
     17 The offence with which the applicant was charged in the Local Court and to which he pleaded guilty was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “That Paul Antonio Cooper on the 22nd day of November 2000, at Wentworth, in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the dwelling house of Robyn WARHURST situate at Central Motel, Adams Street, and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, Stealing one Nokia mobile phone in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, he knew that there were persons present within the said Dwelling House.” 
        
       
     18 The charge sheet indicates that the offence was alleged under subs 112(2) of the Crimes Act. Subsection 112(1) contains the general offence of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence and it is unnecessary for present purposes to set it out. It appears that the applicant concedes that he is guilty of an offence under that subsection. Subsection 112(2) is as follows: 
      
       
        
        “Aggravated offence  
        A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.” 
        
       
       
      In order to understand what is meant by the expression “in circumstances of aggravation” one is required to go to s 105A of the Act. It is relevantly as follows: 
       
       
        
        “105A 
         (1) In sections 106-115A: 
        
       
       
        
          
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances involving any one or more of the following: 
        
       
       
       (a)………….. 
        
        (f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The matters referred to in: 
         
        (a) paragraph (c), (d) or (e) of the definition of “circumstances of aggravation”; or 
         
        (b) paragraph (a) of the definition of “circumstances of special aggravation”, 
         
        can occur immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after any of the elements of the offence concerned occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        (2A) For the purposes of paragraph (f) of the definition of “circumstances of aggravation”, if there was a person, or there were persons, in the place in relation to which an offence is alleged to have been committed at the time it was committed, the defendant is presumed to have known that fact unless the defendant satisfies the court that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that there was no one in the place. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The definitions in subsection (1) are not mutually exclusive.” 
        
       
     19 It appears to me that, quite understandably, the applicant does not comprehend the onus placed upon him by subs (2A) once it is proved that there were persons in the house when he entered it. I should add that the applicant’s understanding of the circumstances of aggravation have not been assisted either by the way it was described by the police officer during the record of interview or the way it was described by the solicitor for the Crown before his Honour Judge Coleman. The matter of aggravation is not that there was a person or persons in the house but that the applicant knew that there was a person or persons in the house. In the present case, in order for the applicant to successfully defend the charge alleging the aggravated form of the offence found in subs 112(1), he was required to satisfy the court, on the balance of probabilities, that he had reasonable grounds for believing that there was no one in the premises. Even putting aside the issue of the applicant’s state of intoxication, the applicant would have been met with, what appears to me to be, an insuperable difficulty. 
     20 In his letter to the Registrar the applicant maintains that he had no belief, on reasonable grounds or otherwise, that there was “no one in the place”. The applicant stated: 
      
       
        
        “It was not a premeditated event – I was not aware of the time – I do not know why I chose that particular premises other than that I probably thought it a good idea at the time. It did not occur to me in my confused state to even consider that the place was occupied.” 
        
       
       
      I should note in passing that Mr Doyle states that the applicant told him, when they were discussing the nature of the matter of aggravation alleged before the applicant adhered to his plea in the District Court, that it never entered his head that there was likely to be persons at home. The applicant has never disputed this statement at least. 
       
     21 However, it is not an answer to the circumstance of aggravation alleged that the applicant simply did not give any consideration to whether any person might have been in the premises. If he formed no view about that matter, he cannot satisfy the requirement placed upon him by subsection 112(2A). 
     22 The applicant has relied, both in his letter to the Registrar and in his affidavit, upon his state of intoxication at the time to refute any assertion that the offence was premeditated, that he was aware of the time of day when he entered the premises, or that he was conscious of the nature of the premises that he entered. Presumably the applicant raises these matters in an attempt to rebut the otherwise overwhelming inference that any person, who entered a dwelling house in the circumstances that attended the commission of the offence in the present case, must at least have been aware of the possibility that the premises were occupied at the time. Such an inference would make it virtually impossible for the applicant to convince a court, even on the balance of probabilities, that he had reasonable grounds to believe that no person was in the house. But in my view the evidence of the applicant’s intoxication is irrelevant to the question of whether he was guilty of the offence charged against him. 
     23 An offence under s 112(1) is not an “offence of specific intent” for the purposes of Part 11A of the Act. The offence does not come within the definition of that term in subs 428B(1) nor does it appear in the Table of Offences contained in subs 428B(2). Part 11A is concerned with the issue of intoxication in respect of criminal responsibility. Section 428D is as follows: 
      
       
        
        “In determining whether a person had the mens rea for an offence other than an offence of specific intent, evidence that a person was intoxicated at the time of the relevant conduct: 
         
        (a) if the intoxication was self-induced — cannot be taken into account, or 
         
        (b) if the intoxication was not self-induced — may be taken into account”. 
        
       
       
      There is no suggestion in the present case that the applicant’s state of intoxication was other than “ 
      self-induced intoxication 
      ” as that term is defined in s428A. Therefore, whatever might have been the state of his intoxication, it was irrelevant to the issue of whether he formed any mental element necessary to establish the offence charged and, in particular, as to his state of knowledge or belief as to the presence of any person in the house. 
       
     24 In any event, the applicant’s assertions that he was so heavily intoxicated that he had no real understanding of what he was doing is in my view inconsistent with the objective evidence and his statements to the manager and the police after his arrest, in particular as has been recorded in the record of interview. The only account of the amount of alcohol and drugs he consumed came from the applicant in his evidence before Judge Coleman. However, his Honour did not believe the applicant’s assertions that he had no recollection of why he entered the premises. In light of what is contained in the recorded interview, it is clear that his Honour was quite justified in that opinion. There is no evidence in the statements of the witnesses to suggest that the applicant was as intoxicated as he claims he was. 
     25 It is clear in my view that, whatever be the situation in relation to the instructions given by the applicant to his solicitor, the plea of guilty was appropriate and in accordance with the evidence. In fact it was the only course that was reasonably open to the applicant. This Court will not permit a person to go behind his plea of guilty unless it appears that a miscarriage of justice might have occurred were the appellant to be bound by his plea; R v Lars aka Larsson (1994) 73 A Crim R 91. There is not the slightest suggestion of a miscarriage of justice in the present case: the applicant simply had no defence to the charge either on the material before the District Court and notwithstanding his assertions in his letter to the Registrar or in the affidavit placed before the Court today. The present matter is an application for leave to appeal against sentence but, if the applicant sought to amend the application to an appeal against conviction, leave to do so should be refused. 
     26 I turn then to the applicant’s complaints about the length of the sentence imposed. On the basis that this Court may be required to re-sentence the applicant a letter by the applicant setting out the courses he has undertaken in custody and another setting out his post-release plans has been received with consent of the Crown. However, there is in my view no substance in any of the matters raised that would warrant this Court’s intervention. There is no error in his Honour’s remarks as to the facts or the relevant principles that were to be applied in sentencing the applicant. Nor was the starting sentence of four years that his Honour chose, before giving the applicant the full benefit of a 25 percent discount for his plea, unduly high having regard to the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence, imprisonment for 20 years. As his Honour stated, the offence was a serious one involving as it did entering what was clearly a private dwelling in the early hours of the morning whilst carrying a knife. Even though the weapon was unlikely to cause serious injury to any person it was an aggravating feature of the offence, independent of the aggravating feature which had actually been charged. The facts may have been different had the applicant been confronted by the wife and not the manager. 
     27 Parliament has comparatively recently increased the penalty for offences such as that committed by the applicant by introducing a series of aggravating circumstances which result in a markedly increased maximum penalty. The particular aggravating circumstance, with which the applicant was charged, clearly reflects the concern of the community about persons entering homes whilst the occupants are present, even if they are likely to be asleep at the time. The courts must comply with the legislature’s will and accord appropriate weight to the seriousness of the offence as reflected in the terms of the section and the maximum penalty prescribed. Further, general deterrence is a very significant matter to be reflected in the sentence for such an offence and there was no reason why the present case should not be considered as a suitable vehicle to reflect that particular purpose of punishment. 
     28 True it is that the matter was not in the upper range of seriousness of an offence of its type but the starting sentence considered by his Honour was nowhere near the maximum penalty prescribed. Although regard must be had to the applicant’s behaviour when he was confronted by the manager, that offers little mitigation of the offence charged. It would have been a further, or more serious, offence had the applicant threatened the manager or assaulted him in attempting to escape. There was no mitigation in the fact that the applicant was intoxicated, having regard to the fact that the applicant had a lengthy history of offences of dishonesty committed while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. His record extends back to 1988. I accept that his other appearances had been before a magistrate’s court and it can be accepted that none of his previous offences were as serious as this matter. However, he had been given many opportunities to take stock of himself and address the issues that caused him to abuse alcohol and drugs. Most of the sentences were designed to assist the applicant rather than to punish him. 
     29 Although the applicant had suffered a number of difficulties and events in his personal life that might arouse genuine sympathy for him and explain his reliance upon alcohol and drugs, the applicant’s criminal record required a sentence that would act as a significant personal deterrence against his re-offending. The applicant had twice served gaol sentences in Victoria. At the time of the commission of the offences for which he was before Judge Coleman, the applicant was subject to an intensive correction order and a suspended sentence in that State.  
     30 In my view generally speaking the sentence was well within his Honour’s discretion and there is no basis upon which this Court, could or should, intervene. His Honour found special circumstances but in light of the applicant’s repeated offending, his failure to take the opportunities that had been presented to him in the past and his breach of the sentencing orders outstanding in Victoria, this was a lenient view to take. The applicant complained particularly that the sentence had not been backdated appropriately but it is clear that what his Honour intended to do was to date the overall sentence from the date the applicant went into custody but to commence the sentence for the more serious offence at a time during the sentence imposed for the larceny offence which was a separate and antecedent act of criminality. 
     31 However, there is merit in the applicant’s complaint that he did not seem to receive any significant benefit from his Honour’s finding that there were special circumstances. His Honour made that finding within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in view of the contrition that the applicant had expressed and the intention that he had conveyed to his Honour to try to break away from his old habits. His Honour indicated that he thought that the applicant would benefit from an extended period of supervision. His Honour then said: 
      
       
       “Accordingly, the second sentence will be one of a head sentence of three years with a non parole period of two years.” 
       
     32 In one view the applicant was fortunate that his Honour made a finding of special circumstances in light of the fact the applicant was 29 years of age when he came to be sentenced and might have then been considered a poor chance for rehabilitation, given the opportunities which he had been offered but which he failed to use to change his reliance on alcohol and drugs or his disrespect for other persons’ property. 
     33 However, having found that there were special circumstances his Honour then ought to have put that finding into effect by giving the applicant a proper opportunity to show his attempts at rehabilitation were genuine by a longer period of supervision on parole. It seems to me, with great respect to his Honour, that his Honour’s intention miscarried to some degree because his Honour overlooked that the sentence in respect of which he was making a finding of special circumstances was a sentence which was to be partly cumulative and partly concurrent with another sentence. In the end his Honour proposed a total sentence of three years and three months with a non-parole period of 27 months and a parole period of 12 months. Had his Honour imposed such a head sentence and not found special circumstances, the application of the provisions of the Act would have resulted in a parole period of 9½ months. In fact, as a result of finding special circumstances, his Honour gave the benefit to the applicant of a period of parole extended by a mere 2½ months. I can’t believe that his Honour intended that result and it seems to me, as I have indicated, that his Honour simply made a mathematical error, having overlooked the fact that the sentence was to be partly cumulative on the sentence for the larceny. 
     34 In my view, therefore, the application for leave to appeal should be allowed to the extent that the non-parole period specified by his Honour should be quashed and lieu thereof a non-parole period of 18 months should be specified. I come to that view taking into account the evidence placed by the applicant before this Court as to his further attempts at rehabilitation and his intentions once he is released from custody. It seems to me in those circumstances his Honour also ought to have indicated the applicant was to be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period, not that he was, as his Honour said, “to be considered for release on parole”. The sentence to which the parole period relates is one of three years and therefore by operation of the Act the applicant is entitled to be released at the end of the non-parole period. 
     35 Therefore, the orders that I would propose are that the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal is allowed to the extent that the non-parole period specified in the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal be quashed and in lieu thereof a non-parole period of 18 months be specified to commence on 22 February 2001 and to expire on 21 August 2002, the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. It is to be a condition of his parole that he subject himself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and those provisions which relates to such supervision contained in the Regulations should apply to the parole order. 
     36 STEIN JA: I agree with Justice Howie’s reasons for judgment and with the orders which he proposes. 
     37 HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     38 STEIN JA: Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be as just announced by Justice Howie.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: This is a Crown appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, from a sentence imposed by Judge English in the District Court on Luke Thomas Lord on 24 September 2001.  
      
       
     2 The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated break and enter with intent pursuant to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Her Honour also took into account an associated charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Without proceeding to conviction her Honour ordered the respondent to enter into a conditional bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. 
      
       
     3 Briefly stated the facts are that during the afternoon of 3 May 2001 the respondent, together with a young person, went to the home of a 71 year old woman at Killarney Vale. The young person forced the locked front wire door and he and the respondent entered the house. Both then searched for money or jewellery to steal. The victim then entered the room where they were searching. The offenders grabbed a tapestry carry bag hanging on the door and ran from the room. It is not clear on the material before us or before the trial judge as to which offender grabbed the carry bag. 4 At this point in time the victim was standing in the hallway partially obstructing the exit point. The respondent and the young person forced their way past her in a bid to make good their escape. This caused the victim to fall heavily onto the tiled floor of the hallway and injure herself. Both offenders ran out of the house and decamped.5 The young person was arrested a short time later and identified the respondent as an offender. Police arrested the respondent at his home. At the police station the respondent denied any involvement. Throughout an ERISP interview the respondent continued to maintain his innocence. The interview was suspended for the purpose of an identification parade taking place. While arrangements were being made for this, the respondent made admissions to police. The ERISP then resumed and the respondent admitted that he had entered the house with the young person, but did not fully realise at the time that the young person was committing a break and enter offence. When the victim entered the room he was in, the respondent panicked, and he may have knocked the old woman over as he ran past in order to escape. The respondent denied taking any property from the premises.6 As her Honour noted in her reasons on sentence, statements taken from the young person and the victim greatly differed from the respondent's belated version of the events. So too does the statement taken from Brett O'Heir. His statement suggested that the respondent took a far more active part than he had stated to police.7 The victim suffered a laceration to her right knuckle, swollen knuckles to her left hand, and pain and severe bruising to her lower back. The tapestry bag, and its contents, taken from the premises, have not been recovered. The value of the property was $45. 
      
       
     8 The elderly woman victim suffered from severe osteoporosis and experienced severe pain in her lower back for a lengthy period after the incident. She also suffered from anxiety, sleeplessness and nightmares. 9 Turning from the circumstances of the offence to the subjective features of the respondent. He was born on 7 May 1982 and was 18 years old at the time of the offence, although he turned 19 four days later. He had no prior criminal record although admitted an involvement with drugs. According to the evidence, he has taken steps to rid himself of his drug involvement and has excellent prospects of rehabilitation. The co-offender, who was one day short of 16 years, received a Community Service Order of 100 hours at the Childrens Court. He apparently has a large number of burglary offences to face and was apparently on supervised parole at the time of this offence. The Director of Public Prosecutions accepts that notwithstanding the age difference of three years, the young person was the more serious offender.10 It is unfortunately almost like replaying a long playing record, but it should be recorded that the respondent's parents separated when he was only 4 years old. The respondent then resided with his father until he turned 15 years when he moved from Sydney to live with his mother on the Central Coast. Unfortunately it was here that he fell in with people of bad reputation and started using drugs. Since the commission of the offence he has returned to Sydney to live with his father, obtained work and remained drug free. 
      
       
     11 Of the offender her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         The offender gave evidence before me. He has written a statement expressing his remorse and contrition which I accept as genuine. It is his desire to face his victim and apologise. Unfortunately, she has chosen not to participate in such a conference. He has impressed me as an intelligent and honest young man. The offender is aged 19. He was 18 at the time this offence was committed. 
         
        
       
     12 Her Honour acknowledged that the offences were ‘serious offences indeed’, and that the community and victim would expect that the offender would be placed in custody for a lengthy time. However, she continued: 
      
       
        
         
         In normal circumstances the issues of general and specific deterrence would loom large. Here I find that there was no pre-planning by this offender. He foolishly followed his co-offender who masterminded the offence. That of course does not diminish the criminal responsibility for this offender. I find that the matter contained on the Form 1, whilst itself an objectively serious matter, also lacked any pre-planning. I find that the victim suffered the injuries that she did from the fall which was occasioned not by an intentional assault but by the offender as he made his escape. 
         
        
       
     13 Her Honour then noted that the respondent had no prior criminal record, was addressing his drug problem and had a favourable report from his counsellor. Further, he had returned to his father's home in Sydney and accepted the household discipline. Moreover, he had obtained employment. He had, according to the evidence, excellent prospects of rehabilitation.14 Her Honour then said that there was a place for the exercise of mercy in the circumstances and that a custodial sentence was not called for. She accepted the respondent's remorse and contrition as genuine. Pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, her Honour found the offence proved but did not proceed to conviction, ‘having regard to your age, your good character and what I have found to be the extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences’. She released the respondent on his entering into a 12 months bond to be of good behaviour.15 Section 10(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act sets forth the following factors to which regard is to be had by the Court when considering whether not to proceed to conviction and discharge the offender on a bond. These are: 
      
       
       
       (a) the person's character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
        
        (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
        
        (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
        
        (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider. 
       
     16 Paragraph (a) is obviously relevant in this case. Paragraph (b) is not and there is no manner in which the offence can be seen as trivial. Her Honour purported to apply (c), saying that she had found that there were extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.  17 However, it is not clear that her Honour specified any particular extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. The respondent was not honest with police when arrested and first interviewed. It was not until he realised that he might be identified that he made admissions. Even then he minimised his involvement and, as her Honour properly observed, his version was not consistent with other evidence before the Court. Her Honour does not appear to have made any findings of fact which indicate whether she accepted or rejected the respondent's version of events in whole or part.18 In my opinion, it was an error for her Honour to find there were extenuating circumstances under s 10(3) surrounding the commission of the offence by the respondent. Her Honour did not approach s 10 with the required two step process. Nor did she identify the provision within s 10 to which she had regard. Further, in my opinion, the sentence did not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence or maintain a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the offence. It appears that inadequate weight was given to the objective seriousness of the offence by reason of the offender's subjective features. I accept the Crown's submission that there was no punitive aspect to the sentence and that it contained no relevant personal or general deterrence. 19 Accordingly, it is my view that the appeal must be upheld and the sentence set aside and the Court proceed to re-sentence the respondent. 
      
       
     20 The respondent has tendered some updating evidence as to his personal circumstances. It appears that he has now left his father's home and is in rental accommodation in Sydney. He left his job in October 2001 and worked with a bricklaying firm on a part-time basis and for no pay. The proprietor says that the respondent will commence permanent employment with him in January 2002 as an apprentice brick layer. He will also attend TAFE one day a week and work up to six days a week with Mr Dunn. It is said by Mr Dunn, the employer, that the respondent has been found by him to be a reliable, hard worker and a young man who is motivated and serious about his future. 21 Were it not for the element of double jeopardy that the respondent is exposed to by the Crown appeal and the circumstances which have occurred since the sentencing in respect of which we have evidence, it is my view that some form of custodial sentence is called for. But bearing in mind the circumstances of the Crown appeal, I would not favour a full-time custodial sentence.  
      
       
     22 I also mention that when the matter was first called on today, the Court indicated that it would like to have the benefit of a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service as to the sentencing options, and in particular Community Service. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Probation and Parole Service for tendering to the Court a report in such an expeditious manner. At 2 o'clock we were given the benefit of the report from the Service. The report indicates that the respondent has been assessed as suitable for periodic detention and assessed as suitable for a Community Service Order. The issues which have since been debated is the effect that a Community Service Order and other sentencing options might have on the respondent's work plans in relation to the apprenticeship which he is proposing to commence in January 2002. It was indicated by his counsel that if one was looking at what community service could be carried out by the respondent between now and January 2002, the maximum of 80 hours would be possible. That, of course, did not prevent a longer order of community service being made, which would extend into 2002.23 The Court has to consider all of the circumstances of the appropriate available sentencing options. The options were of course a full time custodial sentence or periodic detention, a suspended sentence conditional upon entering into a bond to be of good behaviour, a s 9 bond and community service. I have already indicated my view that the sentence passed by her Honour utilising s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was a manifestly inadequate one. At first instance it is my view that a custodial sentence at the very least, or periodic detention, would have been the most appropriate taking account of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the situation is different on re-sentencing for the reasons I have already given relating to the double jeopardy that the respondent is placed in and the advances that he has made since the sentencing, and in particular his offer of an apprenticeship in bricklaying from the beginning of 2002.24 In terms of the re-sentencing process and taking into account the objective gravity of the offence, as well as the respondent's subjective circumstances, including his early plea of guilty, and his acknowledged remorse, it is my view that a sentence of 18 months imprisonment is required. However, given the respondent's prior good record, his acknowledged excellent prospects of rehabilitation, together with his youth, this case may in my view be regarded as exceptional and the Court may proceed by way of conviction and a suspended sentence for a period of 18 months. The bond will of course provide the normal conditions including to be of good behaviour. However, I would also include a condition that the respondent place himself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and undertake such Offender Management Group Program as directed by the Service. If the respondent breaches the bond on the suspended sentence, he may be liable to be called upon to be re-sentenced for the offence. Having an 18 months suspended sentence rather than 12 months and no condition is, in my view, preferable for the respondent at a crucial time in his life. The choice is not an easy one but taking into account the elements of double jeopardy and the updating evidence in relation to the personal situation of the respondent, I am of the view that the course which I propose is the course appropriate for the Court to follow.25 Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. I would order that the respondent be convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. I take into account the offence on Form 1. Pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the execution of the sentence is suspended for the term of the sentence and the Court directs that the respondent enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of 18 months subject to the following conditions: 
      
       
       
        1. that he appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time; 
        
        2. to be of good behaviour; 
        
        3. to advise the Registrar of the Court of any change of residential  
        
       address; 
        
        4. that he place himself under the supervision of the Probation and  
        
         
         Parole Service and undertake such Offender Management Group Program as required by the Service. 
         
        
       
     26 HIDDEN J: I agree with the learned Presiding Judge as to the error in her Honour's disposition, and I agree with the orders proposed by the learned presiding Judge.  
      
       
     27 I would add only this. The unusual circumstances of the case were such that I do not think that it was necessarily incumbent upon her Honour to have imposed a custodial sentence to be served full-time or by way of periodic detention. A suspended sentence such as now proposed, in my view, was open to her Honour. This raises the question of double jeopardy in a Crown appeal, quite clearly. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the seriousness of the offence was such that the only other option open, even for this Court on Crown appeal, was to impose a community service order. However, to have imposed an order which would adequately denounce the respondent's crime and recognise the need for deterrence would involve an order of such length that it may have well placed in jeopardy his employment and apprenticeship prospects, which are important for the rehabilitation which he is now undertaking. 28 For those reasons I feel that this Court has no choice but to adopt the course which the learned Presiding Judge has proposed, and I so agree.29 HOWIE J: This is a difficult matter, not because there is any question whether the sentence imposed by her Honour was manifestly inadequate, but what should be the response of this Court to that finding.  
      
       
     30 In my view the offence was of such seriousness that the elements of punishment, including general deterrence and denunciation, had to be reflected in the sentence to be imposed by this Court notwithstanding the rehabilitation of the respondent and the aspect of double jeopardy. While both these latter matters were important, they cannot in my view be allowed to override other aspects of punishment.31 I am of the opinion that her Honour's approach to sentencing the respondent was erroneous for the reasons given by the Presiding Judge. But in any event this is clearly a case where the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate to a very high degree.  
      
       
     32 The only course her Honour could have taken in order to reflect the seriousness of the offence on the one hand, and taking into account the subjective features on the respondent, on the other, was to consider an alternative to a custodial sentence. So too, in my view, even on a successful Crown appeal, this Court must, if it is to interfere, ensure that the seriousness of the criminal conduct is reflected in the sentence to be imposed. 33 The difficulty in this case is to fashion a sentence that reflects, on the one hand, the youth, remorse and attempts at rehabilitation of the respondent but, on the other hand, to impose a sentence which takes into account the objective features of the offences and the other purposes of punishment. This Court was faced with the difficulty of imposing a sentence that would show mercy to the respondent yet denounce his serious criminal activity. An alternative to a full time custodial sentence was proposed, that being community service. Such a sentence had the benefit of fulfilling the requirements of punishment while not interfering with the respondent’s attempts at rehabilitation. However, the only order, which was open to the Court and which the respondent might have reasonably been able to perform, was in my view completely inadequate notwithstanding the special circumstances to be considered in sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. 
      
       
     34 That being the case, the Court was forced to look for some other sentencing option as a suitable alternative to full time custody. I believe that the sentence proposed by the Presiding Judge is the only one that is available. Any other sentence, which the respondent could have hoped to complete without jeopardising his rehabilitation, would be inadequate yet again.  
      
       
     35 I acknowledge that it might well be that for certain offenders a community service order may be viewed as involving more punishment of the offender than a suspended sentence. So too might other alternatives to full time custody such as a sentence of periodic detention. But in the present case the only alternative to a full time gaol sentence by way of an order for community service which the respondent could reasonably perform without either a breach of the order or losing his chance of rehabilitation is not one which was open to the Court to impose while fulfilling its obligations in sentencing the respondent. 
      
       
     36 I therefore agree with the orders proposed by the Presiding Judge.37 STEIN JA: In imposing the orders I did not indicate the date upon which the sentence should commence and expire. In my view the sentence should commence today and expire on 3 June 2003. 38 Accordingly, the orders of the Court are as I have indicated in my reasons for judgment, together with the commencement and expiry date of the sentence.39 HIDDEN J: I agree.40 HOWIE J: I agree.

      R v Bruce Malcolm HARRISON 
       
      R v Konstantinos GEORGIOU 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 GILES JA: The appellants Bruce Malcolm Harrison and Konstantinos Georgiou were tried before Dowd J and a jury on three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The trial occupied many weeks from 2 June 1999 to 22 August 1999. The appellants were found guilty on all counts. They were sentenced on the counts of murder to imprisonment for 33 years commencing on 3 February 1998 as to Mr Georgiou and 9 November 1997 as to Mr Harrison with non parole periods of 28 years, and on the count of attempted murder to imprisonment for 10 years commencing on the same dates. 
      
       
     2 The charges against the appellants related to the shooting of three men, Rick De Stoop, Sasha Milenkovic and Michael Kulakowski, and the wounding of a fourth man, Robin David, in the basement of the Blackmarket Café in Chippindale in Sydney. As can be seen from the length of the trial, the evidence put before the jury was extensive. It included that two guns were used in the shootings, and in such a way that it was open to the jury to find that two persons must have done the shooting in the basement. There was no direct evidence that the persons were the appellants, and the Crown case that they were the appellants was circumstantial.  
      
       
     3 The Crown opened to the jury in the following terms – 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, it is not alleged by the Crown that each of the two accused shot each of the deceased. What is alleged by the Crown is the joint criminal enterprise of these two men in that shooting, which you may well think is an execution style shooting. His Honour will, no doubt, give you directions in relation to joint criminal enterprise and the way the Crown seeks to establish, by the evidence that it has presented by that time, how each of these accused was involved or engaged in a joint criminal enterprise.” 
         
        
        
       
     4 The directions given in relation to joint criminal enterprise were prominent in the appellants’ grounds of appeal, and were the subject of discrete argument. For the reasons which follow, in my opinion the directions were inadequate and the appeals against conviction must therefore be upheld.  
      
       
     5 The directions should be seen in the light of the Crown address.  
      
       
     6 The Crown addressed on 9 and 10 August 1999. The Crown Prosecutor almost immediately launched into the detail of the evidence. After some thirty pages the Crown said that if certain identification and circumstantial evidence were accepted and an alibi of one of the appellants was discounted, then “they both went there on a pre-arranged mission, and that’s able to be ascertained from the evidence”. In context, this meant going to the Blackmarket Café, and some evidence in support of the appellants going to the Blackmarket Café at the material time was then mentioned.  
      
       
     7 A little later in his address the Crown Prosecutor said - 
      
       
        
         
         “So the Crown says from the timing, the two accused being there and having, the Crown says, in their possession the circumstantial evidence, it would establish to your satisfaction their possession of the pistols, the two of them, because the Crown says on the layout of what’s down there, although a small room, although a small room,  
         that it would be fatuous to suggest that one person was doing all the shooting 
         , a two gun man, one against DeStoop, one into Milenkovic and used them both on – no, one, yes – used them one into DeStoop, one into Milenkovic, used them both on Kulakowski and then shot at Robin David.  
         The Crown respectfully submits that you would be satisfied that there were two shooters in that basement at that time. 
         
        
        
         
         So the Crown relies on the seven shots fired. So there’s two shooters. The fact that two of the accused are able to be there, present, have the opportunity to do what is alleged against them, seen running from the premises a short time after, they arrive shortly before the shootings could have taken place and they leave shortly after the shootings could have taken place and did take place, and then there’s the pursuit.  
         So the Crown says they went there with a common design, a common purpose, a joint enterprise, to do what they did. 
         
        
        
         
         And so far as the charge of attempted murder, the Crown has to establish firstly so far as the charge of murder is concerned, the Crown has to establish it was the act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased and it was done with either an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. And the Crown says that you would be satisfied that each of these accused was in the basement at the time with a pistol. Anybody that used the pistol in the fashion that those 9mm pistols was used would have to have an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, that’s really serious bodily injury, and then there’s the charge against them in relation to Mr Robin David. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says that so far as that shot is concerned, anybody who shoots at anybody and hits them in the vicinity of the back of their neck has got to have an intention to kill. Not like trying to blow his kneecap off or his toe or anything like that. It’s shooting at him to either kill him or cause him very serious bodily injury.  
         And the Crown says that that is part of the enterprise. 
          You go to commit the murders, you don’t – it’s an incident of the – or incidental to that arrangement that you are going to want to get away, and if anybody gets in your road or tries to intervene then you will get them out of the way. 
         
        
        
         
         That’s the Crown’s case in relation to the joint enterprise of the accused shooting the man Robin David, and obviously only one shot at Robin David, but they were there carrying out a common design 
          and that was something that must, the Crown says, you would be satisfied with that, the possibility of that incident arising, that is, somebody intervening, must have been considered by each of the accused and it’s on that basis that the Crown mounts the attempted murder charge against the two accused.”  
         (Emhasis added) 
         
        
        
       
     8 This was not entirely clear. It seemed to proffer a case that, quite apart from going to the Blackmarket Café on a pre-arranged mission, both appellants were involved in the shootings of De Stoop, Milenkovic and Kulakowski, but it also referred to going to the Blackmarket Café with a common design and a joint enterprise to do what they did. As to the wounding of David, again there was reference to carrying out a common design, and the wounding appears to have been put to the jury as what has sometimes been referred to as an extended joint enterprise. 
      
       
     9 The summing-up began on 17 August 1999, a week after the Crown’s address. At its commencement the jury was reminded that each charge was to be considered separately in respect of each of the appellants. In the course of that there was mention of a joint criminal enterprise, in the sentence “even if you establish the act of one accused is pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise, that fact, of itself, does not make from [sic: them] both guilty, and if you find one guilty only you must consider the case against each separately”. There was no other explanation at this time of joint criminal enterprise.  
      
       
     10 After directions concerning the way the jury should approach its task the judge began at page 13 of the summing-up with “the process of reminding you of the evidence”. His Honour went through the evidence of the various witnesses in the order in which they had given evidence, summarising in relation to each what had been said. That occupied until page 184 of the summing-up. 
      
       
     11 On 19 August 1999 his Honour turned to “review the arguments put by counsel in their addresses”. He began with the Crown, and in relation to the way the Crown presented its case and in particular joint enterprise said only this - 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown presents the case to you, is a type of identification called recognition. And the circumstantial evidence available concerning pistols, the murder weapon, having been used a fortnight before, in possession of the accused Georgiou, ejection from the Porsche the fact that the both of them are included together, he says if you discount the alibi evidence of Georgiou,  
         the Crown says they went there on a prearranged mission. 
          They were picked up – Harrison was picked up by Georgiou and that in fact the Fischetti phone call he said 12.30 and the call recorded at 12.37 that they are in the car, that they are reaching the area, that you should rely on Maria Ahmed’s evidence and the weapons about the guns going off to the back of her, and that Konz saw the two leaving the bar area and then of course Wraydeh’s evidence and it is about five minutes after she saw Mick Kulakowski, Rick DeStoop and Sasha Milenkovic walk towards the cellar door and asked you to draw the infrence from the picture of the bodies and the Crown asks you to remember Sarah Willemen saying she saw a guy run down the stairs. She heard something and then this other man came across and started kicking the door. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says they can’t prove whether the door was open or not. The Crown relies on seven shots fired, says there are two shooters. The opportunity for the two of the accused to be there. They were seen running from the premises.  
         They went there with a common design, a common purpose, a joint enterprise to do what they did. 
         
        
        
         
         As far as the charge of attempted murder the Crown relies on the – the Crown says it has to establish it was the act of the accused,  
         that is as part of their common purpose of either of them 
          says if you if you would be satisfied that each of the accused was in the basement at the time with a pistol. Anyone who used that pistol in the fashion that the 9mm medium calibre pistols were sued would have to have an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm and that is the charge against Robin David and you only have to look at the evidence of where he was, shot in the head, and the circumstances as evidenced by the mark on the wall where he was shot in the wrist to know that he is an extraordinarily lucky man. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown says that the incident in relation to Robin David arose, something that was intervening and must have been considered by each of the accused and it is on that basis the Crown mounts the attempted murder charge against the two accused.”  
         (Emphasis added) 
         
        
        
       
     12 After dealing with the addresses by counsel for each of the appellants, at page 250 of the summing-up his Honour said he would take the jury through “some of the directions of law that you must take into account”. A few pages later he said that he wished to direct the jury about joint criminal enterprise “because this is the contention of the Crown that both accused were involved in a joint criminal enterprise”.  
      
       
     13 Over the following six pages of the summing-up his Honour gave general directions about the responsibility for the acts of each other of persons carrying out a joint criminal enterprise, including that the Crown must establish both the existence of the joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused and that a joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. His Honour said that the understanding or arrangement need not be express, its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances, and it need not have been reached at any particular time before the crime is committed, and that the circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime. His Honour moved on to refer, still in general terms, to the situation where a crime other than the agreed crime was committed by a party to the joint criminal enterprise. He then returned to deal with participation in a joint criminal enterprise either by committing the crime itself or by intentionally assisting or encouraging another party to the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. A number of examples were give, each quite disparate from the charges before the jury.  
      
       
     14 A little later his Honour came to directions “in relation to the crime of murder”, in the course of which he said that the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt, amongst other things, that in relation to the three charges of murder “it was the accused, as part of their joint enterprise or either of them, who did the act which caused the death of the deceased, Rick De Stoop, Sasha Milenkovic and Michael Kulakowski”.  
      
       
     15 The summing-up ended soon thereafter. His Honour was asked by counsel for the appellant Mr Georgiou to direct the jury that, if the jury were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown had established that there was an understanding or agreement between the appellants to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, then they must acquit. It was said that this was “fundamental to the whole idea of a common purpose”. The Crown agreed. There was then the further direction - 
      
       
        
         
         “Now, the only other direction subject to the final directions that I want to give you is that you, when looking at the offence of murder, and looking at the offence of attempted murder, because the Crown relies on a joint criminal enterprise and that is a common purpose between the two. It is an essential ingredient because of that joint enterprise, in addition to the specific ingredient, if it were just an allegation of murder against one person, that you must find that common purpose and all the ingredients that go with common purpose, you must find that element beyond a reasonable doubt. You must find, in addition to the other matters that I directed you to attempted murder and murder, that it is beyond reasonable doubt that there was a joint criminal enterprise and that the acts were done pursuant to that or acts incidental to that.” 
         
        
        
       
     16 The deficiencies in this, regrettably not overcome by more ample applications by counsel for the appellants or intervention by the Crown, were in my view quite stark.  
      
       
     17 The Crown put the matter to the jury at least in part, if not largely, on the basis that there was pre-concert between the appellants in that they went to the Blackmarket Café with the understanding or arrangement that the three victims would there be murdered, and that the wounding of the fourth victim came about as an incident of that joint enterprise for which they were also criminally responsible. No doubt this course was taken because it might have been that the evidence did not establish to the jury’s satisfaction which of the appellants shot which of the victims or, possibly, that each of the appellants shot one or more of the victims. It was therefore important, as the request for a re-direction acknowledged, that the jury be satisfied as to the pre-concert and that the murders were the subject of the understanding or arrangement. But more was needed. The jury had weeks of evidence before it. General directions about joint criminal enterprise, at the end of some days of summation of the evidence, were inadequate. It was necessary that the jury be assisted as to how the notion of a joint criminal enterprise could apply on the evidence led before it, and on what evidence might be available on which it could find that there had been the necessary understanding or arrangement. It was also necessary that the jury be assisted as to how the notion of joint criminal enterprise was material to their finding of guilt or innocence in a way better than general directions above. 
      
       
     18 In R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 this Court said - 
      
       
        
         
         “A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resumé of the evidence which relates to each of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence:  
         Holford v Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Co Ltd 
          [1909] VLR 497 at 522-523;  
         Mowlds v Fergusson 
          (1939) 40 SR (NSW) 311 at 323; 57 WN (NSW) 20 at 24 and  
         Alford v Magee 
          (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466. This is a rule which appears increasingly to be ignored by trial judges. It is not a compliance with that rule simply to read the relevant part of the section to the jury and then to read out the evidence which has been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, the cross-examination and then re-examination of each witness before turning to the next witness and so on. The idea of a summing-up is to present for the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     19 What happened in this case, at best, was equivalent to the non-compliance to which the Court there referred. The evidence was gone through chronologically, and a general direction as to joint criminal enterprise was given. The relationship between the two, and the relationship between the evidence and the notion of joint criminal enterprise central to the Crown case as presented, were not dealt with. On the contrary, the directions as to joint criminal enterprise and the examples given may well have served to confuse the jury, leaving it to say that it was all very well to have an example concerning, for example, a bank robbery, but what was meant to be the joint criminal enterprise in its case, what was the evidence material to finding it , and in particular what did it mean for finding one of the appellants guilty but not the other or finding them both guilty.  
      
       
     20 The Crown submitted on appeal that the Crown case had been that the joint enterprise need only have commenced at or immediately prior to the shootings, and that it was not necessary to have evidence of a prior understanding or arrangement. It submitted that if the jury was satisfied that the appellants were in the basement together then they must have been acting to achieve the same purpose, namely to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the victims. Perhaps the case could have been put to the jury in that way, and there was at least a hint of it in the Crown’s address. But that made it all the more important to explain the relevance and application of the notion of joint criminal enterprise. To the extent that the Crown case was left to the jury in the manner for which the Crown contended on appeal, there can only have been greater prospect of confusion in that the jury would not know what it was meant to do with that notion.  
      
       
     21 The deficiency in the summing-up is such that in my opinion the convictions can not stand, because the appellants did not have a trial according to law. It is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal.  
      
       
     22 Counsel for the appellant Mr Harrison properly acknowledged that he could not submit that there should be a verdict of acquittal, and that there should be a new trial. Counsel for the appellant Mr Georgiou, to whose position there were other relevant considerations, submitted that there should be a verdict of acquittal.  
      
       
     23 The charges are serious, and in these cases a new trial should be ordered unless the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction or any conviction would inevitably be set aside as unreasonable or unsupportable. The contrary was not submitted. On behalf of Mr Georgiou it was submitted that there was effectively no independent evidence of a prior understanding or arrangement, and that so far as one might have been found from the presence of the two appellants in the basement there was insufficient evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Georgiou was in the basement at the time of the shootings. The most direct evidence suggesting that Mr Georgiou was in the basement, that of Miss Konz, was said to be unreliable for a number of reasons, but it was said that even if it were accepted it could not lead beyond reasonable doubt to the conclusion that Mr Georgiou was in the basement.  
      
       
     24 I do not think that pays sufficient regard either to the evidence of Miss Konz or to the evidence as a whole. There was evidence of prior possession by Mr Georgiou of the two guns used in the shootings. There was sound evidence that Mr Harrison had been in the basement, particularly through DNA from one of the victims and a gunshot wound which Mr Harrison had incurred, and the evidence of Miss Konz had Mr Harrison and Mr Georgiou running from the direction of the door to the basement out of the Blackmarket Café with Mr Harrison holding a gun and apparently covering the back of Mr Giorgiou. There were descriptions of two men who then drove away at high speed in Mr Georgiou’s car. One was undoubtedly Mr Harrison, because he was later found in the car. From the descriptions, it could be found that the other was Mr Georgiou. The two guns, recalling that they were guns shown to have been in the prior possession of Mr Georgiou, were thrown from the car as it drove away. There was evidence concerning telephone calls which assisted to place Mr Georgiou in the vicinity of the Blackmarket Café at the time of the shootings. There was evidence of flight by Mr Giorgiou capable of affording evidence of consciousness of guilt.  
      
       
     25 Approaching the matter on the basis outlined by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, in my view it was open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Giorgiou was guilty.  
      
       
     26 I propose the following orders in each of the appeals – 
      
       
       (1) Appeal allowed. 
        
       (2) Conviction and sentence quashed. 
        
       (3) Order that there be a new trial. 
        
       
     27 SULLY J: I entirely agree. 
      
       
     28 GREG JAMES J: As I do also.

      ADRIAN RICHARD WALMSLEY v ANTONIO COSENTINO 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Powell JA. 
      
       
     2 POWELL JA: This is an appeal from a judgment delivered by Garling DCJ on 30 August 2000, on which day his Honour found a verdict in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant in the sum of $474,478 in proceedings which the Respondent had brought to recover from the Appellant damages in respect of what was claimed to be the Appellant’s “professional negligence”.  
      
       
     3 The origin of the proceedings was the injuries which the Respondent sustained in a motor vehicle accident in which he was involved on 13 August 1980. On that day the Respondent, who was then just 25 years of age and who was then a self-employed contract tiler by occupation, was driving his utility in a southerly direction along the Princes Highway near Lacey Street, Kogarah when a Mrs Upton, who had been driving her motor vehicle in a northerly direction along Princes Highway, commenced to make a right hand turn from Princes Highway into Lacey Street. As she did so, the left, or near, side portion of Mrs Upton’s motor vehicle collided with the right, or off side, front portion of Mr Cosentino’s utility. After the collision, Mrs Upton’s motor vehicle travelled a further 20 metres and collided with an electric light pole in Lacey Street. At the time of the collision, which appears to have been in the evening, it was dark, the street lights were on, light rain was falling and the road surface was wet. The police traffic report (Exhibit Part B blue AB 385) indicated that it was proposed that Mrs Upton be “breached” for “not make right hand turn with safety”. 
      
       
     4 It was the Respondent’s case at trial that, as a result of the collision, he sustained injuries to his shoulder and his cervical spine, the sequelae of latter injury being such as significantly to impair his ability to continue to work as a contract tiler. 
      
       
     5 The Respondent who, at the time of the collision, had been living in Dural, appears later to have moved to live in Andrew Thompson Drive McGraths Hill near Windsor High School. In February 1981, or thereabouts, the Respondent retained the Appellant, a solicitor then carrying on practice in premises in George Street Windsor, to act for him in connection with a claim to recover damages in respect of the injuries sustained by him in the collision. Given the date of the collision, it was open to the Respondent to commence proceedings against Mrs Upton to recover damages at any time up to 12 August 1986.  
      
       
     6 It would seem that, having received his instructions, the Appellant sought medical reports from Dr Griffiths, the Respondent’s general practitioner and Dr McGrath, an orthopaedic surgeon to whom the Respondent had been referred. At the same time, requests were made with a view to obtaining the Police traffic report and evidence as to the registration of Mrs Upton’s motor vehicle and, as well, the Respondent was asked to let the Appellant have an amount on account of disbursements.  
      
       
     7 On 11 August, 1981 the Appellant wrote to the Government Insurance Office, which was apparently the compulsory third party insurer of Mrs Upton’s motor vehicle, forwarding a copy of the police traffic accident report, certificates under s 36 of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1942 and the Motor Traffic Act 1909 together with a copy of the report which had been obtained in the mean time from Dr McGrath. 
      
       
     8 Following the receipt from the Government Insurance Office of a request for particulars dated 8 September 1981, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent asking him to communicate with him (the Appellant) in order that he might obtain particulars as to the Respondent’s income at the time of the accident as well as particulars of his loss since the accident and likely future economic loss. Nothing apparently having been heard from the Respondent in the mean time, the Appellant again wrote to him in January 1982 again asking the Respondent to communicate with him.  
      
       
     9 Thereafter, matters progressed in what can only be described as a dilatory way, delays being sustained in respect of obtaining information from the Respondent himself, from the Respondent’s accountants and from the Respondent’s medical advisors, those delays continuing until well into 1984. In the course of his evidence at trial, the Respondent appeared to suggest that, to the extent to which such delays could be attributed to apparent dilatoriness on his part, the delays on his part were due to the fact that he was, at the time, involved in protracted and bitter litigation in the Family Court following the break up of his marriage in 1982, a suggestion which seems difficult to accept, since the Appellant acted for him in connection with those proceedings in the Family Court.  
      
       
     10 Despite the delays which had occurred, and which were to continue, the Appellant did not, at any time prior to August 1986, inform the Respondent of the period within which proceedings on his behalf needed to be commenced if they were not to be time barred. 
      
       
     11 Eventually, in August 1984, the Appellant wrote to the Government Insurance Office forwarding particulars of the out of pocket medical expenses incurred by the Respondent, enclosing copies of the reports which had been obtained from Dr McGrath, Dr Griffiths and a Dr Bosanquet, who had carried out manipulation of the Respondent’s spine in 1984 and, as well, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Respondent’s accountant together with copies of what were said to be relevant tax returns filed on behalf of the Respondents. That letter produced an offer of settlement in the sum of $16,000, comprising $500 for out of pocket expenses, $4,500 for economic loss, $1,500 for legal fees and $9,500 for general damages. Despite the fact of that offer having been made being conveyed to the Respondent in November 1984 with a request that it be considered by the Respondent and his instructions given in respect of it, no such instructions appear to have been given prior to August 1985, when the Government Insurance Office wrote to the Appellant advising that, if no response to the offer were forthcoming instructions to withdraw the offer would be sought. That letter produced a letter from the Appellant forwarding an up to date medical report and further copies of income tax returns which had been lodged on behalf of the Respondent, but no counter offer was made on behalf of the Respondent. That letter concluded (blue AB 128):- 
      
       
        
         
         “We are mutually aware that this matter has now been on foot for some five years and that it is we who have been unable to provide you with final information. This has been on the basis that the doctors remain unable to the present time to provide us with a firm prognosis. Nevertheless, our experience in these matters would indicate that it is hardly likely that our client will recover as his situation has hardly improved over the last five years. As a result, if you are not prepared to contemplate a continuing economic loss over a substantial period of time, it will be necessary for us to proceed with proceedings without further delay. In this regard, would you advise whether or not you are prepared to agree to the proceedings taking place in the District Court on an unlimited jurisdiction basis.” 
         
        
       
     12 According to a brief which was delivered to Mr P J Phelan in March 1987, shortly before his elevation to the bench of the District Court, (Blue AB 88-89):- 
      
       
        
         
         “A further letter was forwarded to the Government Insurance Office on 27 August 1985 and on 3 January, 1986 we were requested to propose a counter offer.  
         
        
        
         
         Certain information was obtained, also advice from Peter A Gooden and Co, Accountants, and Mr Cosentino was written to on 17 February 1986. Information requested from our client was slow in coming forth and certain discussions took place with him to enable the matter to be submitted to the Government Insurance Office but this information was not able to be submitted prior to August, 1986 and it was felt that proceedings should be commenced, this was done and the statement of claim was served on 7th January, 1987. A defence was subsequently filed.” 
         
        
       
       
       (A draft of that Statement of Claim appears to have been forwarded to counsel to be settled on 8 October 1986 – that is, after the limitation period had expired – and, after it had been settled, was forwarded by the Appellant to his law stationers on 19 December 1986 for filing in the Supreme Court; despite the statement from the brief which I have set out above as to the date of service of the Statement of Claim, a diary note from the Appellant’s file (Blue AB 104) seems to indicate that, as at 14 January 1987, the Statement of Claim had not been served).  
        
       
     13 A Statement of Defence, in which it was pleaded that the proceedings were statute barred (see Blue AB 117) was forwarded to the Appellant by the Government Insurance Office on 4 February 1987.  
      
       
     14 Thereafter, on 10 February 1987, the Appellant wrote to the Government Insurance Office requesting that the Defence be withdrawn and the proceedings allowed to continue “in the normal manner”. In that letter, the Appellant sought an urgent reply “as, in view of the plea put on by (the Government Insurance Office), the Appellant felt that any other short delay would probably used by (the Government Insurance Office) in opposing any application (the Appellant) would make for an extension of time (an application which, incidentally, (the Appellant) felt would be more than justified in the circumstances of the negotiations, (the Respondent’s) medical condition and the circumstances of (the) matter”. 
      
       
     15 The brief to Mr. P J Phelan, to which I have earlier referred, was one of two briefs delivered to him in March 1987, the first such brief being delivered on 19 March and the second on 20 March. The nature of the first of those briefs is certainly revealed by the following paragraph from it (Blue AB 91):- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Government Insurance Office was subsequently written to on 10 February 1987 and no reply has been received to that letter although there have been certain telephone conversations with their officers who have indicated they are prepared to continue to negotiate the matter but it is felt that in view of the defence that has been put on any amount that they would be likely to offer by way of settlement would not be acceptable to our client due to his continuing disability and loss of income. 
         
        
        
         
         Counsel is requested to advise as to whether, in his opinion, an application for an extension of time is likely to succeed and as to any further or other steps which could be taken in the interests of our client  
         and ourselves 
          and, if appropriate to draft any application and advise as to any supporting affidavits or evidence that may be required, bearing in mind the continued negotiations between the Government Insurance Office and ourselves to arrive at a settlement”.  
         (My emphasis) 
         
        
       
       
       In the second of those two briefs (Blue AB 83) Mr Phelan was asked to advise  
       “as to his thoughts on quantum in connection with (the) matter”. 
        
       
     16 In his Memorandum of Advice dated 16 April 1987, Mr Phelan, when dealing with the question of a possible application for an extension of time, after referring to the provisions of ss 57, 58 of the Limitation Act 1969 (“the Act”) wrote:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Regrettably, in the circumstances, I come to the conclusion that the provisions of the Limitation Act do not assist the client – and indirectly my Instructing Solicitor. Facts known were the occurrence of negligence, the identity of the person causing the negligence, and the fact that damages and injury arose, the nature and extent of that injury. Appropriate advice has been taken from one qualified and experienced in the law.  
         
        
        
         
         As a result of that advice, of course, my Instructing Solicitor is at risk with respect to a negligence suit. It may be that under my Instructing Solicitor’s policy of indemnity insurance there are clauses which necessitate disclosure to the insurer when once a risk is observed. My only advice to my Solicitor at this point of time would be to examine the clauses of his contract of insurance to see whether there are any obligations flowing from such contract, the breach of which might lead to a denial by the insurance company to indemnify my Instructing Solicitor. 
         
        
        
         
         However, not all is lost at this particular point of time, and in spite of the Statute of Limitations I understand that the GIO is quite willing to keep up the discussions with respect to settlement and have gone on albeit intermittently over the years.” 
         
        
       
     17 When, later in his Memorandum of Advice, Mr Phelan came to deal with the question of the likely quantum of damages to which the Respondent might be entitled, he commented upon the paucity of the materials which had been provided to him, particularly with regard to such matters as hospital and medical expenses, past and future economic loss and even the question of non-economic loss. However, in regard to the question of non-economic loss, he observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “I would therefore see the range of general damages as lying between $20,000 and $30,000 depending upon what the final medical evidence is supposed to be. Interest on that range amounts to a further sum of $4,000 to $6,000. 
         
        
        
         
         …………… 
         
        
        
         
         I am sorry to be so imprecise but the material before me does not allow greater precision than that which is expressed above.” 
         
        
       
     18 There was a meeting between the Respondent and the Appellant on 27 April 1987. Of that meeting the Respondent and the Appellant gave differing versions of what was said and done. In the course of his judgment (RAB 26-28) Garling DCJ dealt with the competing versions and resolved them in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is only one real area of dispute. There is said to be a meeting on or about 27 April 1987 between the plaintiff and the defendant. At this time the limitation period for the motor vehicle accident claim had expired. Mr Walmsley, the defendant, said that he had a meeting with the plaintiff. He had received advice from Mr Phelan of counsel, gave it to the plaintiff who appeared to read it, and he told the plaintiff he would have to sue him. The advice refers to the claim being out of time and gives the solicitor advice in relation to two differing matters. One relates to the quantum of the claim and the other some advice to the solicitor.  
         
        
        
         
         The defendant said that he did not tell the plaintiff that he should get separate representation. He agrees he should have. He said he remembers this meeting and what happened after reading a letter which is exhibited and is dated 28 April 1987 and after reading the advice. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff could not remember seeing Mr Phelan’s advice. The plaintiff said at no time did Mr Walmsley tell him that he had to bring proceedings within a six year time period. Mr Walmsley agrees. He agrees he did not tell the plaintiff there was a six year time limit. The plaintiff says at the end he was told he would have to put in a claim against the solicitor. He did not think that meant going to court. The solicitor said he was covered by Law Cover for any claim. The plaintiff said that had he been told he would have gone to see another solicitor. 
         
        
        
         
         Both the plaintiff and the defendant were good witnesses who did their best to give accurate and truthful evidence. The problem in this case is the time lapse. In relation to the conversation on 27 August (sic) 1987 I prefer the plaintiff’s version that he did not seek (sic) the advice of Mr Phelan.  
         
        
        
         
         Mr Walmsley said his memory came from a reading of a letter and the advice and from reading that concluded that he must have shown it to the plaintiff. However, a close reading of the letter does not reveal that. It refers to the advice Mr Phelan in relation to damages. It is just as consistent that verbal advice as often happens between a solicitor and their client was given, that is, the solicitor advised his client of the advice given by Mr Phelan without asking his client to actually read that advice. It appears to me from the letter that what he gave advice on was the quantum of the claim. He passed that information on to the plaintiff and so the plaintiff I believe did not ever see the written advice as he says. I prefer the memory of the plaintiff in this case. He was very involved in the case. He has good reason to remember it. When the solicitor, being very frank, says that his memory comes from a reading of the letter and as I have said I do not believe that is sufficient to have refreshed his memory to the extent he thinks it has.” 
         
        
       
     19 The letter to which Garling DCJ referred was as follows (Blue AB 91):- 
      
       
        
         
         “Re: YOUR ACCIDENT 
         
        
        
         
         We refer to our conference with you on 27th inst and note that you were to consider the advice given by Mr Phelan in connection with this matter as to the amount of damages that you might reasonably expect to receive.  
         
        
        
         
         We should be glad if you would consider the advice and let us have your further instructions and comments in connection with the matter at your earliest convenience.” 
         
        
       
     20 In his judgment (RAB 28) Garling DCJ continued:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I must say that the solicitor, Mr Walmsley, was very frank when he gave his evidence. He personally did not back away from his liability. Mr Walmsley, said that he was acting for the plaintiff, attempting to negotiate a settlement with the GIO. He acted for the plaintiff in a number of matters and indeed continued to act for the plaintiff in a number of matters until quite recently. He said they were quite friendly. Mr Walmsley says that he simply forgot to issue or to file the statement of claim. A short time later realised it was out of time. He hoped to be able to settle the case as the GIO had a policy of still negotiating even where the limitation period had expired, if there had been active negotiations underway at the time it expired. He had referred the matter to Mr Phelan and kept trying to negotiate a settlement. There was at one stage an offer of settlement of $16,000, but both the plaintiff and the defendant in this case agreed it was not enough. There was some difficulty in getting accurate wage records from the plaintiff. The matter just seemed to drift on then for a further five years or so.” 
         
        
       
     21 Although it is difficult to determine exactly what happened over the course of that period of five years or so, such materials as are before the court would seem to confirm that the Government Insurance Office did, at the time, have a practice of continuing negotiations after the expiration of a limitation period. Thus, on 29 April 1987 (Blue AB 77), the Government Insurance Office requested particulars of the Respondent’s employment history from 1 July 1979 to date, and, after, on June 12, 1987 the Appellant had forwarded to the Government Insurance Office certain information, arrangements were made for the Respondent to be examined by doctors retained on behalf of the Government Insurance Office. The materials which are before the Court do not reveal what, if anything, happened in the following year or so.  
      
       
     22 It would seem, however, that, notwithstanding the increasing delays, the Appellant still retained some hope that, in some way, an extension of time could be obtained by him on behalf of the Respondent. That this was so is indicated by the fact that, in November 1988 (Blue AB 62), another member of the bar was asked to advise whether there was any prospect of an extension of time being obtained, the advice obtained, on that occasion, being that counsel was obliged to agree with the advice of Mr Phelan (Blue AB 44).  
      
       
     23 Undeterred, the Appellant, in December 1988, delivered a brief (blue AB 59-61) to another member of the bar to advise, counsel’s advice, given in March 1989 (Blue AB 52-53), on this occasion being:- 
      
       
        
         
         “There is a basis for pleading a reply to the GIO’s defence by alleging confirmation but there are obvious omissions of documents in the brief and the possible omission of further documents which cover a crucial negotiating period in 1984 and could allow an extention (sic) of limitation to enable this statement of claim to fall within time. 
         
        
        
         
         I shall be glad to discuss this file with you in its entirety if you have some time to spare in the city at a mutually convenient time. In the mean time, I should advise you to notify your insurers of a possible claim. 
         
        
        
         
         From my recollection the terms of your policy would not allow you to file a reply to their defence without placing your indemnity in jeopardy. However, in presenting your claim to the insurer I have no doubt it would be of considerable assistance to them if you proposed the above defence and supported it with the necessary documents on which it could be pleaded.” 
         
        
       
     24 After a further delay of some two and a half years during which, so far as the materials which are before the Court reveal, nothing happened, (Blue AB 34-37) a brief was delivered to yet another member of the bar to advise. That brief concluded (Blue AB 37):- 
      
       
        
         
         “Accordingly, he has advised us that he simply wishes to resolve the claim and will be happy to get whatever he can. He further indicated that anything over $20,000.00 would be regarded by him as being more than acceptable. 
         
        
        
         
         It seems to the writer that we are in a position where the GIO offered $16,000.00 some 7 years ago and that it may not be impossible, with the appropriate approach, for this figure to be negotiated up. Needless to say, the writer feels extremely negative about contacting the GIO after this period of time and particularly in the circumstances surrounding the statutory defence. We should perhaps add that our client previously thought that his claim was worth well in excess of $100,000.00. 
         
        
        
         
         The situation concerning notification of our insurer remains unchanged and no such notice has been given. We appreciate the ramifications of this. 
         
        
        
         
         We should be most grateful if Counsel would consider the possibility of an approach being made to the GIO with a view to resolving this matter by further negotiation and we look forward to hearing from him in this regard.” 
         
        
       
     25 Although it seems (Black AB 111) that counsel might, at an earlier stage, have given some informal advice, his formal advice had not been received, nor had the Appellant previously advised the Director of Law Cover of what it was which he intended to tell the Respondent when, on 8 January 1992, there was a meeting between the Respondent and the Appellant at which time, according to the Appellant’s evidence, (Black AB 112):- 
      
       
        
         
         “At the end of the discussion Mr Cosentino said various things to me including that he did not wish to instruct another solicitor: – 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘I do not want to instruct another solicitor at this stage. I have been dealing with you for a long time. I want you to pursue that application if its worthwhile. If the worst happens and its not, or it fails, what do I do?’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And I said “Then you’ll have to sue me”.  
         
        
        
         
         And he said “Well you’ve got insurance I guess?”  
         
        
        
         
         And I said “yes”.” 
         
        
       
       
       The Appellant admits that he did not, at that time, inform the Respondent that any proceedings against him by the Respondent, either for breach of retainer or for negligence, would need to be commenced before mid August 1992 if they were not, in their turn, to become time barred.  
        
       
     26 Following the discussion between the Respondent and the Appellant, the Appellant, on 8 January 1992, prepared, and had the Respondent sign, a letter which was in the following terms (Blue AB 30):- 
      
       
        
         
         “RE: MY ACCIDENT ON 13 AUGUST 1980 
         
        
        
         
         I refer to my meeting with you today in connection with this matter. I note your advice to me that the proceedings on my behalf for damages in respect of the injuries I sustained in this accident were commenced by you out of time having been filed on 12 December, 1986. I appreciate your advice that the solicitor for the Government Insurance Office has filed a defence to my claim which relies partly on the Statute of Limitations as the accident was commenced more than 6 years after the accident. 
         
        
        
         
         I also note that you have advised me as to my instructing another solicitor to now act on my behalf. I do not wish to do this at this time. 
         
        
        
         
         Accordingly, I instruct you to proceed with the matter with all necessary expedition to both hearing and also for any leave that might be necessary for this action to be brought out of time.” 
         
        
       
     27 In December 1992, counsel, who had been retained in September 1991, but who had, in the mean time, been provided with a copy of the letter signed by the Respondent in January 1992, delivered a Memorandum of Advice (Blue AB 17-22) in which he advised, first, of his agreement with the advice tendered by Mr Phelan as long ago as 1987, and also, of his view that any application to obtain an extension of time would be futile. Counsel attached to his Memorandum of Advice a draft letter to the Government Insurance Office in a final attempt to achieve some satisfactory outcome for the Respondent. 
      
       
     28 That advice appears to have led the Appellant to write to the Director of Law Cover forwarding a copy of counsel’s advice and the draft letter and seeking approval for that letter being forwarded to the Government Insurance Office. The Appellant’s letter led to a reply (Blue AB 11-12) approving of the letter being sent. 
      
       
     29 On 29 January 1993 (Blue AB 7) the Government Insurance Office broke off negotiations. 
      
       
     30 On 12 February 1993, the Director of Law Cover, having been advised of that fact (Blue AB 6) wrote, to the Appellant (Blue AB 5) (inter alia) as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “You are correct in noting it is necessary to advise your client that it will be necessary for him to instruct another solicitor to pursue his rights.  
         
        
        
         
         Kindly keep me informed in the event that there are any further developments in the matter.” 
         
        
       
     31 On 15 February 1993, the Appellant wrote to the Respondent as follows (Blue AB 3-4):- 
      
       
        
         
         “RE YOUR ACCIDENT ON 13 AUGUST 1980 
         
        
        
         
         We refer to our conversations with you in connection with this matter late in 1992 and now confirm our advice to you that the GIO has defended the proceedings instituted by us on your behalf by relying on the ground that such proceedings when not commenced within 6 years from the date of the accident and are, as a consequence, statute barred. 
         
        
        
         
         We further confirm that we have received various advices over the years to the affect that this defence will not succeed, but that there have recently been some High Court decisions which indicate to us that the defence is more likely to succeed than fail. In the event that that were to happen on the hearing of this matter, this means that you would loose (sic) the case and could be liable to GIO for costs. Clearly, that is a most undesirable situation and one which can not be acceptable to you. 
         
        
        
         
         After speaking with you in connection with the matter, we notified our insurer of the situation in respect of your claim and, with its concurrents (sic) wrote one more letter to the GIO in an endeavour to settle this matter for a reasonable amount. We have recently received a letter from them which declines taking the matter any further.  
         
        
        
         
         Accordingly, we sincerely regret to advise that there is nothing further that we are able to do to assist you. In the event that you wish to pursue the matter further with a view to recovering a verdict, it will be necessary for you to instruct another solicitor so that he can best advise you as to what should now be done. 
         
        
        
         
         We appreciate that you have displayed a marked reluctance in the past to seek independent advice and we thank you sincerely for the loyalty that you have shown the writer in this regard. We understand that you have probably not had dealings with any other solicitors since the time you have first known the writer and that you may well have an aversion to consulting with a stranger in this matter. However, we have taken the liberty of discussing it with George Rhodes, Solicitor of 3 Baker, Windsor, telephone (045) 77-3640 and he is happy to assist you. Mr Rhodes is well known to your sister in law Anna and is a solicitor who is experienced in litigation matters. Would you please advise of your wishes in this matter at your earliest convenience.” 
         
        
       
     32 Since, at one stage, Mr Rhodes was joined as a party defendant to the proceedings at first instance (AB 1 – see also Blue AB 544-545), it is clear enough that, following receipt of this letter, the Respondent retained Mr Rhodes to act for him as is it also clear enough that, while so acting, Mr Rhodes retained yet another member of the bar to advise in the matter. 
      
       
     33 The Respondent’s present firm of solicitors appears to have been retained at some time prior to May 1994, on which day there was filed in the 1986 proceedings, a Notice of Motion (Blue AB 546) seeking an order:- 
      
       
        
         
         “1. That the limitation period in respect of the cause of action pleaded in the Statement of Claim filed herein on 22 December 1986 be extended up to an including 22 December 1986.” 
         
        
       
     34 That Notice of Motion, on the hearing of which counsel for the Respondent sought to argue that the letters from the Government Insurance Office to the Appellant dated 17 December 1984 (see para 10 above) and the later letter of 2 August 1985 (see para 10 above) constituted “confirmations” for the purposes of s 54 (2) of the Limitation Act 1969, came before Master Greenwood who, on 1 July 1994, delivered a judgment (Blue AB 547-549) dismissing the motion with costs and, as well, dismissed the proceedings with costs.  
      
       
     35 The proceedings at first instance were commenced in the Supreme Court on 23 December 1994 when there was filed the Statement of Claim to which I have earlier referred. 
      
       
     36 The Defence which was originally filed on behalf of the Appellant contained the following (inter alia) (RAB 6):- 
      
       
        
         
         “6. The first defendant admits that he failed to commence legal proceedings to recover damages for personal injury in a motor vehicle accident on 13 August 1980 within the time fixed by the statute of limitations but denies that he was negligent. 
         
        
        
         
         7. The first defendant denies that he breached his contractual obligation to the plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         …………… 
         
        
        
         
         9. The first defendant denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the damages claimed. 
         
        
        
         
         10. The first defendant says that if he was negligent as alleged, which is denied, the plaintiff contributed to his own loss. 
         
        
        
         
         Particulars of contributory negligence 
         
        
        
         
         (a) failure to provide information as requested; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) failure to provide instructions; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) failure to respond to correspondence from the first defendant.  
         
        
        
         
         11. The first defendant says that any claim against him is barred by the provisions of the Limitation Act, the time for bringing such a claim as having expired on 13 August 1992.” 
         
        
       
     37 At first there was filed on behalf of the Respondent a reply (RAB 9) which, so far as is relevant, was as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “In answer to paragraph 11 of the First Defendant’s Notice of Grounds of Defence the Plaintiff says that the First Defendant fraudulently and/or deceitfully concealed from the Plaintiff the existence of a cause of action which was maintainable by the Plaintiff against the First Defendant.” 
         
        
       
     38 Later, there was filed on behalf of the Respondent an Amended Statement of Claim (RAB 12-15) which, so far as is relevant, was as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
         “1. At all material times the Plaintiff was a client of the First Defendant and Second Defendants (sic) who were solicitors and who undertook to act for him and to render to him legal advice. 
         
        
        
         
         ……. 
         
        
        
         
         3. It was agreed between the Plaintiff and the First and Second Defendants that in consideration of the Plaintiff becoming their client and paying fees when called upon to so do the First and Second Defendants would act on behalf of the Plaintiff and render to him legal advice. 
         
        
        
         
         …… 
         
        
        
         
         6. The First Defendant was so negligent in the carrying out of his instructions on behalf of the Plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Failing to issue a Statement of Claim within the 6 year period expiring 13 August 1986. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Not issuing a Statement of Claim prior to 13 August 1986. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Delay in taking proceedings on behalf of the Plaintiff thus aggravating the effects of his injuries and disabilities. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Failing to advise the Plaintiff that in respect of his clause of action against Amelia Upton and/or the GIO, proceedings were required to be instituted within 6 years of the date of the motor vehicle accident otherwise there was a likelihood that they would be defeated by a plea by the GIO pursuant to the Limitation Act. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Failing to advise the Plaintiff that he had a cause of action against the First Defendant for negligence in failing to institute proceedings against Amelia Upton and/or the GIO. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Failing to advise the Plaintiff that should he wish to sue the First Defendant for negligence he needed to institute these proceedings no later than 12 August 1992. 
         
        
        
         
         (f)(sic) Failing to advise the Plaintiff that he needed to obtain independent legal advice. 
         
        
        
         
         7. In the alternative the First Defendant breached his contractual obligations to the Plaintiff. 
         
        
        
         
         PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE 
         
        
        
         
         See particulars of negligence above.” 
         
        
       
     39 The Defence to that Amended Statement of Claim, which was filed on behalf of the Appellant, was, relevantly, as follows (RAB 16-17):- 
      
       
        
         
         “The first defendant admits that he failed to commence legal proceedings to recover damages for personal injury in a motor vehicle accident on 13 August 1980 within the time fixed by the Statute of Limitations and failed to advise the plaintiff that, in respect of the cause of action against Amelia Upton and/or the GIO, proceedings were required to be instituted within six years of the date of the motor vehicle accident, but otherwise denies the allegation. 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Admitted. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Admitted. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The first defendant admits that he failed to commence legal proceedings to recover damages for personal injury in a motor vehicle accident on 13 August 1980 within the time fixed by the statute of limitations, but otherwise denies the allegation. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) The first defendant admits that he failed to advise the plaintiff that in respect of the cause of action against Amelia Upton and/or GIO, proceedings were required to be instituted within 6 years of the date of the motor vehicle accident otherwise there was a likelihood that they would be defeated by a plea by the GIO pursuant to the Limitation Act but otherwise denies the allegation. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Denied. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Admitted, except that the first defendant denies the existence of such a duty. 
         
        
        
         
         (g)(sic)Admitted, except that the first defendant does not admit the existence of such a duty. 
         
        
        
         
         ………… 
         
        
        
         
         11. The first defendant denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the damages claimed.  
         
        
        
         
         12. The first defendant says that any claim against him is barred by the provisions of the Limitation Act, the time for bringing such a claim having expired on 13 August 1992. 
         
        
        
         
         13. In relation to the whole of the claim, the first defendant says that by no later than 8 January 1992 he had discharged his duty to advise the plaintiff that he may have a cause of action against the first defendant, and that the plaintiff needed to obtain independent legal advice (if a duty to give such advice exists, which is not admitted). 
         
        
        
         
         14. Further, in relation to the whole of the claim, any damage which was suffered by the plaintiff after 8 January 1992 (which is not admitted) was caused by the plaintiff’s failure to obtain independent legal advice.” 
         
        
       
     40 Whether, before the hearing before Garling DCJ, the Respondent discontinued the proceedings against the other parties defendants who had originally been joined, it is the fact that, on that hearing, the Respondent sought relief only against the Appellant. 
      
       
     41 When, in the course of his judgment, Garling DCJ came to consider the question of liability he wrote (inter alia) as follows (RAB 30):- 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff argues that the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care. Part of that duty of care is to advise the plaintiff that the limitation period in the 1990 (sic) action had expired and that the plaintiff should obtain independent legal advice and that the defendant had a duty to cease to act as he had a conflict of interest. It is not hard to see the conflict of interest and indeed the defendant readily admitted it. All one has to do is turn to that letter I recently referred to about settlement and you can see the huge conflict that was involved. Once the limitation period expired the defendant, in my view, should have done each of those matters I set out above. In fairness he should have declined to further act for the plaintiff as no matter what his good intentions may have been he did always have a conflict, that is, he obviously wanted to see the matter settle and to do the best he could for the plaintiff, but he was doing it with one hand tied behind his back, that is with the knowledge that he could never have commenced an action in a third party matter as it was statute barred.” 
         
        
       
       
       and, later (RAB 31-32), after referring to what was said by Deane J in  
       Hawkins v Clayton ( 
       (1987-1988) 164 CLR 539, 590):-  
        
        
         
         “In this case it is argued that the limitation period does not run whilst the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant exists. The defendant does not advise the plaintiff that the claim against the GIO is statute barred and that he had to bring action against the solicitor and he had to bring that action by way of a Court case within six years of the other action being statute barred. 
         
        
        
         
         It is agreed by the defendant that the plaintiff was never told he had to bring it within six years. 
         
        
        
         
         The defendant on the other hand argues that the limitation period has indeed expired and there is nothing the plaintiff can do about it. The defendant argues that the time begins to run in the cause of action for negligence when the cause of action is complete. It is completed when damage occurs. They rely upon a number of cases including Daundoulakis v Anthony Solrinis and Company (1989) VR 773 at 785 where the Court found that the cause of action against the solicitor for negligently failing to institute proceedings on behalf of his client within the limitation period is complete when the relevant limitation period for bringing the client’s cause of action expires.” 
         
        
        
       and, later again (32-34):- 
        
        
         
         “The plaintiff says in reply that each of those decisions differ from this one in that in this one the solicitor continued to act for the plaintiff. The solicitor did not cease to act, advise the plaintiff that he was out of time or advised the plaintiff of the limitation periods and they can be easily distinguished from those other cases. 
         
        
        
         
         Having considered these matters and the lengthy submissions made, I have concluded that in this case the time did not commence to run, certainly not before the end of 1994 and probably not after that. I am satisfied that the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff to advise the plaintiff firstly that the period of limitation for bringing the case against the GIO had expired. Secondly, that the only way there could be a proper outcome was for the plaintiff to bring proceedings against the solicitor. That the solicitor should have ceased to act. The plaintiff should have been advised to get independent legal advice. The solicitor should have made it quite clear to the plaintiff that he had to bring a claim in a Court and that there was a limitation period of six years. He did none of that he simply continued to act for the plaintiff and I agree with the plaintiff’s argument that the limitation period was not running and that the plaintiff issued these proceedings within the limitation period. There can be no dispute that the defendant was negligent. There is only one other matter I need to deal with and that is the amended reply. That reply in effect relies on section 55 of the Limitation Act 1969 and relies on fraud, deceit, concealment. The principles are set out in  
         Seymour v. Seymour 
          (1996) 40 NSWLR at 585 in which the Court said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘That it must generally involve a consciousness that what is being done is wrong or that to take advantage in a relevant situation involves wrongdoing.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Justice Mahoney said he: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… would regard as a misuse of language and unsound to apply the statutory expression fraudulently in section 55 to any conduct which did not involve some form of dishonesty or moral turpitude.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         Having considered this matter I do not believe it falls within the class of actions which are contemplated by section 55. What happened in this matter was that a solicitor had got a matter out of time and then tried to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion. In doing so I do not believe that those matters which are set out in section 55 of the Limitation Act become applicable and I would not have found for the plaintiff on the basis of the reply.” 
         
        
       
     42 In the event, as I have earlier recorded, Garling DCJ found a verdict for the Respondent in the sum of $474,478.00 and ordered the Appellant to pay the Respondent’s costs and directed the entry of judgment accordingly. 
      
       
     43 In the Notice of Appeal (RAB 40-51) which was filed on behalf of the Appellant, the following grounds of appeal were taken: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour erred in holding that time did not commence to run for bringing proceedings against the Appellant before the end of 1994. 
         
        
        
         
         2. His Honour erred in holding that the Appellant did not advise the Respondent that the period of limitation for bringing the case against the GIO had expired. 
         
        
        
         
         3. His Honour erred in holding that the Appellant did not advise the Respondent that he (the Respondent) would have to sue the Appellant. 
         
        
        
         
         4. His Honour erred in holding that the Appellant did not advise the Respondent to obtain independent legal advice. 
         
        
        
         
         5. His Honour erred in holding that the Respondent issued the present proceedings within the limitation period. 
         
        
        
         
         6. His Honour erred in applying the dictum of Deane J in  
         Hawkins v. Clayton 
          (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 590. 
         
        
        
         
         7. His Honour erred in awarding damages for distress. 
         
        
        
         
         8. His Honour erred in failing to discover (sic) the damages for future economic loss by 15% for vicissitudes.” 
         
        
       
       
       (Ground 8 was not pressed on the hearing of the appeal (T.21)). 
        
       
     44 It seems to me that there are, essentially, four questions which fall for determination by this Court, they being: 
      
       
       
       (a) when did a cause of action for breach of contract or in negligence for failure to commence proceedings against Mrs. Upton accrue to the Respondent; 
        
        
       (b) when, if at all, did that cause of action become statute barred, a question involving a consideration of: 
        
        
         
         (i) the exception to the general rule suggested by Deane J in  
         Hawkins v. Clayton 
          ((supra) at 590); and 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) the provisions of s.55 of the Limitation Act 1969; 
         
        
        
       (c) whether, notwithstanding the fact that, in January 1992, the Appellant informed the Respondent of his right to commence proceedings against him, the facts, first, that the Appellant did not then inform the Respondent of the time limit within which any such action should be brought and, second, that the Appellant continued to act for him until February 1993, that is, some 12½ years after the motor vehicle accident, gave rise to a further cause of action, or to further causes of action, in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant; and 
        
        
       (d) whether, assuming that the Respondent had a cause of action against the Appellant which had not become statute barred, it was open to Garling DCJ to make an award of damages for vexation. 
        
        
       The general rule 
        
       
     45 As a general rule, a relevant limitation period commences to run when the cause of action in relation to which it is said to apply is complete. When that cause of action is one based on negligence, in which case damages are of the essence of the cause of action, the cause of action is not complete until the plaintiff suffers actual damage caused by the defendant’s breach of duty. 
      
       
     46 An action for damages against a solicitor, where the defendant is said negligently to have failed to commence proceedings for a claim for personal injury within the statutory period, is a claim for damages for loss of a chance to recover damages for those personal injuries, it following that in such a case the plaintiff sustains loss and, thus, his cause of action accrues when the action becomes statute barred (Doundoulakis v. Antony Sdrinis & Co. [1989] VR 781; Registrar General v. Cleaver (1996) 41 NSWLR 713; Sampson v. Zucker (Court of Appeal, 11 December 1996 (unreported)); Scarcella v. Lettice [2000] NSWCA 289; Cheney & Wilson v. Duncan [2001] NSWCA 197). Subject, therefore, to the relevance of the exception suggested by Deane J to the general rule and of the provisions of s.55 of the Limitation Act 1969, it follows that, on 13 August 1986, a cause of action against the Appellant accrued to the Respondent.  
      
       
       
       The exception suggested by Deane J. 
        
       
     47 The exception to the general rule which has been suggested by Deane J in Hawkins v. Clayton is to be found in the following passage from his Honour’s Judgment (supra at 590): 
      
       
        
         
         “If a wrongful action or breach of duty by one person not only causes unlawful injury to another but, while its effect remains, effectively precludes that other from bringing proceedings to recover the damage to which he is entitled, that other person in doubly injured. There can be no acceptable or even sensible justification of a law which provides that to sustain the second injury will preclude recovery of damages for the first. It would, e.g, be a travesty of justice and common sense if the law provided that a cause of action lay for damages for false imprisonment but then went on to provide that that cause of action would be lost if the false imprisonment continued for six years after the cause of action first accrued. Likewise, it would be a travesty of justice and common sense if the law imposed a duty upon a solicitor to take positive steps to inform a third person of the contents of a document of which the solicitor was alone aware and then provided that any cause of action against the solicitor for damage caused by a negligent failure to perform that duty would be lost if the negligence continued for six years. It is arguable that the notion of unconscionable reliance upon the provisions of a Statute of Limitations which provides the foundation of the long established equitable jurisdiction to grant relief in a case of concealment of a cause of action until after the limitation period has expired (cf. s.55(1) of the Limitation Act) should, by analogy, be extended to cover cases such as these where the wrongful act at the one time inflicts the injury, and while its effect remains, precludes the bringing of an action for damages. It seems to me, however, that the preferable approach is to recognise that it could not have been the legislative intent that the effect of provisions such as s.14(1) of the Limitation Act should be that a cause of action for a wrongful act should be barred by lapse of time during a period in which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the bringing of proceedings. On that approach, the reference in s.14(1) of the Act to the cause of action first accruing, should be construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the institution of proceedings.” 
         
        
       
     48 The status to be accorded to the exception suggested by Deane J is, to say the least, unclear, if only because although in Hawkins v. Clayton each of Brennan J and Gaudron J concurred in the order proposed by his Honour, neither agreed with the basis upon which his Honour founded his Judgment, and each of them proceeded upon the basis that no cause of action accrued to Mr. Hawkins until he assumed the office of executor. 
      
       
     49 But even if one assumes that the exception suggested by Deane J is to be regarded as part of the law of Australia, it does not seem to me that that would avail the Respondent in the present case. It was always open to the Respondent, if he were dissatisfied with the apparent lack of progress on the part of the Appellant in processing his claim, to terminate the Appellant’s instructions, to seek advice from other solicitors, and to retain them to commence, and to prosecute, proceedings on his behalf. Further, it is clear that, by no later than 8 January 1992, the Appellant had informed the Respondent of his failure to commence proceedings within time and of the fact that the Government Insurance Office had filed a defence to the proceedings which had in fact been commenced on the Respondent’s behalf, which defence relied in part on the provisions of the Limitation Act 1969 and had advised the Respondent to instruct another solicitor to act on his behalf, a course of action which, if it had been adopted by the Respondent, would have enabled proceedings to have been commenced against the Appellant before 13 August 1992. 
      
       
       
       Limitation Act 1969 s.55 
        
       
     50 So far as is relevant, s.55 of the Limitation Act 1969 provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “55(1) Subject to subsection (3) where: 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         (b) a cause of action or the identity of a person against whom a cause of action lies is fraudulently concealed, 
         
        
        
         
         the time which elapses after a limitation period fixed by or under this Act for the cause of action commences to run and before the date on which a person having (either solely or with other persons) the cause of action first discovers, or may with reasonable diligence discover, the fraud, deceit or concealment, as the case may be, does not count in the reckoning of the limitation period for an action on the cause of action by him or by a person claiming through him against a person answerable for the fraud, deceit or concealment. 
         
        
        
         
          (2) Subsection (1) has effect whether the limitation period for the cause of action would, but for this section, expire before or after the date mentioned in that subsection. 
         
        
        
         
          (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person is answerable for fraud, conceit or concealment if, but only if: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) he is a party to the fraud, deceit or concealment. 
         
        
        
         
         …” 
         
        
       
     51 In Seymour v. Seymour (1996) 40 NSWLR 358, to which Garling DCJ referred in the course of his Judgment, Mahoney ACJ wrote (supra (at 372)): 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, the section is not confined to simply common law fraud. It extends to conduct beyond that. On the other hand, it is not, I think, sufficient merely that for the defendant to take advantage of the statute of limitations would be unconscionable or inequitable in the wide sense of these terms. Terms such as unconscionable and inequitable now are used to describe conduct which, in previous times, would not have fallen within them: see  
         Baumgartner v. Baumgartner 
          (1987) 164 CLR 137 at 147 and  
         Hibberson v. George 
          (1989) 12 Fam LR 725 at 731.  
         
        
        
         
         Nor, in my opinion, is ‘fraudulently’ wide enough to include everything which would fall within the description of ‘equitable fraud’. Equitable fraud is a doctrine which depends, for this purpose, too much upon nice distinctions which have been drawn in other times: see Snell’s Equity, 29th ed (1990) at 550 et seq; Meagher Gummow & Lehane, Equity: Doctrines and Remedies, 3rd ed (1992) at par 1208; and see the discussion in  
         Logue v. Shoalhaven Shire Council 
          [1979] 1 NSWLR 537 at 553. The history of the English legislation was recently reviewed in  
         Sheldon v. RHM Outhwaite (Underwriting Agencies)  
         [1996] 1 AC 102: see eg, at 144, 153. 
         
        
        
         
         In my opinion, there must be in what is involved a consciousness that what is being done is wrong or that to take advantage of the situation involves wrongdoing. At least, this is so in the generality of cases. (There is in this as in many things the problems of dealing with the person who ‘closes his eyes to wrong’ or is so lacking in conscience that he is not conscious of his own lack of proper standards.)” 
         
        
       
     52 In the light of his findings as to the Appellant’s motivations, Garling DCJ was, in my view, correct to find that, in the circumstances, the Respondent was not entitled to rely on the provisions of s.55 of the Limitation Act 1969. 
      
       
       
       An additional cause of action or additional causes of action 
        
       
     53 This question arises because of the inclusion in the Amended Ordinary Statement of Claim, as additional particulars of negligence of para. 6(f) (sic) which were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “(f) Failing to advise the plaintiff that should he wish to sue the first defendant for negligence, he needed to institute these proceedings no later than 12 August 1992. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Failing to advise the plaintiff that he needed to obtain independent legal advice.” 
         
        
       
       
       in respect of the first of which the Appellant in the grounds of defence to the Amended Statement of Claim admitted the fact, while denying the existence of a duty, and in respect of the second of which the Appellant, while admitting the fact, did not admit the existence of such a duty. 
        
       
     54 In seeking to deny that the matters asserted – and admitted – in those paragraphs constituted a breach of duty on the part of the Appellant, Mr. D.L. Davies SC, who appeared for the Appellant, drew the Court’s attention to the recent decision of the High Court in Astley v. Austrust Limited (1998-1999) 197 CLR 1 and, in particular, to that part of the Judgment of Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ where their Honours’ wrote (supra (at 23)): 
      
       
        
         
         “The theoretical foundations for actions in tort and contract are quite separate. Long before the imperial march of modern negligence law began, contracts of service carried an implied term that they would be performed with reasonable care and skill. Persons who give consideration for the provision of services expect that those services will be provided with due care and skill. Reliance on an implied term giving effect to that expectation should not be defeated by the recognition of a parallel and concurrent obligation of the law of negligence. The evolution of the law of negligence has broadened the responsibility of professional persons and requires them to take reasonable care and skill even in situations where a contractual relationship cannot be established. But given the differing requirements and advantages of each cause of action, there is no justification in recognising the tortious duty to the exclusion of the contractual duty.” 
         
        
       
       
       as a basis for submitting that the ambit of the duty of care can be no higher than the duty provided for in the contract of retainer and, semble, that, as the contract of retainer related to the bringing of proceedings against Mr. Upton, there could be no duty to advise the Respondent in respect of his rights against the Appellant. 
        
       
     55 Even if one is to assume that the contract of retainer between the Respondent and the Appellant was as Mr. Davies appears to have suggested, it does not follow that an additional duty of care on the part of the Appellant towards the Respondent could not exist given the relationship between them. It is quite clear that duties may be owed by solicitors in a situation in which no contractual relationship exists. Hawkins v. Clayton (supra) was such a case, as also was Hill v. Van Erp ((1996-1997) 188 CLR 159) (see also, Waimond Pty. Ltd. v. Byrne (1989) 18 NSWLR 642; Curnuck v. Nitschke [2001] NSWCA 176, paras. 8 et seq per Davies AJA, 38 et seq per Fitzgerald AJA). 
      
       
     56 In the circumstances, it seems to me that, in failing to advise the Respondent in January 1992 that, if he were to commence proceedings against him, those proceedings would need to be commenced by mid-August 1992, in default of which they in their turn would become time barred, the Appellant failed in the duty to which, by reason of the relationship between himself and the Respondent he was subject. 
      
       
       
       Damages for vexation 
        
       
     57 In his Judgment (RAB 39), Garling DCJ dealt with this aspect of the Respondent’s claim as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is a claim for damages for distress pursuant to the principles in  
         Baltic Shipping v. Dillon 
           
         (1976) CLR. The plaintiff gave evidence of some distress. The plaintiff clearly would have suffered some distress. It was not a huge matter. It was a matter for which the plaintiff should be compensated and I allow the sum of $5,000.00.” 
         
        
       
     58 In the Written Submissions which were filed on behalf of the Appellant, the matter was dealt with in the following way (Orange AB 12): 
      
       
        
         
         “19. Damages for distress are not recoverable in the present case. Damages for disappointment and distress are not recoverable unless they proceed from physical inconvenience caused by breach of contract or unless the contract is one the object of which is to provide enjoyment, relaxation or freedom from molestation (Mason CJ with whom Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, in  
         Baltic Shipping Company v. Dillon 
          (1993) 176 CLR 344 at 365 and see also McHugh J at 405).  
         
        
        
         
         20. There is little authority in relation to claims against solicitors. The English Court of Appeal in one such case ( 
         Hayes v. Dodd 
          [1990] 2 All ER 815) appears to have adopted a similar rule to that in  
         Dillon 
          and held that damages for distress were not recoverable where the solicitor was retained to convey a commercial property.” 
         
        
       
     59 Even if – which may be doubted (see, for example Heywood v. Wellers  [1976] QB 446, Farley v. Skinner [2001] 3 WLR 899) - the right to include - in a claim for damages for breach of contract – a claim for damages for vexation is to be limited in the way suggested in the Judgments in the High Court in Baltic Shipping Company v. Dillon (supra), it does not follow that that right is so circumscribed when a claim is made for damages in tort. In Avenhouse v. Hornsby Shire Council (1998) 44 NSWLR 1) Sheller JA, with whom Mason P and Priestley JA agreed, wrote (supra (at 37-38): 
      
       
        
         
         “The right to recover damages for non-material injury is shortly and usefully discussed in Fleming, Law of Torts 9th Ed (1998) Law Book Co at 285 where the learned author said: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘It used to be thought that damages for non-material injury were allowed only consequential on the physical injury but not damage to property, such for example as grief over the death of a cat or distress and inconvenience over damage to one’s home or car. But there has lately been a change: damages for foreseeable worry and anxiety, or physical inconvenience are now being awarded in cases of negligently constructed homes, even business premises, and at least for intentional shooting of pets. Equally in cases of purely economic loss, such as resulting from conversion and misrepresentation.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         For damages to be recoverable the vexation must be related to the tortious act or omission complained of, not to the ensuing litigation or the ordinary commercial, professional or private incidents of the complainant’s life. Reference was made to the New Zealand Court of Appeal in  
         Mouat v. Clark Boyce 
          [1992] 2 NZLR 559 at 569 where Cooke P remarked that there are many tort, contract or statutory status cases in New Zealand in which foreseeable distress has been an ingredient in the award and (at 573) where Richardson J said:  
         
        
        
         
          
           
           ‘… there are numerous recent cases in which moderate awards have been made in respect of discomfort and inconvenience and associated anxiety and distress sustained by plaintiffs where damage to buildings has occurred due to carelessness on the part of local body building inspectors.’ 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         This appeal in the New Zealand Court of Appeal was from a decision at first instance on a retrial previously ordered by the Court of Appeal when upholding an appeal from an earlier trial. Subsequently, this previous decision of the Court of Appeal was reversed by the Privy Council:  
         Clark Boyce Mouat 
           
         [1994] 1 AC 428, however, this does not seem to me to affect the authority of the later Court of Appeal decision which attracted no comment or mention in the Privy Council, on the question with which we are here concerned.” 
         
        
       
       
       Then, following a reference to the decisions of this Court in  
       Brickhill v. Cooke 
        [1984] 3 NSWLR 396 and  
       Campbelltown City Council v. Mackay 
        (1989) 15 NSWLR 501, Sheller J continued (supra (at 39)): 
        
        
         
         “Damages for such non pecuniary loss, irrecoverable if claimed alone, may be added if the plaintiff has suffered and the defendant is liable for pecuniary loss.” 
         
        
        
       In the present case, the Appellant has been held liable for pecuniary loss – the loss of a chance to sue Mrs. Upton – and his distress at the delays incurred in the loss of his right to sue Mrs. Upton was, I would have thought, reasonably foreseeable. 
        
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
     60 For these reasons I conclude that the attacks which have been made upon the Judgment of Garling DCJ on the part of the Appellant have all failed, it following, in my view, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
      
       
     61 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Powell JA.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Barr J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge that in 1980 he had carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of 10 and 16 years, namely of 12 or 13 years. He was committed to the District Court for sentence and there adhered to his plea. Coleman DCJ QC convicted the applicant and ordered him to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for 12 months.2 The circumstances are unusual. During 1980 the applicant was 14 or 15 years old. One day he and a boy about one year senior to him were in the country town where they lived. They had a car. With them were the complainant, who was then 12 or 13 years old, and another girl. The car stopped in a quiet place. The elder boy and the other girl got out of the car, leaving the applicant and the complainant alone. The applicant locked the doors. The complainant lay on the back seat. The applicant removed her lower garments and had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her. Then the elder boy returned to the car, got into the back seat and had intercourse with the complainant. The complainant told her mother soon afterwards but her mother decided not to report the matter to the police. A few days later the applicant went to the complainant's house and said that he was sorry for what he had done. There the matter was left. 
      
       
     3 On 22 October 1998, 18 years later, the complainant's husband found out what had happened. The other offender was still living in the same town and the complainant's husband arrested him and took him to the police station. On 29 September 1999, almost another year later, police interviewed that man.  
      
       
     4 More than a further year later, on 10 October 2000, police interviewed the applicant. He made full admissions of everything he was able to remember about the incident. Only then was he charged.  
      
       
     5 All the evidence before his Honour established that the applicant was, apart from the blemish that took place when he was 14 or 15 years old, a person of excellent character. He was in regular employment and a valuable man to his employer. He was married and had two growing children. He had strong family support. A pre-sentence report contained the following passage: - 
      
       
        
       "" 
       Discussion with Senior Psychologist: 
        After a discussion with the Senior Psychologist, Regional Supervisor (Sex Offenders' Programmes) from the Department of Correct Services, a risk assessment was conducted using a STATIC-99 as the actuarial risk assessment instrument. On the basis of this instrument Mr Schlenert's risk of sexually reoffending falls in the low risk category.""  
        
        
       
     6 The meaning of that paragraph is unclear. The nature of the instrument called the STATIC-99 is obscure. What actuarial risk assessment has to do with the chances that a person might commit a sexual offence I do not understand. I would have thought that the paragraph would have to be taken as meaning that there was no risk that the applicant would commit a sexual offence and I think that his Honour must have so understood it. 
      
       
     7 In deciding to record a conviction and require the applicant to enter into the bond his Honour rejected the option under s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act not to convict him but to dismiss the charge or discharge the applicant on condition that he enter a good behaviour bond. A number of attacks were made upon his Honour's reasoning in coming to that decision. The first submission was that his Honour erred in finding that the delay in complaining to the authorities was not a factor to be taken into account in favour of the applicant. His Honour said this: - 
      
       
        
       ""The fact that (the offences) occurred so long ago does not minimise the seriousness of the offences, nor does the fact that it took so long for the complainant to bring the matter to the attention of the police, benefit either of the offenders.""  
        
        
       
     8 There will be many cases where delay in complaint cannot assist an offender. For example, a complainant put in fear by the activities of an offender, especially as a child, may be rendered incapable of reporting an offence for many years. Offenders cannot take advantage on sentence of delays of that kind but there is no universal rule that delay may not work to the benefit of an offender on sentence. Each case has to be considered according to its own facts and circumstances: R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534. 
      
       
     9 The gross delay in bringing this matter to the notice of the authorities was in no way attributable to anything about the relationship between the applicant and the complainant or to anything done by the applicant. In my opinion his Honour erred in allowing the applicant no benefit on account of that delay. I think that the applicant was entitled because of it to be treated more leniently.  
      
       
     10 The delay made it particularly important for the authorities to deal with the matter without further delay, yet it was two more years before the applicant was charged. It seems to me that that was a further factor that his Honour ought to have taken into account in favour of the applicant: R v Aliperti [2000] NSWCCA 315.  
      
       
     11 The offence was strikingly stale. That was a matter that his Honour was obliged to take into account: R v DJS [2001] NSWCCA 189. 
      
       
     12 It is not necessary to deal with the remaining grounds of appeal. I think that this Court should intervene.  
      
       
     13 The applicant is not a risk to the community. Over many years he has worked to establish a responsible position in his family, work and social life. He is well regarded. He ought not now to lose the regard of his family, friends and peers because of the resurrection of a boyhood offence. In my opinion the community has no interest in seeing the applicant further stigmatised: R v DJS. 
      
       
     14 I propose the following orders:  (1) Grant leave to appeal. (2) Allow the appeal and quash the orders made by his Honour.  (3) Without proceeding to conviction, order pursuant to s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the charge be dismissed.15 ADAMS J: I agree. 
      
       
     16 BARR J: The orders of the Court therefore are as I have proposed.

     R v Debbie Marie Adams 
      
      
     Judgment 
      
    1 His Honour: The offender was born on 11 August 1982. On 25 January 1999, at the age of 16, she stabbed her mother with a knife causing serious injury. The offender was taken into custody on 26 January 1999 and was detained at the Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre, where she attended the Sunning Hill School within the centre precincts. On 23 July 1999, when not yet 17 years of age, she stabbed a teacher with a knife during a cooking class at the school, killing him. 
    2 The offender was found unfit to be tried. She is of low intelligence and suffers from a severe personality disorder. At a special hearing conducted before me without a jury, I found, pursuant to s19(1) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (hereafter “the Act”), that, on the limited evidence available the offender committed the offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in relation to the first episode, and the offence of manslaughter in relation to the second episode. Those findings were made in a judgment delivered by me on 12 September 2001. I directed the entry of verdicts accordingly. The verdicts constitute a qualified finding of guilt and do not constitute a basis in law for a conviction: the Act, s22(3). 
    3 The finding of manslaughter in relation to the second episode was made pursuant to s23A of the Crimes Act 1900. The offender was charged with murder, but I found that the offender’s capacity to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from the personality disorder. I reduced what would otherwise have been a finding of murder to manslaughter on that account. 
    4 The scheme of the Act is then as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        23(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment; and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as “a limiting term”, in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (2) . . . . . 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (3) . . . . .  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court, after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        24(1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal; and 
          
         (b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (2) If a Court refers a person to the Tribunal, the Tribunal must determine whether or not: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the person is suffering from mental illness; or 
          
         (b) the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and, where the person is not in a hospital, whether or not the person objects to being detained in a hospital. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (3) The Tribunal must notify the Court which referred the person to it of its determination with respect to the person. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        27 If a Court is notified by the Mental Health Review Tribunal of its determination in respect of a person under section 24(3), the Court may: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is suffering from mental illness or that the person is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person, not being in a hospital, does not object to being detained in a hospital – order that the person be taken to and detained in a hospital; or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is not suffering from mental illness or from a mental condition referred to in paragraph (a) or that the person is suffering from such a mental condition but that the person objects to being detained in a hospital – order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital. 
         
        
       
      
    5 As a matter of convenience, there was no sharp division between the special hearing in this case and the next phase in the proceedings. Following my judgment, given on 12 September 2001, counsel sought an opportunity to supplement the submissions received at an earlier stage. That occurred on 19 October 2001, when I reserved my decision concerning the matters remaining to be decided. 
    6 The function of a limiting term is to limit the period for which a person unfit to be tried can be detained for the offence or offences the subject of the special hearing: Mitchell (1999) 108 A Crim R 85 at [30]. In that connection, the scheme of the legislation cured the previous situation, where persons who were unfit to be tried were detained indefinitely without a court determination as to whether an offence had been committed. On expiry of the limiting term, the offender is released, unless detained as a continued treatment patient pursuant to s89 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (because of mental illness or disability, and there being no other means of dealing with the person).  
    7 The over-arching principle in fixing a limiting term is that it must be the best estimate of the sentence the court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence or offences and the person had been found guilty of the offence or offences: the Act, s23(1). I am, therefore, to make a determination having regard to the objective gravity of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the offender having regard to the range of considerations which would be taken into account after conviction at an ordinary trial. The considerations include the offender’s mental state at the time of the offences and since. 
    8 Any matter of aggravation must be found beyond reasonable doubt. Any matter of mitigation may be found on a balance of probabilities. 
    9 The objective features of the two offences are recorded in my judgment of 12 September 2001. The first offence was premeditated. The offender had been in care from the age of four following sexual abuse, and was later abused while in care. The offender blamed her mother for her mistreatment. She went in search of her with a knife, and stabbed her with the intention of causing her serious harm.  
    10 The same cannot be said of the second offence. Although the intention to cause at least serious harm was inescapable, the act was done on impulse, with no planning, without provocation and with no discernable motive. 
    11 As to the offender’s mental state, Dr Westmore described her personality disorder as “extreme” and “severe”, and her consequent behavioural disturbances as “extreme”. Behavioural disturbances included “her impulsivity, her lack of judgment, her lack of boundaries, the uncontained aggression”. Dr Wilcox and Dr Brown agreed with Dr Westmore’s diagnosis. I accept that evidence. It is reviewed in detail in my judgment of 12 September 2001. 
    12 As found in my judgment of 12 September 2001, the offender had a pathological fascination for knives and other sharp objects. There was a history of incidents involving violence and the threat of violence. The offender had limited capacity to control her behaviour in this respect. On the day of the homicide, as found in my earlier judgment, the offender was in a highly aroused state, initiated by access to and handling of a knife or knives. Her tendency to violent behaviour, the availability of a knife, her highly aroused state and her inability to control her impulses combined to produce the tragic consequence. 
    13 Dr Brown is a visiting medical officer, attached to Mulawa Correctional Centre, Silverwater. Her other professional appointments include clinical lecturer in psychiatry at the University of Sydney and Royal North Shore Hospital. She has been the offender’s treating psychiatrist since July 1999, that is, since shortly after the offender’s major offence. I have mentioned her opinion concerning the offender’s mental state. In recent months, there had been some calming effect from prescribed medication. Prison staff were supportive in maintaining access to treatment for her. 
    14 Dr Brown was seeing the offender every month or two. In private practice, Dr Brown said, the offender would be seen on a weekly basis. Dr Brown also said she would prefer the offender to be accommodated in a secure facility with hospital staff, but no such facility exists for women prisoners in this state. Accommodation in the general prison population had not been considered as a reasonable possibility.  
    15 Whether the offender would ever overcome her aggressive, impulsive tendencies was uncertain. According to Dr Brown, that could occur with maturity, in her late twenties or thirties. The prospect was, however, reduced by not being able to provide the offender with intensive psychotherapy due to the limited resources available in the prison system. 
    16 The opinion of the three psychiatrists who gave evidence was unanimous that, in her current mental state, the offender posed a serious threat to herself and to others, and that secure confinement with close supervision was required. 
    17 Evidence was also given by Ms N Jess, a senior correctional officer, stationed at Mulawa. She had been the offender’s case officer since the offender’s transfer to Mulawa in July 1999. She saw her daily and reviewed her status monthly. 
    18 When first transferred to Mulawa, in July 1999, the offender was accommodated in the Mum Shirl Unit for about a year. She was then transferred to the segregation section of the Multi-Purpose Unit, which was staffed 24 hours a day. Freedom of movement within that section was more restricted than in other parts of the gaol. The offender was confined to her cell from 5 pm to 8 am and from 12 noon to 2 pm. That was some three and a half hours per day longer than for inmates in the general prison population. 
    19 The Mum Shirl Unit is for psychiatric inmates. The offender attended the Unit for educational and recreational activities, including music lessons and pottery, Monday to Friday, and sports activity on Sundays. The offender also attended group therapy sessions there, conducted by a staff psychologist, and periodic one to one sessions with the psychologist. The offender was allowed contact with the main gaol population in the Sacred Garden at the prison. She had been assisted greatly by having a mentor from the main gaol population who visited her daily. The offender assisted in the wing laundry and did some grounds maintenance under supervision. She had contact with a special needs teacher who was addressing literacy and numeracy.  
    20 The offender had goals: to be housed in the main population of the gaol and to work with the main gaol population. Although the offender’s aggressive behaviour had diminished in incidence and severity over the time she had been at Mulawa, Ms Jess did not suggest that such goals were likely to be achieved in the foreseeable future. 
    21 The considerations relevant to the exercise of the Court’s discretion in sentencing an offender were stated in Veen v The Queen (No.2) 164 CLR 465 (at 476) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        [S]entencing is not a purely logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. Purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. 
        
       
      
    22 The balancing exercise is nowhere more acute than in cases where mental disorder or mental disability has contributed to the crime. On the one hand, the discouragement of others by example, that is, general deterrence, is generally regarded as deserving less weight in such a case because it is considered inappropriate to use such a person in that way: Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, 86; Letteri (NSWCCA, 18 March 1992, unreported). On the other hand, whilst protection of the community cannot justify a sentence that is disproportionate to the gravity of the crime: Veen (No.2) at 472 ff, that consideration may be of greater importance in the case of a mentally disturbed offender: Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, 68 and 71, and may offset the offender’s mental condition which would otherwise be a potentially mitigating feature of the case: Garforth (NSWCCA, 23 May 1994, unreported) at 11-12; Street (NSWCCA, 17 December 1996, unreported) at 35-37. 
    23 There is no persuasive evidence of the offender having felt remorse for either crime. That, no doubt, is a function of her mental disorder and of her intellectual disability. The absence of remorse does not count against her, but remorse is not available as a mitigating consideration. 
    24 To my mind, the predominant considerations in this case are, on the one hand, retribution for wilful injury and then for taking a human life; and, on the other hand, the very low level of moral culpability involved in either offence by reason of the offender’s mental state. I also take into account, in mitigation, the offender’s youth and the harsh conditions under which she is kept. 
    25 I mention, in passing, that it is no part of my function to determine what responsibility others have or might have for the conditions which contributed to the homicide. 
    26 I have read the victim impact statement, written by Mr Bremner’s father on his own behalf and on behalf of the deceased’s family. They have suffered a terrible loss which nothing the court can do would repair. I am precluded by law from taking into account the effect of Mr Bremner’s death on them, when fixing a limiting term in this case. I understand their resentment in that regard and, in particular, of the attention which the court has paid to the offender’s situation rather than to theirs. I also understand that no penalty is adequate from a family’s perspective. The court’s function is, however, to make a different kind of judgment, taking into account the considerations to which I have referred in the way I have mentioned. 
    27 Pursuant to s23(1)(a) of the Act, I indicate that, if the special hearing had been a normal trial against a person fit to be tried, with conviction for each of the offences charged, I would have imposed sentences of imprisonment in each case. Were I imposing such sentences in isolation from each other, I would have fixed a sentence for the malicious wounding offence of one year and six months and for the offence of manslaughter of 5 years and 6 months. 
    28 Section 23(5) enables me to take into account the period during which the offender has been in custody, that is from 26 January 1999 to date, and to backdate the term accordingly 
    29 Pursuant to s23(1)(b) and applying the principle of totality, for the offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I nominate a limiting term of one year, commencing on 26 January 1999 and expiring on 25 January 2000. For the offence of manslaughter I nominate a limiting term of five years commencing on 26 January 2000 and expiring on 25 January 2005. 
    30 Pursuant to s24(1)(a), I refer the offender to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
    31 Counsel agree that the appropriate order pursuant to s24(1)(b) is that the offender be kept in strict custody. That order would operate pending any further order of the Court in response to a determination by the Tribunal. The offender is presently accommodated at Mulawa Correctional Centre under conditions which are unsuitable and inhumane. She should, on the evidence before me, be accommodated in a secure psychiatric hospital ward, receiving appropriate treatment which is not available to her in prison. However, on the evidence before me, no such facility exists in New South Wales for females in this offender’s mental condition. The situation may require more thorough examination by the Court when the Tribunal has made its determination. Meanwhile, as an interim measure, I make the order proposed by counsel. I order, pursuant to s24(1)(b), that the offender be held in strict custody. 
    32 In summary: 
     
      
     (1) For the offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I nominate a limiting term of one year, commencing on 26 January 1999 and expiring on 25 January 2000; 
      
      
     (2) For the offence of manslaughter, I nominate a limiting term of five years commencing on 26 January 2000 and expiring on 25 January 2005; 
      
      
     (3) I refer the offender to the Mental Health Review Tribunal; 
      
      
     (4) I order that the offender be held in strict custody.

    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Vinh Ngoc Phan has pleaded guilty before me on 9 November 2001 to being an accessory after the fact to the murder by Bao Pham of the deceased Zi Qiang Jin (Jimmy Jin) on 11 July 1997. 
     
      
    2 At about 9:20 pm on that day, in an unnamed lane at Fairfield, the deceased died, having been shot three times to the head, neck and back. There was evidence that the deceased was shot in the head from different directions. There was evidence tending to suggest that more than one weapon was used in shooting. 
     
      
    3 At the time of the shooting he was seated in the driver's seat of a small sedan. The engine was running and the vehicle's transmission was in drive. He had apparently left his brother's home a short distance from the scene of the death shortly prior to his death after receiving a telephone call in which he had expressed his reluctance to go out but had agreed to go. 
     
      
    4 There was evidence to connect Bao Pham with the deceased. There was no evidence connecting this offender with the deceased, by way of prior association. 
     
      
    5 It was the Crown case against this offender on this charge that he was present at the scene, indeed in the car, that presence being admitted by him to the police eventually during the investigation, and no doubt admitted in consequence of the finding at the scene of his blood and of a fingerprint on the outside of the car.  
     
      
    6 The trail of blood left by the offender suggested that he had left the vehicle, in which the death occurred, to go to another vehicle, apparently to be driven by another person. 
     
      
    7 The day following the death the offender, who had suffered a laceration to his forehead at the scene, attended Dr. Le for treatment. He gave to Dr. Le a false account of what had occurred. He had given to the police, when the matter was initially investigated, false accounts seeking to distance himself from the scene and to conceal the manner in which he had received this injury. 
     
      
    8 On 6 May 1999, however, in an interview with police where he had attended the police station with his solicitor voluntarily, he admitted his presence at the shooting, but denying any involvement in the shooting himself. He asserted that he had been requested by his friend Bao to attend a meeting with him and that the shooting occurred during that meeting when Bao had an argument with the deceased. He says that whilst he was in the car there was gunfire in which he was injured, he lost consciousness and, in due course, was taken for treatment. 
     
      
    9 In particular, as going to support the charge to which he has now pleaded guilty, the Crown relies upon false statements made by him to police on 19 August 1997 concerning ownership of a mobile phone, which statements were made with the intent of deflecting police attention from both Bao and, it follows, from himself; a statement made on 13 February 1998 falsely stating to police that he did not know the deceased and that the scar on his forehead was from a bike accident; and the statement on 13 March 1998 falsely stating he had no knowledge of a Holden Commodore where that that knowledge was relevant to the investigation. 
     
      
    10 He was arrested on 7 August 1998. Subsequently, on 29 March and 6 May he deliberately withheld relevant information from the police with the intent of concealing Bao's involvement. I have already referred to what he told the police about his presence on 6 May. He sought to conceal from the police on the earlier occasion that he had been present at the relevant meeting. He sought to conceal from police on both occasions that he had been present at other meetings; that Bao and the deceased were engaged in the distribution and sale of illegal drugs and weapons, that he had been present when Bao had received the telephone call from the deceased shortly prior to the shooting occurring; that he and Bao had been driven to the scene and from the scene after the shooting by Jason Hanser in a yellow Holden Commodore sedan, that the following morning he heard Bao and Hanser discussing whether the weapons had been concealed. 
     
      
    11 It has also been put to me by the Crown as factual material upon which I should rely that he agreed to comply with a direction from Bao not to tell Dr. Le the truth as to how he had received the injury to his forehead. 
     
      
    12 Following his arrest on 7 August 1998 he remained in custody, except for a short period on bail until brought forward for trial for the murder of the deceased. 
     
      
    13 At that trial he pleaded not guilty. The trial was of himself alone, Bao not being brought to trial with him at that time. 
     
      
    14 After an extensive and costly trial to the community he was found guilty of murder. He appealed. The appeal was allowed principally for errors in directions given by the trial judge. A new trial was ordered. He came forward with the co-accused Bao Pham for trial before me last month. 
     
      
    15 A number of interlocutory steps were at that time indicated to me as appropriate to be undertaken prior to the empanelment of a jury. Pham had only been committed for trial quite recently prior to the matter coming forward for trial. The proceedings against him, on his application, have been stood over. 
     
      
    16 Whilst it was sought to resolve the pre-trial applications in connection with those interlocutory steps to which I have referred, it was indicated to me that it was proposed by the Crown that the accused plead guilty to the present offence, and that, should he so plead guilty and should he give an undertaking of an appropriate form to give evidence, it was the intention of the Crown that a nolle prosequi be entered in respect of the indictment for murder upon which he had been brought to trial, or a no bill, whichever was procedurally appropriate. 
     
      
    17 He has subsequently pleaded guilty, as I have said, on 9 November, and today the proceedings on the plea have continued. 
     
      
    18 Before me has been tendered a statement of the facts of the offence, to which I have referred already in these remarks. The offender's prior record has been admitted into evidence. That record includes offences of being an unlicensed driver, stating a false name and possessing a prohibited drug, for which he has been fined. They are not such as would otherwise deprive him of leniency. 
     
      
    19 There has also been tendered before me an undertaking to give evidence, coupled with an extensive transcript of an interview with police which transcript indicates, as far as I have been able to evaluate it, in the context of what was said in the Crown facts, that the evidence he might give at trial would be extremely valuable to the Crown, and that on the information presently put to me, his cooperation has been enthusiastic and detailed. He gave evidence that what he said to the police was true. 
     
      
    20 He has undertaken on oath to adhere to his promise to cooperate and give evidence on oath. He has, in addition, given evidence that he was frightened of his co-accused, who had a number of associates, and therefore the offender was willing to accede to his co-accused's wishes. It is accepted, and he has given evidence to this effect, that it is his family's intention, because of their fears, to move interstate once he has honoured his undertaking to give evidence. 
     
      
    21 He has explained his withholding of information from the police and his earlier erroneous information on the basis that he says he was frightened of Bao Pham and had fallen amongst bad friends. He said that he had to conceal the information but recognised that now is his final opportunity to tell the truth. He says he regrets having been involved and regrets that he has put his family in this position. He is worried both for himself and his family. He says that he received a phone call from the person Jason Hanser last night in which that person swore at him. He hung up. He said that this call was the first time he had been contacted by that person in a long while. I see no reason not to accept what he says. 
     
      
    22 He is presently aged 22, resides with his parents, was born in Vietnam and came to Australia at aged 13. He has one sister and three brothers; they are younger than he. He left school at Year 9, had difficulty finding employment because he had then and has now some substantial difficulty in reading and writing and in speaking English. He has, however, kept learning English in gaol and it has improved. He has been involved in learning printing work in gaol and would like to get employment as a printer. 
     
      
    23 He initially indicated a willingness to co-operate to an extent in May 1999 when he attended with his solicitor to be reinterviewed by the police, but from what I have already said it is apparent that then there was not full and frank co-operation; indeed, although he implicated himself as present at the scene, that, as I have said, may well have been because already, in the hands of the police, were the indicia of his presence at the scene. 
     
      
    24 He has subsequently been interviewed twice. In that material it appears he has fully and frankly co-operated with the police. 
     
      
    25 His plea was apparently accepted as soon as it was offered, and as a matter of practical utility must be regarded as accepted at the earliest practical opportunity. 
     
      
    26 He has spent in custody approximately one year and 10 months. That custody was referable to the murder charge, and it is submitted by the Crown that I should have regard to that custody when sentencing on this charge. Of course part of the reason why he has been in custody, as he was, was because of his own unwillingness to tell the truth to the authorities. I am not, however, prepared to speculate that the course now taken by the authorities might have been taken much earlier if he had told the truth. On the other hand, one cannot regard the time that he has spent in custody as being as a result of a mis-appreciation by the Crown of the true factual situation unless one has regard to the fact that he contributed to that misapprehension. 
     
      
    27 He now having given the undertaking, I understand it will be the intention of the Crown to terminate, in the manner I have referred to, the murder charge against him, but it is to be noted that his willingness to co-operate is given without the assurance of an indemnity protecting him from liability for any offence. It may be that a trial judge might give him a certificate under s.128 of the Evidence Act if the circumstances warrant it, but before me that possibility has not been mentioned. His co-operation seems to be wholehearted without the expectation that he will receive an immunity or indemnity. So that the value of his present and future co-operation is high, notwithstanding his earlier plea of not guilty and failure to reveal the truth has cost the community the value of the previous trial and appeal. I do not think that I should have regard to that latter matter when assessing the utilitarian value of his present plea, which for the purposes recognised both at common law and by the guideline judgment in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 as a matter warranting a substantially reduced sentence. 
     
      
    28 It is clear law that on appeal, in the event that he should fail to honour his undertaking, the Court of Criminal Appeal might restore that proportion of the sentence reduced for that reason. Reductions of sentence on that basis therefore need to be quantified, at least generally, so that the Court of Criminal Appeal might be in the position to perform its function in the event of an appeal. The extent of such a reduction varies of course from case to case. There have been reductions as high as 50% as I here allow or more. The extent to which the value of assistance is to be measured is not only by reason of the risk at which the offender is put, the risk to his family, the assessment of the greater hardship to be suffered by him in consequence, but by reason of the intrinsic value of assistance to the State (see Regina v. Darwiche [1999] NSWCCA 293, per the Chief Justice at paragraph 18). 
     
      
    29 It is plain law that there must be substantial acknowledgement of mitigation of penalty in such cases, and it is good practice for the extent and nature of the acknowledgement to be made clear by the sentencing judge (see Regina v. Leonard [2000] NSWCCA 28 at paragraph 9). 
     
      
    30 Other matters which might sound in a reduced sentence I have already referred to. They include the additional hardship that might be suffered by reason of the course taken; I have referred to and have taken into account the fact of the plea and its timing and s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    31 There have been a number of submissions put to me as to the available sentencing options. It is accepted by the Crown that if he is returned to custody he is at risk; but not only is he at risk, but also the evidence he might give and the assistance he might provide to the State would be at risk. It is a matter of notorious fact that persons in circumstances such as his, if returned to gaol, may require protection so strict as to require a gaol regimen, which is itself of dramatically cruel impact upon them. It was that fact that gave rise to the grant of bail between plea and this hearing. It is to that fact and the potential loss of what appears to be valuable evidence to the State to which I have regard in the selection of the particular sentence I will pass. 
     
      
    32 The maximum penalty provided for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. That is a maximum recently introduced into the law of this State. It would appear to have the effect of increasing the gravity with which the court should regard such offences. Nonetheless, the circumstances of this offence appear to me to be such, as they have been put to me, as to show an inadvertent involvement by the offender, a fear of the co-offender, and a fear for himself, based on entirely reasonable grounds, that his position would be misunderstood and that he was at risk of a murder conviction. I apprehend that there was a fair measure of consideration of self-preservation, as well as an apprehension of the co-accused underlying the untruthful statements and concealment constituting the offence, but it is accepted by the plea and the course the Crown proposes to take that he was not genuinely liable for the murder and that the period he has spent in custody should be taken into account as referable to the offence to which he has now pleaded. That seems, in the context of these events, only common justice. 
     
      
    33 It has been submitted by the Crown that he should not be returned to custody. That submission has also been made by counsel on his behalf. 
     
      
    34 Other sentencing options, such as periodic detention or community service, seem entirely inappropriate in the context of this offender's situation as it will be and the status he will have, once he has given evidence. They are inconsistent also with the family's attempt to make a new life in another State concealing what has happened and what he has had to do here. 
     
      
    35 A fine, in his circumstances, is totally inappropriate. Long term custody has the disadvantages, to which I have already referred, and to those I have been referred in particular as to the risk by the Crown and the defence. Nor do the facts seem to warrant it. 
     
      
    36 It would be inappropriate that there not be some continued form of sanction and supervision over the accused. A sentence of less than three years could provide a solution in that I would be required to nominate an automatic release date, which could be immediate and the sentence could backdate. 
     
      
    37 As a mechanism, effectively that would allow only one year two months of parole period and practically would be of limited utility. No doubt these considerations underlay the submission of the Crown that the appropriate course to take was, having regard to the period that the offender had already spent in custody I should, having determined that imprisonment is the appropriate course, then give consideration to suspending that term of imprisonment. Such a term of imprisonment, if imposed today, if it were to be suspended, would have to be a term of two years or less. It would provide for a longer sentence in that case than the option of a sentence of three years or less backdated, and it could provide for immediate release and, in addition, provide that the offender would be aware that the sentence would be suspended upon condition that he enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour and such other conditions as the Crown and the offender's counsel might submit appropriately should be inserted in the recognisance. 
     
      
    38 In all the circumstances, I have concluded that that is the appropriate sentence for me to impose. I am minded therefore to sentence the offender to a sentence of two years to date from today and to suspend the execution of the whole of the sentence, directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence upon the appropriate conditions. For that reason, there will be no non-parole period. 
     
      
    39 Would you please rise, Mr. Phan. For the crime to which you have pleaded guilty and of which you stand convicted, I sentence you to imprisonment for two years to commence today. I suspend the execution of that sentence for the whole of its term, directing that you be released from custody today on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence, which bond is to contain a condition that you inform the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of your address from time to time as it may be during the entire term of the sentence.

     Friday 9th November 2001. 
      
      R. v. Mark LEWIS 
      
      
      Judgment 
     1 HODGSON JA:: On 19th November 1999, after a trial lasting fourteen days, the appellant Mark Lewis was found guilty by a jury on two charges: first, that on 14th February 1994 at Gladesville in the State of New South Wales he did murder Kerrie Pang; and second, that on 14th February 1994 at Gladesville in the State of New South Wales he did murder Fatma Ozonal.  
      
       
     2 The appellant was sentenced on 9th June 2000. For the murder of Kerrie Pang, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. For the murder of Fatma Ozonal, he was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment, commencing on 28th April 1999 and expiring on 27th April 2017. A non-publication order was made to protect the identity of the son of the appellant and Ms. Pang.  
      
       
     3 The appellant appeals from his conviction, and seeks leave to appeal from the sentence.  
      
       
     4 The Crown case was that the appellant participated in a joint criminal enterprise with Lindsay Rose to murder the appellant’s de facto Ms. Pang, in the course of which Ms. Ozonal was also murdered. The Crown case was that there was a third participant in the enterprise, namely Ronald Waters, who assisted Rose to obtain access to the premises where Ms. Pang was murdered. 
      
       
     5 Before considering the case on appeal, it is convenient to first outline the circumstances clearly established by evidence at the trial.  
      
       
        
       CIRCUMSTANCES CLEARLY ESTABLISHED 
       
     6 The deceased Kerrie Pang had been the appellant’s de facto for three to four years before her murder. The appellant and Ms. Pang had a fifteen month old son; and Ms. Pang also had four sons from previous relationships. The appellant and Ms. Pang were living together in a rented house in Cherrybrook.  
      
       
     7 On the basis of the appellant’s own statements to police and of evidence which was substantially unchallenged at the trial and on appeal, the following events occurred on 14th February 1994. The timing of the events was firmly established by records of telephone communications from and to the mobile phone of Ms. Pang.  
      
       
     8 At 5.30pm, Ms. Pang was at her business premises “Kerrie’s Oasis” at 4 Flagstaff Street, Gladesville, at which she conducted a “relaxation centre” or massage parlour. Also there was an employee Ms. Ozonal.  
      
       
     9 At that time, the appellant Mark Lewis was at his business premises in West Ryde, where he conducted a similar business. Also at these premises was Chris Lee, another employee of Ms. Pang’s business, who was helping out in the appellant’s business on that day.  
      
       
     10 Between about 5.30pm and 6.30pm, Ms. Pang was on the telephone to one Trevor McIvor. During that phone call, the appellant telephoned Ms. Pang and said words to the effect that he was not feeling well, and asked if Ms. Pang would come and pick him up at West Ryde and take him home. There may have been more than one such call from the appellant to Ms. Pang interrupting her telephone conversation with Mr. McIvor: in any event, one such call was probably made around 6.15pm.  
      
       
     11 Ms. Pang then drove to West Ryde. It appears that she had left Kerrie’s Oasis by 6.26pm, because there was a call from her mobile phone to Kerrie’s Oasis at that time, and another such call at 6.30pm. At 6.31pm, there was a call from Ms. Pang’s mobile phone to the appellant’s private line at West Ryde, presumably to advise that she was on her way.  
      
       
     12 Ms. Pang arrived at the appellant’s West Ryde premises about 6.48pm. At that time, there was another call from Ms. Pang’s mobile phone to the appellant’s private line at West Ryde, presumably to tell him she was about to arrive.  
      
       
     13 When Ms. Pang arrived, the appellant told her he had received a phone call in which the caller said he would kill Ms. Pang. At about 6.50pm, Ms. Pang telephoned Ryde Police Station and spoke to Sergeant de Belin, and told him about the death threat. The appellant also spoke to Sergeant de Belin. Ms. Pang told Sergeant de Belin that she wished to speak to Detective Letchford about the matter, and was told that Detective Letchford was with the Chatswood Police. Ms. Pang then left a message for Detective Letchford with the Chatswood Police.  
      
       
     14 At about 7.00pm, Ms. Pang and the appellant left West Ryde to drive to Kerrie’s Oasis, each in her and his own car, the appellant’s being a white Tarago van. At 7.11pm, there was a call from Ms. Pang’s mobile phone to Kerrie’s Oasis, presumably to advise Ms. Ozonal that she was on her way back to Kerrie’s Oasis. At 7.18pm, there was a call from Ms. Pang’s mobile phone to the West Ryde premises, where Ms. Lee remained, in which, according to Ms. Lee, Ms. Pang asked if everything was alright there.  
      
       
     15 According to the appellant, he and Ms. Pang stopped at a shop on the way to Kerrie’s Oasis to get bread, butter and tuna.  
      
       
     16 Both cars were then parked in the car park at Kerrie’s Oasis, at a time which must have been very close to 7.20pm. Both Ms. Pang and the appellant stood beside the appellant’s car while a bag containing a .22 rifle was taken from the boot of the appellant’s car. They both walked to the door of Kerrie’s Oasis, and it is clear that Ms. Pang went inside. According to the appellant’s statements to police, he did not go inside, but returned to his car and drove back to West Ryde.  
      
       
     17 At about the time when Ms. Pang came to the door of Kerrie’s Oasis or possibly shortly afterwards, inside Kerrie’s Oasis, Ms. Ozonal was shot three times and killed by Rose, in the presence of Waters. A little later again, inside Kerrie’s Oasis, Ms. Pang was shot and stabbed many times and killed.  
      
       
     18 A neighbour heard a single gunshot at a time she estimated to be about 7.15pm. In fact, if this was one of the eight shots or thereabouts fired inside Kerrie’s Oasis, it must have been between about 7.20pm and 7.30pm.  
      
       
     19 After the two people had been killed, the killer or killers set fire to Kerrie’s Oasis. Smoke was observed coming from Kerrie’s Oasis at about 7.30pm, and fire fighters arrived at 7.42pm.  
      
       
     20 The appellant arrived back at West Ryde at a time Ms. Lee estimated to be about 8.00pm, and certainly it must have been after 7.30pm. 
      
       
     21 The appellant remained at West Ryde until about 9.00pm with Ms. Lee. They then closed the premises and left. The appellant drove to Kerrie’s Oasis, arriving at about 9.15pm. When told of Ms. Pang’s death, he collapsed and was taken to hospital. 
      
       
     22 The appellant made a statement to the police that night, and there was a recorded interview early the next morning. These statements were consistent with the above account up to the time of the appellant going to the door of Kerrie’s Oasis with Ms. Pang, except in relation to the times of the occurrence of the various events that I have referred to. According to the appellant, when the rifle bag was taken from the boot of the car, Ms. Pang wanted to take it, the appellant decided she should not, and the appellant put the rifle back into the van. According to the appellant, he and Ms. Pang walked to the entrance, Ms. Pang went inside, the appellant went back to the car and drove back to West Ryde, arriving, according to the appellant’s statements, between about 6.00pm and 6.30pm – that is, more than one hour before the time when the appellant actually got back to West Ryde. 
      
       
     23 Lindsay Rose pleaded guilty to the murders of Ms. Pang and Ms. Ozonal, and was sentenced to life imprisonment for those and other murders on 3rd September 1998.  
      
       
     24 Ronald Waters was charged with the murders of Ms. Pang and Ms. Ozonal. On 7th May 1999, he pleaded guilty to two counts of being an accessory after the fact to the murders, and was sentenced to concurrent terms of eighteen months imprisonment, to be served by way of periodic detention. The murder charges were not pursued.  
      
       
        
       OTHER EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL 
       
     25 There was police evidence that a .22 rifle in a burgundy bag was found inside the appellant’s Tarago van. There was forensic evidence that eight shots fired in Kerrie’s Oasis came from the same .22 weapon, which was not the weapon found in the appellant’s van.  
      
       
     26 There was forensic evidence concerning blood stains found on the rifle bag: some of these matched Ms. Pang’s grouping, and also Ms. Pang’s DNA. There was a blood stain inside the bag that did not match Ms. Pang’s blood or the appellant’s blood.  
      
       
     27 There was evidence of small brown spots on the appellant’s right running shoe, brown shorts, and shirt worn that night. In relation to these spots, the preliminary or screening test for blood was positive, although the spots could, on the basis of that test, also be from a chemical or protein source. DNA matching that of Ms. Pang was found on these items, although it could have been DNA from skin cells, sweat or saliva rather than from blood.  
      
       
     28 A number of witnesses called for the prosecution testified that the relationship between the appellant and Ms. Pang was volatile, and characterised by jealousy and arguments. One witness gave evidence that, three days before her death, Ms. Pang told her that she wanted out of the relationship with the appellant, and was asking him to pay $500.00 per week for a nanny for their son.  
      
       
     29 However, evidence was called for the appellant about the relationship, including evidence that Ms. Pang said to a witness, about a week before her death, that she loved the appellant “with all his faults”; that the appellant was never observed to be a violent or threatening man; and that on 5th November 1993, Ms. Pang consulted a gynaecologist about attempts to have another baby. 
      
       
     30 There was also evidence that Rose and Ms. Pang had been in a relationship, prior to Ms. Pang’s relationship with the appellant; and evidence that Rose hated Ms. Pang.  
      
       
     31 The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. Rose did not give evidence. The murder weapon and the knife used to stab Ms. Pang were not produced in evidence.  
      
       
     32 A crucial witness for the prosecution was Waters, who gave the following evidence.  
      
       
     33 He gave evidence of accompanying Rose, with whom he was acquainted, to the premises at 4 Flagstaff Street, Gladesville on 14th February 1994. The role Waters was to play was to present himself at the door of the premises and speak to the person who answered the door, in order to gain access for both men to the premises. Rose offered Waters $500.00 to perform this role.  
      
       
     34 They met at the Burwood RSL at around 6.00pm on that day, although the meeting was not pre-arranged. Rose asked Waters if he would help him out, and Waters agreed. They went from the RSL to Rose’s home, where they got into Rose’s vehicle and drove to Gladesville. Rose spoke to someone on his mobile phone during the drive.  
      
       
     35 Rose parked his car in a cross-street and they went to the premises. Waters knocked on the door, which was answered by Ms. Ozonal, while Rose hid with his back against the wall. Ms. Ozonal let Waters in, and Rose followed him with a pistol, and started yelling at Ms. Ozonal, demanding to know the whereabouts of Ms. Pang, to which Ms. Ozonal responded that she was at the doctor’s office with her husband. Rose then took the phone off the hook and directed Ms. Ozonal into another room, while telling Waters to stand at the window and keep a lookout for the arrival of any personal vehicle.  
      
       
     36 Subsequently, Waters looked out the window and saw a man and a woman walking away from two vehicles towards the premises. Waters informed Rose of this, and then saw Rose shoot Ms. Ozonal in the head.  
      
       
     37 On Rose’s direction, Waters went into another room and hid. From his position he could see into the reception area of the premises. Rose went into another room. Waters heard the door open and heard Ms. Pang calling out to Ms. Ozonal. Ms. Pang moved down the hallway as though she had been pushed or was running. Ms. Pang saw Rose and said words to the effect that there was no need for him to be there, that everything had been settled. Rose responded by saying that it was “too late”, that he had shot Ms. Ozonal and she would have to be killed as well. 
      
       
     38 Waters then left the room in which he had been hiding and noticed the man who he had seen coming to the premises with Ms. Pang in the doorway of one of the rooms holding a rifle. Waters struck him, disarmed him and tackled him to the ground. According to Waters, Rose then said “Don’t hurt the man. He is paying for the job”.  
      
       
     39 Rose and Ms. Pang struggled over Rose’s pistol. Waters went to help Rose by striking Ms. Pang to the face three times. Ms. Pang fell to the floor, then got up and ran down the hallway towards the back of the house while Rose picked up a silencer that had come off the pistol. The other man said to Rose “hurry up and get it over and done with” on more than one occasion, and Rose followed Ms. Pang towards the rear of the premises. When Rose returned he told Waters and the other man to leave as the house was on fire.  
      
       
     40 The three men then left the premises, Waters being told to leave the main door open to enable the fire to spread more effectively. The other man carried his rifle in a rifle bag. They walked towards the man’s van, which was a Tarago. The man placed his rifle bag in the mid section of the van. Rose advised the other man to go home and wait for the police to contact him, and then to feign a heart attack on being told of Ms. Pang’s death. Rose and Waters then left in Rose’s car.  
      
       
        
       APPEAL ON CONVICTION 
       
     41 The appellant appeals from his conviction on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable, cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice. The appellant was unrepresented on this aspect of the case.  
      
       
        
        
        
        
       Submissions 
       
     42 First, Mr. Lewis submitted that it was highly improbable that the events would have occurred as described by Waters. He submitted that, if he had organised Ms. Pang’s murder, surely he would have arranged an alibi and not been at the scene. Why would he have gone into the premises with her, and why would he have gone in with an empty rifle? In any event, he submitted there was no motive for him to arrange for Ms. Pang’s murder: although he objected to her participation in the activities of her business, this only gave rise to verbal arguments and never violence. He submitted also that the evidence at the trial showed that Rose hated Ms. Pang. 
      
       
     43 Next, Mr. Lewis submitted that Waters’ evidence could not be relied on. He told untruths in relation to scratch marks on his face and in denying that he went to a medical centre. He claimed that he struck the third person on the face as hard as he could, and struggled with that person; yet Mr. Lewis had no marks on his face, and none of Waters’ DNA on his clothing. Although Waters claimed to have taken the rifle from Mr. Lewis, Waters’ fingerprints were not found on the rifle. Waters’ descriptions of the third person changed from time to time, and they never included obvious features of Mr. Lewis’ own appearance, such as glasses and prominent teeth.  
      
       
     44 Next, in relation to the evidence concerning blood and DNA, Mr. Lewis submitted that it was not proved that there was any blood on his shorts, shirt or shoe; and although the blood on the outside of the rifle bag was probably from Ms. Pang, that on the inside of the rifle bag was from neither Ms. Pang nor Ms. Ozonal nor Mr. Lewis. There was no evidence as to how old the blood was. The DNA found on Mr. Lewis’ clothing could have been from skin cells or sweat or saliva.  
      
       
     45 Mr. Lewis submitted that he did not believe he had had a fair trial, and he submitted that the Court had not been given the true facts. Apart from Waters, the only person who knew what had happened was Rose, and he was not called for the prosecution. Mr. Lewis informed the Court that he had requested his legal advisers that Rose be subpoenaed, and was told that this could not be done. He also informed the Court that he was advised by his legal advisers that there was no need for him to give evidence, and for that reason did not do so. He submitted that the original brief delivered to him included evidence that the murder weapon had been supplied of and disposed of by a corrupt police officer; and yet no evidence about that had been led at the trial.  
      
       
     46 Finally, in his written submissions Mr. Lewis submitted that the statement which, according to Waters, Rose made to the effect that “he is paying for it” was hearsay.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     47 Dealing first with the last submission, I note first that Mr. Lewis was represented by Senior Counsel at his trial, and no objection was taken to the piece of evidence referred to on the ground of hearsay, and no complaint was made about the trial judge’s directions concerning that matter. In my opinion, the evidence about Rose’s alleged statement was plainly admissible as part of the narrative of the events of the murders themselves, and the activities of Rose and Waters and the third man in relation to those events. In those circumstances, ss.60 and 136 of the Evidence Act became relevant. Those sections are as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         60 The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation 
          
         … 
          
         136. The court may limit the use to be made of evidence if there is a danger that a particular use of the evidence might:  
          
         (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or  
          
         (b) be misleading or confusing.  
         
        
       
     48 The effect of s.60 is that the statement alleged to have been made by Rose did become evidence of what Rose had intended to assert, unless an order was made under s.136 limiting the effect which could be given to the statement. No application was made for any order under s.136.  
      
       
     49 In those circumstances, the admission and treatment of that material does not give a ground of appeal.  
      
       
     50 Some of Mr. Lewis’ submission seem to be to the effect that he would wish to have a trial in which further evidence could be led. That can be the basis for setting aside a conviction and ordering a new trial only if it is required in the interests of justice, because there is evidence which could well have made a difference to the result and in respect of which there is a satisfactory explanation why that evidence was not called. We have been shown no reason to think that evidence which Rose could have given would have made a difference to the result, nor that evidence concerning the murder weapon would have made any difference to the result. Furthermore, the circumstance that legal advisers representing an accused made forensic decisions in the course of a trial with the result that evidence was not called does not justify an appeal court ordering a new trial.  
      
       
     51 The submissions made by Mr. Lewis concerning the improbability of the Crown case against him were matters appropriate to be put to the jury, and for the most part, were put to the jury. I take them into account in relation to the appellant’s submission that the verdict was unreasonable, in conjunction with his submissions concerning the unreliability of Waters’ evidence.  
      
       
     52 In my opinion, the real question is whether, having regard to all the matters raised by Mr. Lewis, Waters’ account of the murders and of the role of the third person in them should have been accepted by the jury, so as to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt that this third person was guilty of the murders. 
      
       
     53 If the jury could have been reasonably satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt, there is in my opinion no possible doubt about the identification of the appellant as this third person, even though Waters was not able to identify the appellant. I say this for these reasons: Mr. Waters gave evidence of Ms. Pang and the third person walking from two cars parked side by side outside Kerrie’s Oasis minutes before the murders; the appellant had driven with Ms. Pang in two cars to Kerrie’s Oasis, arriving within about five minutes of the murders, and then walked with her to the door of Kerrie’s Oasis; after the murders, Waters said the third person put a rifle bag in a white Tarago van, being one of the two vehicles from which Ms. Pang and the third person had walked a few minutes earlier; so, in my opinion, it is inconceivable that a person other than the appellant could fit into this scenario.  
      
       
     54 Could a reasonable jury have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the third person participated in the events as described by Waters? The elements of this participation included the following (accepting that the appellant was the third person): the appellant came into Kerrie’s Oasis, was present throughout, and left with Rose and Waters; the appellant participated in the events; Rose said that the appellant was paying for it; and the appellant said words to the effect “hurry up, get it over with”.  
      
       
     55 As to the first of those elements, the appellant coming into Kerrie’s Oasis, according to the appellant the whole purpose of getting Ms. Pang to come to West Ryde in the first place was to alert her to a death threat (the appellant seems to assert that the reason given over the phone, of his being unwell, was a pretext adopted so that Ms. Pang would not be alarmed). This raises the question, why would the appellant go back to Kerrie’s Oasis with Ms. Pang, in their separate cars, unless he had the purpose of ensuring that she was safe at Kerrie’s Oasis? According to the appellant’s version, he went with her to the door, and this must have been at the very time when Rose was about to shoot or in the process of shooting Ms. Ozonal; and yet the appellant, on his account, allowed Ms. Pang to go into Kerrie’s Oasis by herself, where she was murdered minutes later. Subsequently, the appellant gave an account to the police according to which he had not been near Kerrie’s Oasis since shortly after 6pm, over one hour before he was in fact at Kerrie’s Oasis. Added to this, there was blood consistent with Ms. Pang’s blood on his rifle case, and a blood-like substance on the appellant’s clothes, with DNA consistent with Ms. Pang’s DNA obtained from his clothes.  
      
       
     56 Even without Waters’ evidence, all those circumstances amounted to an extremely strong circumstantial case that the appellant went into Kerrie’s Oasis with Ms. Pang, and in so far as the jury’s verdict involved satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant went inside, was present during the murder of Ms. Pang, and left with Rose and Waters after the murder, the jury’s finding to that effect could not be unreasonable.  
      
       
     57 So much follows without significant reliance on Waters’ evidence. Water’s evidence is more significant in relation to what actually happened inside Kerrie’s Oasis. Without his evidence, it might be conceivable from the circumstantial evidence that the appellant, after going inside Kerrie’s Oasis, was intimidated by Rose and Waters so that he did not prevent the killing, and later lied because he was afraid of reprisals if he identified Rose and Waters as the killers. However, no hypothesis of that kind was ever suggested by the appellant either in his statements to the police or otherwise.  
      
       
     58 The trial judge gave the following direction in relation to the evidence of Waters:  
      
       
        
         
         There is a direction which I now give you concerning the evidence of Ronald Waters. He is a witness who was criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings. You heard him give evidence that he was dealt with leniently by the court because of the assistance he promised to give with respect to the proceedings against Lindsey Rose and against the accused in these proceedings. He also conceded that if he did not give evidence in accordance with the statements which he made, that he was liable to be brought before the court and re-sentenced. 
          
          
         The need to give such a direction arises because the courts have, over the years, accumulated a great deal of experience concerning the reliability of evidence given by witnesses criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings and that experience would not readily be known to general members of the public, such as yourselves. That experience has shown that the evidence given by such witnesses is often unreliable. I do not intend to suggest that their evidence is always unreliable. My purpose in giving you this direction is only to warn that the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable and for that reason alone you must approach that evidence with considerable caution in the way in which I will outline shortly. 
          
          
         There are, no doubt, many reasons why the evidence of an accomplice may be unreliable. It is only natural, you may think, that an accomplice may want to shift the blame from himself onto others and to justify his own conduct. In the process, the accomplice may construct untruthful stories which tend to play down his own part in the crime and to play up the part of others in that crime. Experience has shown that once having been given that version to the police, the accomplice may feel that he is locked into that version and that he is bound to relate the same version when giving his evidence. 
          
          
         However, if you bear in mind the warning I have given you, and approach the evidence of Ronald Waters with considerable caution, you may convict the accused in reliance upon his evidence if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his evidence is true. 
         
        
       
     59 This forcefully and appropriately brought home to the jury the caution with which it should approach Waters’ evidence. In my opinion, taking into account the whole of the circumstantial case, the evidence of Waters (treated appropriately with the caution advised by the trial judge), and the absence of any hypothesis of the kind which I have mentioned being suggested by the appellant, it cannot be said that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. On the contrary, in my opinion it was reasonable and justified on the evidence. 
      
       
        
       APPEAL ON SENTENCE 
        
       Submissions 
       
     60 Mr. Boulten for the applicant referred to s.61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1991, and submitted that the reference in that provision to the “level of culpability in the commission of the offence” directs attention to the circumstances surrounding the offence, including subjective circumstances that may have contributed to its commission: R. v. Harris (2000) 50 NSWLR 409 at 419. It leaves to one side matters such as remorse, plea of guilty, and prospects of rehabilitation. Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4, Harris at 423. 
      
       
     61 Mr. Boulten submitted that a deliberate killing for payment is prima facie in the worst category: King (1998) 99 A Crim R 288 at 292, R. V. Baker NSWCCA 20/9/95. But the facts may mitigate the objective seriousness of the crime, and may eliminate the potential for the imposition of penal servitude for life, at least for the person who pays: King at 292.  
      
       
     62 Mr. Boulten referred to a number of cases of re-determination of life sentences under s.13A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1991, where persons involved in contract killings received determinate sentences, including King and Kalajzich (1997) 94 A Crim R 41. 
      
       
     63 Mr. Boulten submitted that the sentencing judge was in error in two respects: first, in taking into account as an aggravating feature that the victim’s death would deprive her five children of the care and comfort of a mother: see R. v. Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; and second, in rejecting the submission that the volatility of the domestic relationship in this case lessened the degree of criminality.  
      
       
     64 As regards the former, Mr. Boulten submitted that the fact that a victim has dependants could be relevant to the level of culpability only if the offender knew of this; and if that affected the level of culpability, it would be capricious in its application, because it would mean that a person is less culpable when killing strangers about whom the person knew nothing than when killing a person of whom the offender had knowledge.  
      
       
     65 As regards the second alleged error, Mr. Boulten submitted that it was erroneous to regard the circumstances of the killing in this case as making the volatility of the domestic relationship irrelevant: the volatility of that relationship can be regarded as having adversely affected the applicant’s decision-making capacity, and this was not excluded by the fact that, on the finding of the jury, the applicant contracted with another person for the killing of the victim.  
      
       
     66 The sentence was particularly harsh in circumstances where the applicant had no criminal record.  
      
       
        
       Decision 
       
     67 I accept that Previtera is authority for the proposition that the effect of a death upon the victim’s family, of itself, is not relevant to the culpability of the offender. However, that is not to say that the degree of harm which the offender knows will be caused by the offence is likewise not relevant: on the contrary, in my opinion the degree of harm which the offender knows will be caused by the offence is highly relevant to the culpability of the offender. In this case, quite plainly the applicant knew that the death of Ms. Pang would deprive five children of their mother, and prima facie that is serious harm, in addition to the death of Ms. Pang, which the applicant knew would be caused by his offence. This is not to say that the crime is more serious because Ms. Pang was in some way more worthy than other possible victims, merely to recognise the harm caused to children by the loss of their mother; and to recognise that where the offender knows that this harm will be caused, that can be relevant to the offender’s culpability. In my opinion, the sentencing judge made no error in this respect.  
      
       
     68 Turning to the other alleged error, the sentencing judge did not say that the volatility of a domestic relationship between an offender and a victim can never be relevant in the case of a contract killing. I accept that there could be cases in which one could say that the decision-making capacity of an offender was so adversely affected by the offender’s emotional relationship with the victim that this mitigated to some extent the culpability even of a contract killing; but in my opinion, there is no error in the view of the sentencing judge that this was not such a case.  
      
       
     69 As submitted by Mr. Berman SC for the Crown, the sentencing judge correctly noted a number of circumstances which together placed this killing into the worst category of cases: it was a contract killing, the deceased was blameless, the offence was planned, the applicant delivered the victim to her death, and the applicant provided encouragement to Rose to kill her. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that there was any error in the sentencing judge finding that this was a case where the culpability of the appellant was so extreme as to justify the imposition of a life sentence under s.61. Particularly this is so in circumstances where there were two killings, albeit that the appellant was not shown to have intended the death of Ms. Ozonal, but was found guilty of her murder on the basis of the felony murder principle. 
      
       
     70 The sentencing judge also took into account the lack of contrition, that being relevant to sentence although not being relevant to determination of whether the matter fell within s.61.  
      
       
     71 In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that error is shown.  
      
       
        
       CONCLUSION 
       
     72 The orders that I propose are: 
      
       
       1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
       2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, and appeal against sentence dismissed.

      REGINA v. LEYTON TERENCE MATTHEW WILLOUGHBY 
      
      
      SENTENCE 
      
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Leyton Terence Willoughby, has pleaded guilty before me to the manslaughter of Donald Francis Lewis. That plea was entered following a voir dire in which evidence was given on the question of whether or not his de facto spouse should be compelled to give evidence in the Crown case.  
    2 During that voir dire, I was able to form an assessment of his spouse and of her family circumstances as they related to the offender. Suffice it to say that what I then observed and heard gives some considerable support to some observations that were tendered in evidence before me by way of a report and the oral evidence of Mr. Kesby-Smith, clinical psychologist, and in particular as concerning the pressures on the offender in and about the time at which he committed his crime.  
    3 An agreed statement of facts has been tendered. That statement of facts sets out the observations, such as they were, of various witnesses as to what occurred. It does not express those inevitable conclusions that had to follow if one were to be concerned, as I must be, to find the facts fully.  
    4 The offender killed his victim more or less outside the flat in which he lived in Rochester Street, Botany, with the young woman who was his de facto. The deceased had been chased from immediately outside those premises into and along Rochester Street to a point at which he met his death. There was evidence available in the trial, and which is agreed in the statement of facts, that at the point at which he was observed by a witness, Mr. Smith, the deceased was sitting on the roadway with his hands held in a defensive manner when the offender punched him several times saying as he did so, ""why did you fucking steal from me?"". The deceased denied stealing anything. There were a number of such exchanges. 
    5 The offender kicked the deceased, apparently from about waist height, in the area of the face, either the foot or shin striking the deceased in a pretty hard kick. The deceased was kicked on the head a number of times. Again, the offender referred to what was apparently his belief that the deceased was stealing from him. At the end of this exchange, the accused stomped on the deceased's stomach.  
    6 Another person attended the scene and was informed by the offender that he had caught the deceased in the act of stealing. The second man tried to assist the deceased. The offender abused the deceased, but that apparently for the purpose of trying to get the deceased to stand up, indicating at least that the offender did not consider at that time that the deceased was seriously injured.  
    7 He lay there, however, while the offender and the other man left the scene. The other man said to the offender words to the effect of ""we can't leave him there"". They returned and tried to persuade the deceased to get up.  
    8 At about that time the offender rang directory enquiries seeking the number of the local police station, presumably for the purpose of reporting the theft, or for the purpose of reporting the condition of the deceased. Whatever be his intention, he did not carry that through because no other call was then monitored from that mobile phone, although that call was traced. A short time later, Mr. Smith saw the other man trying to get the deceased to his feet and to assist him. Liquid was poured onto his face but the second man left turning around as he did so.  
    9 Apparently what had happened was that the offender had inflicted upon the deceased a death dealing tear to his mesentery and after the deceased was left in the location observed by Mr. Smith by the offender and the other man, he proceeded somehow or other across the road to the rear of a motor car over which he fell as he died.  
    10 The immediate cause of death was the bleeding associated with the lacerated mesentery. The deceased may have been heard to be vomiting outside the premises in Rochester Street in the early hours of the morning. A witness testified to some such event occurring but when she went outside to try to identify who it might be was unable to see anyone to whom she could attribute that noise.  
    11 The medical pathologist observed lacerations to the head, the ear, the legs and the lip of the deceased, consistent with having been sustained in the altercation. There were other areas of abrasion consistent with the deceased falling on the car to which I have referred.  
    12 Shortly after this event, police officers spoke to the offender who gave them the false story that he had not been at home but had been at his parents' place.  
    13 It is not known how the deceased came to be in the vicinity in the early hours of that morning. However, there is nothing to suggest that he was in fact stealing or concerned in any nefarious activity at all, whether in relation to the offender's home, car or other property.  
    14 In the month following the death of the deceased, the offender had told his employer that he had confronted a prowler or thief looking in his window and had chased the man away.  
    15 The offender is some 26 years of age. He has no prior record. What he did that night was an extended serious assault culminating in a vicious series of acts of which probably the stomping caused the deceased's death. He may have had, and all the evidence suggests that he did have, a belief, genuinely held, though not reasonably formed, that the deceased was somehow involved in something nefarious towards him or his property, but what he did well exceeded any sensible, much less lawful, response in that he beat the deceased, pursued him and savagely and viciously assaulted him causing his death. 
    16 It does not seem, however, that he ever considered he might be doing serious injury to the deceased. It was on that basis that the plea of not guilty to murder, an offence which would have required the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt either that he intended to kill the deceased or that he intended to inflict on him really serious bodily harm or that knowing of the likelihood of causing death he went ahead with the assault anyway, was accepted. The basis of the charge of manslaughter and acceptance of the plea to it is that the deceased died as a result of the offender's unlawful and objectively dangerous act; that is, that the act he did causing the death was one which any reasonable person would have realised posed a real risk to the life and well-being of the deceased but which he the offender did not himself realise put the deceased at risk of death. The facts of this case show that this is a serious manslaughter. 
    17 In a statement made to the psychologist, to whose report I have already referred, the offender suggested that when he had initially confronted the deceased, the deceased struck him on the jaw. If such a thing occurred, it may well have occurred in circumstances in which the deceased was merely trying to protect himself against what he might have perceived as some attack upon him. The pathologist report shows that the deceased was quite intoxicated at the time.  
    18 The statement of the offender to the psychologist contained in the report admitted by consent and in respect of which the psychologist was cross-examined was that the offender had certainly suffered that evening the effects of severe emotional stress engendered by the tensions between himself and his own family and himself and his spouse and her family, consequent on her having provided the news of her pregnancy shortly beforehand, and in circumstances where both families plainly applied to this accused the most severe emotional pressure.  
    19 What he had done in consequence was to take marijuana, which he had been using for many years to a considerable extent and particularly since he had suffered a severe back condition some considerable time beforehand, alcohol, and later a tab of LSD. It may be that he was having a bad trip, it may be that he was not. It may have been that at the time of these events, whatever the effect of the LSD upon him was, it was waning. Nonetheless, his perceptions of what was going on may well have been appallingly flawed.  
    20 The Crown submissions are prepared to accept the possibility that on his part there was a grave misunderstanding of the conduct of the deceased. I am not prepared to find as a matter of fact that the deceased did strike him. I am not prepared to find as a matter of fact that the deceased had in fact given him any cause at all to believe that there was any nefarious purpose or aggression on the deceased's part. But I am not prepared to find as a matter of fact that the offender did not honestly and genuinely believe there was some occasion calling at least for the initial response. I am not prepared to accept he had any basis for going as far as he did beyond the initial confrontation, and certainly not any basis for stomping on the deceased the way he did.  
    21 All of that said, however, there is dramatic material contained in the report by the psychologist to suggest that notwithstanding his quite serious family difficulties, to which he had not contributed, and the quite serious domestic difficulties occasioned by his relationship with his wife and her family, that this offender had developed quite severe tensions and depression, had reached the point of feeling entirely entrapped in a situation that he could see no way out of and had resorted to the drugs as a method of temporary escape, that is, the drugs he took on the night, rather than the marijuana he had been using for years.  
    22 It appears that he remained in his car outside his home until the effects of the LSD were waning, and it was during that point of time by the most appalling coincidence early in the morning in darkness that Mr. Lewis came by. At that time, the offender conceived the idea, almost certainly as a gross misunderstanding, that the deceased had some nefarious role and that the deceased was somehow a threat. This has been, on the part of the offender, an appalling chapter of misunderstandings, if one accepts the proposition that there was a misunderstanding. It has caused him to take one life and to ruin another, his own. 
    23 He has denied the murder charge, he says, because he at no time intended to kill the deceased. 
    24 He has expressed to the psychologist the state of terror in which he was thereafter and in which he remained for some years. Indeed, the report suggests that he still remains in terror in gaol. It is to his credit that he has been deeply concerned for the welfare of his child in his absence in particular having regard to the attitudes of the two families and that of his de facto spouse. The psychiatrist described suicidal thoughts and a concern for his mother and his child. In gaol he asserts he has been stood over several times and strongly victimised.  
    25 He has become immensely concerned at his failure to be able to act as a father because of his incarceration. Over and above that, he has attempted to express contrition and remorse, indeed making an offer after these years to apologise to the family of the deceased. It is not at all surprising that they reject that apology now after all this time and that they assert they cannot see it as any adequate expression of contrition or expression of contrition at all.  
    26 On the other hand, it is the totality of the evidence of the psychologist, and it is consistent with what has been seen in court, that he has been in a state of rather severe fright at his fate and concerned at the families' position for now over three years. I accept that he burst into tears continuously throughout the interview. I accept that part of that is due to his own feelings of fright and entrapment, as well as some sorrow at what he has done to another. I do not regard, however, his expressions to the psychologist as unalloyed expressions of contrition and remorse.  
    27 He suffers, as I have said, from a back condition which seriously limits his flexion and which gives him some degree of pain. It is apparent that that is a matter that will need to be taken into account both as affecting how more onerous the sentence might be for him and his work prospects and rehabilitation prospects on release.  
    28 He will have to live with his parents, presumably, and his mother has, without any fault of hers, circumstances that make it difficult for her to be able to be of support to him. The report does not suggest he would be likely to receive over much assistance from his sisters or father. Indeed, the report, which is confirmed in this respect by a matter that arose during the trial, suggests that rather than he receiving support, it has been he who has provided for his father and family substantially, including in particular by passing over the whole of his compensation from the motor vehicle accident to try to preserve his father's business. Unfortunately, the money does not seem to have been used for that purpose and he has not had the benefit of any of it. 
    29 He does seem to have the motivation to go into various kinds of employment and it seems as though he has concern, as I have said, for his mother and daughter, which is estimable. But he is a person who patently has a personality defect that has led to the depression that the psychologist referred to in evidence before me and which appears to have contributed to the context for the offence. 
    30 It is, not surprisingly, noted in the report that the offender expressed high levels of unhappiness and depression at his domestic situation and at his personal situation, as well as at being unable to work as he might wish because of his back. 
    31 I believe his protestation contained in the report that he did not intend seriously to wound or to kill the deceased. It is apparent that the plea to manslaughter being accepted in discharge of the indictment for murder means that that fact is accepted by the Crown also, but I find he could not have failed to envisage that the actions that he performed would have caused some considerable harm and pain to the deceased. 
    32 Indeed, his account accepts that he was seeking to punish the deceased but did not want him to die. He says that he is unbelievably sorry. 
    33 Whilst in gaol, he has apparently experienced deep unhappiness and a deep sense of remorse. Although he has not, while on remand, obtained counselling, he has spent a considerable time with the chaplain, although he has not, he says, sought to embark on a flight into religion. He sought, however, to find some consolation from the concept of a forgiving God. Such a concept indicates that he is aware of the degree of his sin. 
    34 The psychologist suggested that his background history provided the basis for considering that this is a man whose condition is a psychologically complex one. He was apparently, in his infancy, treated with much anger and substantial physical violence, for minor matters or, indeed, undeserved matters and that his treatment within his own family was such to take advantage of him rather than to support him. He became marked by a strong sense of personal inadequacy and it was that that caused him to turn to cars, marijuana and to be unable to cope with the pregnancy of his wife and the animosity and threats from her family. 
    35 The psychiatrist has expressed the view that he has a dependent personality, which is unable to cope with deep emotional difficulties. That would seem entirely consistent. 
    36 His parents' health is, at the moment, of deep concern to him and he is attempting to repair the alienation that he had from his father. The psychiatrist expresses the view that he is in very strong need of ongoing and intensive therapy. He has apparently grieved for himself, his family, the deceased and the deceased's family. It is suggested that, without therapeutic intervention, there is not so much a risk of further offending as further depression and possibly suicidal behaviour. 
    37 I recommend that during his time in custody, he be afforded such psychiatric or psychological assistance as can be provided to him in order to deal with the problems referred to in the report and that a copy of these remarks and the report be provided to the Corrective Services authorities. 
    38 The report concludes with looking at his prognosis. It indicates that, in the event that his parents die before he is released, he is likely to become seriously depressed and that he is likely to experience a breakdown of his emotional relationships. In particular, action on the recommendation I have made should have regard to any such event as that producing a result which would cause him to suffer the consequence the psychologist refers to. I also have regard to these matters as affecting the effect of the sentence on him as more onerous than it might otherwise be. 
    39 I have already, when they were tendered to me, treated the victims impact statements I have received in accordance with the law and made such comment as is appropriate having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Previtera (1998) 94 A. Crim. R. 76 on them. 
    40 I have regard to the Crown's submissions and, in particular, to that aspect of the Crown's submissions which emphasises that every case of homicide, including manslaughter, involves the unlawful death of a human being and, as a consequence, such cases are to be treated by the courts as most serious. The court is required to give consideration to a sentence which will reflect the objective culpability of what the offender has done which will denounce the crime, which will, so far as is consistent with a particular case, deter the offender and operate to deter others from committing such crimes. 
    41 In this case, bearing in mind the concatenation of circumstances that unfortunately led to the death of the deceased, there is a most limited role for general deterrent to play. Although there is some role for specific deterrent, I do not find there is any likelihood that the offender would re-offend if he is properly treated whilst in custody.  
    42 However, he must be sentenced to a punishment appropriate to the crime. Nonetheless, the law mitigates the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for objective criminality of this sort by having regard to the particular circumstances of the offender and how it was the offender came to commit the crime. 
    43 It is necessary one has regard for the offender's surrounding circumstances, particularly when it comes to considering the important matter on sentence of protection of the community to ascertain whether the offender is a person of whom there may be real prospect for rehabilitation and for one to have regard to the subjective circumstances of the offender which are set out in the report from Mr. Kesby-Smith when ascertaining what it was that moved him in the circumstances in which he was then placed to do the dreadful thing he did. 
    44 In manslaughter, of all crimes, there is the widest of possible ranges of penalty, stretching from a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment down. Courts have remarked on the broad range of circumstances that can give rise to the commission of a crime of unintended killing, which is what this offender has committed. It is never possible to compare individual cases such as to be able to extract a direct correspondence of sentence so that the relevant sentence will precisely accord with that passed in some other case. The role of a sentencing judge is to sentence according to law and to pass a sentence having regard to that range of sentences judges have produced when considering crimes of the same nature, same general nature, such that one can ascertain that the sentence will fit with the general range of sentences approved by the courts. 
    45 In that regard, the Crown has provided to me a survey of some cases. There has been some debate concerning their appropriateness to allow a range to be fixed. I have, in addition, provided to counsel for the purpose of their assisting me with submissions two decisions, which it seemed to me might, on a proper calculation of how sentence might be made up, rather accord with the effect of the submission made by the Crown concerning the appropriate sentence. 
    46 The sentence here should date from the time at which the accused returned to custody on his plea, that being 18 October 2001. 
    47 The sentence should reflect a discount on consideration of the offender's plea which, in all the circumstances, having regard to the fact that until that date he was charged with murder, in accordance with Regina v. Thompson & Houlton (2000) 115 A. Crim. R. 104, should fall within the range of 10 to 25%. The figure that I would allow, having regard to the necessity for the previous trial and the utility of the plea, is 15%. 
    48 I find, as I have said, some degree of contrition. I find in addition to that that the sentence that should be imposed should reflect the 11 months in custody that the accused had spent and should have some reflection of the period of one year and 11 months, which the accused had spent on conditional but limited liberty. I have regard to that period as being somewhat more onerous than it would otherwise have been since he was, during that time, under the threat of being found guilty of murder. 
    49 In those circumstances, it is incumbent to give consideration to the level of sentence I would have imposed absent those matters and I consider that a head sentence of some nine years would have been appropriate but, having regard to those matters, would impose a head sentence of six years nine months and, finding special circumstances as I do, constituted by his youth, by the appalling tensions upon him which caused him to develop the conditions under which he committed this crime, in particular the depression and the resort to drugs, and conscious that he will require an extended period of supervision, would impose a non-parole period of three years nine months. That allows for an extended parole period of three years during which he may not be released and may remain in custody unless the Parole Board consider that his release during that period is appropriate. 
    50 Mr. Willoughby, would you please rise. You are sentenced to imprisonment for six years and nine months with a non-parole period of three years and nine months. 
    51 I am required by the Act to explain to you your release date. You will not be released prior to 17 July 2005 and unless released by application of parole, will be required to serve your sentence until the conclusion of the six years and nine months to which I have referred.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Giles JA. 
      
       
     2 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Giles JA. 
      
       
     3 GILES JA: The respondent was a passenger on the appellant’s train. The train arrived at Central Railway Station at about 12.35 am on 6 January 1996. The respondent was extremely intoxicated. He and his companion got off the train and began to make their way to the exit from the platform. The station assistant gave the guard the signal for the train to depart, the guard in turn signalled the driver of the train, and the train departed. In unclear circumstances the respondent came in contact with the last carriage of the train as it departed, fell onto the railway tracks at the end of the platform, and was injured.  
      
       
     4 The respondent sued the appellant, alleging in substance that the appellant had failed to take reasonable care for his safety in that, given his intoxication and the proximity of the train, it should not have permitted the train to depart until he had left the platform or should have restrained him as it departed so that he could not come in contact with the train. The duty of care was said to arise in contract under a contract between the appellant as carrier and the respondent as passenger, or alternatively in tort under the general law by virtue of the relationship of carrier and passenger, with a higher duty of care arising in contract than in tort.  
      
       
     5 The proceedings were heard by Herron DCJ. His Honour found that there had been a contract between the appellant as carrier and the respondent as passenger. He did not think that the duties of care materially differed on the facts of the case, and without deciding whether they differed in law held that the appellant had been negligent. His Honour held that for the awarding of damages what befell the respondent was a motor accident within the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (“the Act”), and that by force of its provisions a defence of contributory negligence was available to the respondent’s claim in contract notwithstanding the decision of the High Court in Astley v Austrust Ltd (1999) 197 CLR 1. (The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Assessment Act 2000 was not in force at the time of his Honour’s decision.) He found that the respondent’s self-induced intoxication constituted contributory negligence whereby the damages recoverable should be reduced by one half. He assessed damages of $523,403.50. Accordingly the respondent obtained a judgment against the appellant for $261,701.75. 
      
       
     6 The appellant appealed as to liability and as to most components in the assessment of damages. The respondent cross-appealed as to the application of the Act, specifically the holding that it made a defence of contributory negligence available to the respondents’ claim in contract, and as to the extent of contributory negligence found.  
      
       
        
       Liability 
       
     7 The appellant as carrier owed to the respondent as passenger a duty to take reasonable care for his safety (Maloney v Commissioner for Railways (1978) 18 ALR 147; Public Transport Commission of New South Wales v Perry (1977) 137 CLR 107). The respondent submitted that for his claim in contract the appellant was under a higher duty of care than for his claim in tort, because the appellant impliedly warranted that the platform at Central Railway Station was as safe for his use as the exercise of reasonable skill and care could make it. Whether there is an implied warranty with a higher duty of care is debatable, see Watson v George (1953) 89 CLR 409; Calin v Greater Union Organisation Pty Ltd (1991) 173 CLR 3, and the respondent acknowledged that “it may be to some extent a question of semantics as to whether that standard of care is higher than the duty to exercise reasonable care”. The implied warranty is not a promise of safety, and does not call for more than the exercise of reasonable skill and care. On the facts of this case I am content to assume, without deciding, that there was a duty of care under the implied warranty and to consider the appellant’s liability according to that duty of care.  
      
       
     8 Herron DCJ considered that the appellant’s negligence was through the station assistant who gave the guard the signal for the train to depart. He held that there was no negligence on the part of the guard, because ”[t]he accident probably occurred behind him as the train left the platform and I do not think that he failed to keep a proper lookout”. Referring to the judgment of Mason J in The Council of the Shire of Wyong v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-8, he said that the risk of injury to the respondent was a real risk which would have occurred to the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the station assistant, and that as a reasonable response to the risk the station assistant “should have taken immediate steps when he saw the state in which the plaintiff was, as he alighted from the train, to have ensured that he was put in a position of safety before he signalled the departure of the train”. His Honour considered that there were available personnel “who should have been utilised to remove [the respondent] from the platform or otherwise to ensure that he did not come into contact with the train”, saying that although the station assistant was alone on the platform he could have contacted the Transit Police to come and give assistance. He said that he “rejected” what he described as the suggestion of Mr Hugh Cowling, a witness called for the appellant, that “to take such steps would have caused, in effect, havoc to the transport system”. 
      
       
     9 It is necessary to examine in some detail the circumstances in which the station assistant gave the signal for the train to depart, and so far as it can be ascertained how the respondent came in contact with the train. It became apparent in the hearing of the appeal that the recitation of the facts by Herron DCJ and his Honour’s findings of fact were less full than they could have been, and the examination which follows to some extent goes beyond his Honour’s reasons. This Court can make its own findings of fact and draw its own conclusions from the facts (Warren v Coombes (1979) 142 CLR 531), subject to well-known constraints including respect for the trial judge’s findings and conclusions and in particular recognition of the trial judge’s advantages in seeing and hearing the witnesses (eg Rosenberg v Percival (2001) 75 ALJR 734). I do not think that in the present case those constraints preclude amplification from the evidence before his Honour of the facts to which he referred in his reasons. 
      
       
     10 The respondent and his companion spent some hours in a hotel at Liverpool on the evening of 5 January 1996. The respondent said that he “consumed [a] substantial amount of alcohol”, although he could not recall what he was drinking. He took beer and a bottle of bourbon with him when they left the hotel. They caught a train at Liverpool Station to go to the city to “party on”, and continued to drink in the train.  
      
       
     11 A pharmacologist gave evidence that analysis of a sample of the respondent’s blood taken at the hospital after his injury showed a very high alcohol content of 0.42 gms per cent, and that the respondent was “most likely to have been extremely heavily affected by alcohol shortly before the collision [sic]” and “would have been obviously intoxicated and that this would have been apparent to anyone observing him for more than a few moments”. When examined at the hospital the respondent was found to be “intoxicated, disoriented and combative”.  
      
       
     12 The respondent had no recollection of getting off the train at Central Railway Station, of being on the platform, or apart from what he described as “little flashes” of coming in contact with the train and falling onto the railway tracks. His companion did not give evidence. The little flashes did not contribute to explaining how the respondent came in contact with the train. 
      
       
     13 The train drew into platform 22 at Central Railway Station. The platform is 160 metres long, with exits by two sets of steps going downwards at the northern end and two sets of steps going downwards at the southern end. One of the sets of steps at the southern end of the platform has its entrance from the platform approximately 17 metres from the end of the platform. The other set of steps is at the end of the platform with the entrance to the steps from the platform approximately 4 metres from the end of the platform. For ease of reference I will call these steps 1 and steps 2 respectively. Both sets of steps go downwards to the south. A passenger alighting from a train in the middle of the platform or towards its southern end who intends to leave the platform by the steps at the southern end will walk in a southerly direction to the entrance of one of the sets of steps and then continue in a southerly direction down the steps.  
      
       
     14 A wrought iron balustrade is erected around the sides and rear of the opening in the platform through which steps 1 take their downward course. From the edge of platform 22 to the edge of platform 23, the other “half” of the composite platforms, is a variable distance generally of the order of 9 or 10 metres. The distance between the balustrade and the edge of platform 22 is approximately 3 metres. A pole supporting a roofing structure stands next to the balustrade on the platform 22 side of the order of 1 or 2 metres to the south of the entrance to steps 1. Another pole stands approximately 8 metres further to the south, between the opening through which steps 1 take their downward course and the entrance to steps 2 but a little closer to the edge of platform 22. For ease of reference I will call these pole 1 and pole 2 respectively. 
      
       
     15 A control room stands approximately at the middle of the length of the platform, in and from which the station personnel set the lights on destination boards installed along the platform, play announcements concerning destinations and departures, and otherwise perform their duties. When an eight car train pulls into the platform the guard’s compartment is adjacent to the control room. A station assistant located within the control room normally speaks to the guard, and in due course gives the signal for the train to depart, described as giving right of way to the train. Before doing so the station assistant sees that passengers have got off and got on the train and are not “half in the train”, and when standing on the platform in the vicinity of the control room checks to see that the signal at the end of the platform is green to allow the train to leave, blows a whistle, and shows a white flag as the right of way signal to the guard. The guard signals the driver by a bell and the driver causes the train to depart, but until the automatic doors on the train have closed and the train is in motion the station assistant keeps looking to see whether someone is seeking to get off or get on the train at the last minute. The station assistant remains on the platform, looking up and down the platform, until the last carriage of the train has reached the end of the platform.  
      
       
     16 When the train in which the respondent and his companion were passengers pulled into platform 22 the station assistant, Mr Matthew Bartholomew, was alone in the control room and the only member of the station personnel on the platform. The train was an eight car train. Mr Bartholomew saw some people get off the train, he thought less than ten people. He saw two intoxicated men get off the train either from the northerly end of the third car or from the fourth car, that is, approximately 20 metres to the south of where he was standing outside the control room. He said that they were staggering, which he equated with swaying, and noticeably intoxicated, but when on the platform were walking in a relatively straight line side by side as if they were conversing.  
      
       
     17 Mr Bartholomew said that the men walked towards the middle of the platform, in context meaning its middle in width rather than length, and then turned to their right and walked towards the southern end of the platform. He saw them as they went along the platform in a southerly direction for up to 60 metres. They were keeping out from the train, the distance between the man closer to the train and edge of the platform being two or three metres.  
      
       
     18 Mr Bartholomew went into the control room and played the announcement for the departure of the train, and then returned to the platform. He saw that the two men had continued towards the stairs at the southern end of the platform. When asked whether they were still walking side by side when he last saw them he rather enigmatically answered “possibly”, but said that the man closer to the train was still about 2 metres away from the edge of the platform. Mr Bartholomew saw the two men “fairly close to” or “at” steps 1 and expected them to walk down the steps. He checked the signal, blew the whistle, checked “that it was clear for the train to depart”, and by showing the white flag gave right of way to the train.  
      
       
     19 Mr Bartholomew marked on a photograph the position of the men when he last saw them, which he said was after he had shown the white flag. He said he thought it was “in the vicinity of” and “at the most within 1 or 2 metres of” pole 1, and when asked in what direction the men were walking said “possibly still heading south”; later he said he believed the men “were still walking in the southerly direction”. He was not certain of the steps and pole because of the distance, but the evidence to which I shortly refer tends to confirm his recollection of steps 1 and pole 1. As the train moved away his attention was concentrated on the northern end of the platform, because he considered that a slight curvature in the platform restricting the sight of the train doors to the north made that necessary.  
      
       
     20 Mr Bartholomew was called to give evidence by the respondent. He said that he did not now think that “there was anything that I should have done overly different”, and that he did not agree that he should have “watched [the respondent and his companion] all the way down the stairs”.  
      
       
     21 A minute or so after the train had left Mr Bartholomew was told of someone on the railway tracks. He called for an ambulance and the police and took steps to prevent further trains from arriving at platform 22, and then went to the southern end of the platform. He saw a person on the railway tracks whom he believed was one of the intoxicated men he had earlier seen, and said he saw “his friend still on the platform as well”.  
      
       
     22 The guard, Mr Jasbir Gilhotra, knew nothing of an incident involving the respondent until he was told of it afterwards. He recalled seeing the station assistant, and that the train was given right of way, and said that he “looked both sides that no one is on the way, and then closed the doors”. He said that he “watched the train in the sense that if somebody’s coming – approaching towards me, then I should stop the train in emergency”, and that he did not see any such person. He saw nothing potentially dangerous, and had no recollection of seeing anybody near the southern end of the platform on the occasion in question. It is not entirely clear whether at times Mr Gilhotra was speaking of his routine or of an actual recollection of the occasion, although on balance I think he asserted the latter; Herron DCJ clearly enough took that view. 
      
       
     23 Another station assistant, Mr Nigel South, ceased his duties on platform 16 at Central Railway Station at about midnight on 5-6 January 1996 and was then on cleaning duties, specifically the steps at the southern ends of a number of the platforms. He first went to the steps at the southern end of platform 22 and walked up steps 1. On reaching the platform he turned to walk towards steps 2. He saw two men about half way between pole 1 and pole 2. The two men were walking towards Mr South, that is, in a northerly direction. He greeted them and walked on and down steps 2. A train was standing at the platform, and Mr South said that he saw the driver leaning out the window of his cabin and looking in their direction. Very shortly afterwards Mr South was “alerted to something that was wrong”, he returned to the platform, and saw a man lying on the railway tracks. He told Mr Bartholomew.  
      
       
     24 Mr South was not asked anything about intoxication of the two men he encountered, nor was he asked whether the man he saw on the railway tracks was one of the two men he had encountered. From the evidence to which I next refer, the men were probably the respondent and his companion. 
      
       
     25 Mr Kenneth Franks, the driver of the train, said that he looked out from his cabin immediately after he heard the bell from the guard indicating that the train could depart. He had to lean out the window because he was looking back along the platform. He said that he saw on the platform “two gentlemen that I knew that had been in – on my train behind me”, and that the two men “were standing at the exit stairs”. The two men were standing next to pole 1 about 1 metre in from the yellow line near the edge of the platform, and were standing still. A “station staff” was standing “at the mouth of the stairs” with a hose in his hand, facing the (southern) end of the platform, with the two men facing the station staff and “the centre of the platform”, apparently meaning facing towards the control room. Mr Franks identified the respondent as one of the men he saw. Mr Franks then repositioned himself in his seat and caused the train to depart. He was not asked anything about the intoxication of the two men he saw, and clearly enough did not consider that departure of the train could endanger them. 
      
       
     26 Senior Constable Mark Lang was an officer in the Transit Police on duty on the night of 5-6 January 1996. He was called to platform 22 and saw a man lying on the railway tracks. He “smelt a smell I associate with a person having had large amounts of alcohol”. He observed that the man’s fly was down and there was a wet spot in his groin area. In a report he later wrote he expressed the view that the respondent had “approached the edge of the platform and proceeded to urinate on the passing train”. He spoke to the respondent’s companion, who said that he (the companion) did not see anything, and was “on the other side of the platform” and heard the respondent’s screams. 
      
       
     27 From where the respondent was found on the railway tracks and the nature of his injuries, he must have been at or very near the southern end of the platform and his head or shoulder must have come in contact with the rear portion of the last carriage of the train. The train must have largely cleared platform 22 before the contact occurred. Had the respondent not been at or very near the southern end of the platform or had the contact been closer to the front of the train the respondent could not have ended up where he was found on the railway tracks, at least not without being killed or suffering injuries of a different and much more serious nature. 
      
       
     28 From all these facts, what probably occurred?  
      
       
     29 The respondent and his companion got off the train near the middle of platform 22 and slightly to its southern end. They walked clear of the train, 2 to 3 metres in from the edge of the platform, turned right towards the steps at the southern end of the platform, and walked along the platform for up to 60 metres to near the entrance to steps 1. They were obviously intoxicated and staggering or swaying, but despite their conditions kept clear of the train and walked in a more or less straight line staying 2 to 3 metres from the edge of the platform. 
      
       
     30 For an unknown reason or unknown reasons, the respondent and his companion did not leave the platform by going down steps 1. They went at least some way past the entrance to steps 1, then back in a northerly direction towards the entrance to steps 1. They encountered Mr South, and were seen by Mr Franks at that point, in the vicinity of pole 1. They were still clear of the train, and neither Mr South nor Mr Franks gave any evidence suggesting that to him their condition or position was such that they were at risk if the train departed. 
      
       
     31 It would have taken a little time for Mr Franks to set the train in motion and for the train to have progressed to where the last carriage was nearly clear of the platform. (The time from setting the train in motion to the last carriage clearing the end of the platform was estimated by one expert at 25 seconds.) Whether early in that time or only at its end, and the difference may only have been seconds, the respondent unexpectedly moved to the end and edge of the platform where he came in contact with the last carriage as the train departed. It is possible that he did so in order to urinate from the end or edge of the platform, if so hardly conduct to be expected even of an intoxicated man, but why he did so can not be found with any confidence. 
      
       
     32 On Mr Bartholomew’s evidence he gave the train right of way when the respondent and his companion were at about the entrance to steps 1 and were apparently about to go down the steps. His recollection that they were still walking in a southerly direction appears to conflict with the evidence of Mr South and Mr Franks, because on the latter evidence at the time Mr Bartholomew gave the train right of way they must have been coming back to the entrance to steps 1. Herron DCJ did not refer to or resolve the possible conflict. Mr South and Mr Franks were close to the respondent and his companion, Mr Bartholomew was not certain, and what Mr Bartholomew saw must have been the two men close to pole 1 but not still walking in a southerly direction: it matters little, because they were still close to the entrance to steps 1 and Mr Bartholomew expected them to go down the steps. 
      
       
     33 Neither Mr Bartholomew nor Mr Gilhotra saw what must have been a sudden movement by the respondent to the end and edge of the platform as the train departed. Mr Bartholomew’s attention was on the northern end of the platform, but if Mr Gilhotra saw nothing the sudden movement must have been very late in the time during which the train was set in motion and progressed to where the last carriage was nearly clear of the platform. Herron DCJ’s finding that there was no negligence on the part of the guard because “[t]he accident probably occurred behind him as the train left the platform and I do not think that he failed to keep a proper lookout”, which was not contested by the respondent in the appeal, means that the movement must indeed have been very late as the train left the platform. 
      
       
     34 It is as well to repeat the well known passage from the judgment of Mason J in the Council of the Shire of Wyong v Shirt at 47-8 - 
      
       
        
         
         “In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position.” 
         
        
       
     35 Falling or being dragged beneath the train, or contact with the train without that result, may bring serious injury. Approaching too close to a train as it leaves the platform brings risk of injury, although it will not necessarily do so. People stand and walk close to trains on innumerable occasions without suffering harm. It could not be suggested and was not suggested that, had he not been in his intoxicated state, fulfilment of the duty of care owed to the respondent required that the appellant not permit the train to leave the platform until (in words used by Herron DCJ) he had been “put in a position of safety”, by being removed from the platform or restrained. Restraint was the respondent’s explanation of his Honour’s general reference to otherwise ensuring that he did not come in contact with the train. If that were required in relation to a sober respondent, it would be required in relation to every other passenger getting off a train and every would-be passenger waiting on a platform.  
      
       
     36 Vital to breach of duty in the present case, therefore, is the effect of the respondent’s intoxication on what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the ordinarily remote prospect that a passenger who has got off a train and is making his way towards the exit from the platform will come in contact with the train as it leaves the platform.  
      
       
     37 Given what he observed as to the respondent’s intoxication and conduct, how would a reasonable man in the position of Mr Bartholomew have assessed the probability of occurrence of the risk of the respondent being injured if the train were permitted to depart before he had left the platform (whether voluntarily or by being removed) or without him being restrained to ensure that he did not come into contact with the train? The reasonable man would believe the respondent to be intoxicated, and would see him and his companion staggering or swaying as they walk along the platform. But he would also see that the respondent and his companion have walked clear of the train and are walking 2 to 3 metres in from the edge of the platform, in a more or less straight line. They are taking the appropriate route to the exit from the platform, and have walked up to 60 metres. They are near the entrance to the steps and, whether walking in a southerly direction or in the vicinity of pole 1 returning towards the entrance to the steps, appear to be intending to go down the stairs. There was no evidence from Mr South or Mr Franks from which it may be said that the reasonable man would have concluded that the condition of the respondent and his companion was such that they were at risk from the departure of the train, and Mr Gilhotra saw nothing untoward in his scanning of the platform.  
      
       
     38 In my opinion, the reasonable man would assess as very low the probability of what must have occurred, a sudden and last-second deviation from apparently going down the steps to going to the end and edge of the platform, perhaps to urinate, and so close to the train that the respondent was struck by it. Although obviously intoxicated, the respondent and his companion had shown no sign of such aberrant conduct as Mr Bartholomew saw them walk the 60 metres or so towards the exit from the platform with the apparent intention of leaving via the steps.  
      
       
     39 The reasonable man must then place in the balance the alleviating action said to be required of the appellant. Should it have bundled the respondent off the platform before the departure of the train? Should it have held him immobile until the train had left the platform? We were not referred to anything which entitled the appellant so to interfere with the respondent’s personal liberty, but that would have required personnel to remove or restrain the respondent and any other intoxicated passenger or would-be passenger on the platform before the trains could depart. The burden of employing personnel could be great, because intoxication is not the only circumstance of risk of injury. There are many thousands of passenger journeys each day, by the young and the infirm as well as the intoxicated. I accept that there may be occasions when a railway authority should respond to risk of injury to a passenger or would-be passenger by some form of restraint, if there be authority for the restraint. That would mean that personnel must be available, not necessarily immediately on hand. But a possibly more realistic response in circumstances such as the present is to hold back giving the train right of way until the respondent and his companion have been seen to leave the platform, although that does not seem to have been the basis on which Herron DCJ found the appellant to have been negligent. Perhaps it was implicit in his Honour’s reference to removal of the respondent from the platform, as voluntary departure from the platform would have had a similar effect, and Mr Cowling’s “suggestion” was in substance that holding a train up until intoxicated passengers had left the platform would be “a recipe for chaos and anarchy” for a rail network.  
      
       
     40 Waiting until the respondent and his companion had gone down the steps at the southern end of the platform has an attractive simplicity. But the simplicity is false. If the appellant were required to wait for the respondent to leave the platform, it would be required to wait for every passenger or would-be passenger perceived to be at risk, from youth, infirmity or any other reason as well as from intoxication, voluntarily to leave the platform. It would have to keep any train at platform 23 from leaving as well. Occasional disturbances to regular operations, in the interests of safety, are and must be accepted, but the response presently under consideration would gravely impede the functioning of the rail transport system.  
      
       
     41 It is appropriate at this point to refer to the evidence of Mr Cowling. He was an engineer with particular expertise in rail transport systems and their conduct. He provided a report in which he referred to some overseas practices in giving a train right of way when an intoxicated person was in the vicinity, identified what he described as issues to be addressed “in assessing and controlling any ‘affected’ person(s)”, identified what he described as issues involved “in holding up train movement until all ‘affected’ persons have departed from the platform”, and expressed a “conclusion” on the latter subject.  
      
       
     42 The report was rejected so far as it stated issues on the former subject and some of the issues on the latter subject. The appellant submitted that the rejected portions of the report should not have been rejected. Much of what was stated was not opinion evidence, and I do not think Herron DCJ was obliged to dissect out fragments of fact and opinion of which Mr Cowling was able to give evidence. In any event, I do not think the fate of the appeal is materially affected by his Honour’s ruling. 
      
       
     43 Mr Cowling’s conclusion was what Herron DCJ described as the suggestion which he rejected (in the sense of did not accept). In form it commented on evidence given by Mr William Bailey, who had given evidence for the respondent. It read - 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Bailey has suggested that there should have been a procedure in place, which would have prevented a train departing until such time as ‘drunk’ customers were completely clear of the platform. 
         
        
        
         
         I am sure that Mr Bailey’s suggestion was made in good faith and from the very best of intentions. However, in my opinion, his suggestion is superficial and is nothing but a recipe for chaos and anarchy, in which the entire rail network simply could not operate. 
         
        
        
         
         From an engineering standpoint it is obvious to me, if such a procedure was adopted the entire NSW railway system would have to be redesigned from the ground up. 
         
        
        
         
         The resulting costs would be so high that in my view it would simply not be practicable to continue running train services in NSW. 
         
        
        
         
         The resulting effects of discontinuing train services would result in very significant social breakdown and in my view simply could not be tolerated. 
         
        
        
         
         As I intimated at the beginning of this report, my experience leads me to suggest that there is no comparable heavy rail network in the world that has such a procedure. 
         
        
        
         
         In Part 1, I described the different procedure which operated in New York. My understanding is that in 1996 this was also standard practice in Sydney.” 
         
        
       
     44 In some respects this conclusion may have gone beyond Mr Cowlings expertise. The evidence was admitted over the respondent’s objection, the respondent’s stance being that the case was “not a system case” and “had nothing to do with the railway network”, and Mr Cowling was not cross-examined upon it. With respect to Herron DCJ, in my view it provided a sound foundation for expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking the alleviating action of waiting until an intoxicated passenger or would-be passenger had left the platform before giving a train right of way. 
      
       
     45 Before conducting the balancing exercise of which Mason J spoke, what guidance can be obtained from other cases? It must be remembered that it is a question of fact in the circumstances of the particular case, and regard to other cases may be unhelpful or even misleading. Nonetheless we were referred to a number of decisions, particularly from North America. I will go to those most material to the present case, first those on which the respondent relied. 
      
       
     46 One of the cases did not involve an intoxicated passenger. In Brooks v London Passenger Transport Board (1947) 1 All ER 506 the plaintiff fell out of the open door of a train. It was held that the defendant should have ensured that the doors were closed, and if necessary should have delayed the start of the train so that that could be done even if “the exigencies of the traffic” meant that trains could not stand at stations for more than a short time (according to the report, 35 seconds). The report does not disclose the extent of delay involved, but the initial time was remarkably short and the delay would have been finite. It must have been considered such that, in balancing the impediment to the functioning of the rail transport system against the risk posed by an open door, the former was outweighed by the latter. The finite time needed to close doors does not compare with the more open-ended time in waiting for passengers or would-be passengers to leave the platform, and the circumstances in which delay was called for were different from those of the present case. The risk in the present case requires its own assessment and balancing against the impediment to the conduct of the rail transport system. 
      
       
     47 The other of the cases on which the respondent relied to which I will go were concerned with intoxicated passengers or entrants on railway premises. 
      
       
     48 In Dunn v Dominion Atlantic Railway (1920) 52 DLR 149 the plaintiff boarded a train in a state of intoxication, became disorderly, and misconducted himself in various ways culminating in a violent attack on the train conductor. He was put off the train by the conductor at the next station. It was about 1 am at night, the station was unlit and unattended and the passenger’s intoxication was such that he was seen to stagger and fall when put off the train. The passenger was later found on the railway tracks a little distance from the station, having been struck by another train.  
      
       
     49 It was held by majority that the jury could properly have found, as it had, that the conductor had not exercised due care in putting the passenger off the train. The majority spoke of the “hopelessly drunken condition” of the passenger (per Idington J at 153), of the passenger lying on the railway tracks in a drunken stupor and being in “such an advanced state of intoxication that leaving him where he was placed involved endangering his life because he was unable to take care of himself” (per Anglin J at 155), and of the passenger being left “in his helpless condition where no one can look after him, and where he is in obvious danger of getting on the railway track and being injured or killed by a passing train” (per Mignault J at 158). The facts were quite different from the facts in the present case.  
      
       
     50 In Cincinnati, N O & T P Rly Co v Marrs 119 Ky 954; 85 SW 188 (1905) an intoxicated man was put on a train by his friends, and was found asleep in the train when it arrived at its depot. The railway staff roused him and put him on the station platform. A short while later he was found asleep between the railway tracks in the switch yard, was again roused, and walked off. Later he was found injured on the railway tracks, having apparently again fallen asleep. It was held that the defendant was ”bound to know that … he would again succumb to the benumbing influence of the liquor with which he was intoxicated” (at 189), and that either he should have been seen safely out of the switch yard or particular care should have been taken in running trains through the switch yard. The circumstances were described as “… such as would lead any reasonably prudent person to believe that the passenger was incapable of caring for himself”. Again, the facts are very different from the facts in the present case. 
      
       
     51 In St Louis-San Francisco Railway Co v Simons 176 F 2d 654 (1949) Grimson was found in an intoxicated state lying very close to the railway tracks in the defendant’s railway yards. He said that he was unable to move, and was left where he was. The employee of the defendant who found him told a nearby resident, Simons, who said he would look after Grimson. Both Grimson and Simons were killed when struck by a railway engine operating in the yards. It was held that the jury’s verdict in favour of Grimson was justified on the doctrine of discovered peril, described as the rule that where employees of a railroad company, other than those operating its trains, discover a person, known to them to be so intoxicated or otherwise disabled as to be unable to care for himself, in a position of danger on or near the tracks the railroad company may owe him the duty either to remove him from the place of danger or to exercise at least reasonable care to avoid injury to him from moving trains. Cincinnati, N O & T P Rly Co v Marrs was cited for the rule. Since Simons was also killed, it would seem that the defendant’s fault was not dependent on Grimson’s intoxication but lay in failing to operate the railway engine with due care. 
      
       
     52 The same doctrine of discovered peril, under the rubric of the doctrine of last clear chance, was recognised in Jones v Atlanta-Charlotte Air Line Railway Co 218 SC 537; 63 SE 2d 476; 26 ALR 2d 297 (1951), in which the deceased was wandering drunk on the railway tracks and was run down by a fast moving locomotive. Again the intoxication does not seem to have been particularly significant: the driver of the locomotive did not keep a proper lookout.  
      
       
     53 I do not find these cases helpful, and the other similar cases on which the appellant relied are even less material to the facts in the present case. 
      
       
     54 The appellant placed greatest reliance on Romeo v Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (1998) 192 CLR 431, referring in particular to the judgment of Kirby J at 480-2 and saying that reasonably foreseen intoxication of the plaintiff did not mean that the cliff top had to be fenced. It said that the duty of care owed by an occupier to an entrant did not extend to protecting the entrant from foolhardy or reckless conduct, citing amongst further cases Morgan v Sherton Pty Ltd (1999) 46 NSWLR 141. And it reminded the Court that the standard of care is reasonableness, not perfection, referring in particular to Derrick v Cheung [2001] HCA 48 at [13 ]- 
      
       
        
         
         “Few occurrences in human affairs, in retrospect, can be said to have been, in absolute terms, inevitable. Different conduct on the part of those involved in them almost always would have produced a different result. But the possibility of a different result is not the issue and does not represent the proper test for negligence. That test remains whether the plaintiff has proved that the defendant, who owed a duty of care, has not acted in accordance with reasonable care.” 
         
        
       
     55 The decision depends on the particular facts. Returning to the balancing exercise in the present case, in my opinion the response to be ascribed to the reasonable man in the position of Mr Bartholomew is not that thought by Herron DCJ to have been appropriate, or waiting until the respondent and his companion had gone down the stairs, or doing other than what Mr Bartholomew did.  
      
       
     56 The respondent and his companion, although seen to be intoxicated and staggering, had safely made their way along the platform towards the exit, were near to the entrance to the steps, and appeared to be about to go down the steps. Their conduct at that time does not seem to have awakened in either Mr South or Mr Franks concern that they or either of them were unable to take care for their own safety. Mr Gilhotra did not see anything potentially dangerous. The train was given right of way, and began to leave the platform. Only at the very last, when the train had almost cleared the platform, did the respondent unexpectedly so conduct himself that he came in contact with the train. I do not think that the (assumed) duty of care under the implied warranty required that the appellant remove the respondent from the platform or restrain him, or wait until he had been seen to leave the platform, before giving the train right of way.  
      
       
     57 This is a conclusion on the facts of the present case. It does not mean that a railway authority has unbridled licence to send its trains on their way. A passenger still getting off or getting on the train, a child skylarking near the edge of the platform apparently heedless of the danger of a moving train, or an intoxicated person on the platform obviously unable to control himself and so in a position of danger, all these can be expected to preclude immediately sending the train on its way. There is a line between when a railway authority so conducts itself in sending a train on its way that the platform is as safe for the use of its passengers as reasonable skill and care can make it, and when it does not. The line can not be drawn in the abstract. It must be decided on the facts of each case whether the conduct falls on one side of the line or the other. In my judgment, the present case falls on the appellant’s side of the line. 
      
       
        
       Damages 
       
     58 It is not necessary to deal with the appeal as to the components in the assessment of damages. 
      
       
        
       Contributory negligence 
       
     59 It is also not necessary to deal with the cross-appeal as to the defence and extent of contributory negligence. Since there may be extant other cases in which the availability of the defence of contributory negligence is an issue, however, I consider that I should say something of the opinion of Herron DCJ that the Act made the defence of contributory negligence available to the respondent’s claim in contract.  
      
       
     60 Section 68 of the Act defines “motor accident” as including a transport accident referred to in s 69(2). Section 69(2) provides that Pt 6, which deals with the awarding of damages, applies “to and in respect of an award of damages which relates to the death of or bodily injury to a person caused by or arising out of a transport accident …”. The incorporated concept of a transport accident comes from other legislation. Herron DCJ held that what befell the respondent was a transport accident, and that the awarding of damages was governed by Pt 6 of the Act. There was no appeal from those conclusions. 
      
       
     61 Herron DCJ also held that, because many if not most transport accidents would necessarily involve passengers having a contract with the rail authority, s 69(2) “was clearly intended to cover claims brought for breach of contract and/or negligence”. So far so good, but his Honour stepped from there to the availability of the defence of contributory negligence, apparently because of s 74(1) of the Act. It provides that, with qualifications stated in the remainder of the section, “[t]he common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence apply to claims in respect of motor accidents …”. In my opinion the step was unwarranted. The law as to contributory negligence applies to a claim in contract in respect of a motor accident only to the extent that, according to that law, it applies to a claim in contract. If under the law as declared in Astley v Austrust Ltd contributory negligence was not a defence to the respondent’s claim in contract, the Act did not make the defence available. 
      
       
     62 The appellant submitted that s 74(1) took up the common law and the enacted law as it was understood in 1988 when the Act came into force. I can see no reason why it would take up the law as at a frozen moment of time, and in any event in legal principle the law as declared in Astley v Austrust Ltd was the law in 1988 even though in some quarters it was thought to be otherwise. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
     63 I propose the following orders - 
      
       
       
       1. Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       2. Set aside the verdict and judgment for the plaintiff and in lieu thereof verdict and judgment for the defendant. 
        
        
       3. Respondent pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal and of the trial, and have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act if qualified.

     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff claims that he suffered injury on Friday 22 March 1996 whilst in the employ of the defendant. There is no doubt that an incident occurred shortly before knock-off time which I am satisfied was, on a Friday scheduled for 2 pm. The plaintiff’s recollection of 4 pm is faulty but nothing turns on the precise time. What occurred has been referred to at trial as skylarking and it is convenient to continue so to do. 
    2 The business of the defendant involved the manufacture of surf boards. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he was talking to another employee Lee Jessop about some work which he wished to complete on a board of his own when he “felt this arm wrapping around my throat, cut my wind off and just ripped me backwards and then I fell to the ground”. At the time he felt pain down his throat and in his back. The assailant was Scott King who ran away but later returned. In response to enquiry he told Jessop that he thought he had seriously injured his back. He told King the same thing. King treated the incident as a joke. Jessop had made a comment to the effect that the plaintiff had injured his back and the plaintiff acknowledged that he had.  
    3 It was common ground between counsel that I should approach the question of liability in accordance with that taken by Streatfield J in Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Company Limited 1957 2 All ER 229. Principles to be applied include the recognition of a duty on an employer to remove a source of danger to fellow employees where one employee, by habitual conduct, is likely to prove such a source of danger. Where skylarking takes place an employer is negligent if he fails to maintain discipline and take proper steps to put an end to it. The liability derives from a failure to respond to foreseeable risk and not from isolated incident, nor from reasonable response by way of reprimand or otherwise to a limited number of incidents thus, as Streatfield J observed, the extreme course of dismissal would not be required if suitable instruction is given and it is obeyed. In Hudson, over something like four years there was repeated horseplay by a particular employee who was repeatedly reprimanded without effect and there was an express observation that if it was not put an end to someone would be injured as eventually Mr Hudson was. 
    4 The plaintiff was employed by the defendant in January 1996 and, subject to what might be derived from cross examination of certain of the witnesses called for the defendant, the entirety of the plaintiff’s case concerning undisciplined skylarking at the factory was dependent upon his own testimony. His evidence in chief was: 
     
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you arrived at Burford Reinforced Plastics, did you notice any skylarking going on in the factory? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. A lot of tomfoolery going around in that factory. 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        Q. Would you just give us an idea of what sort of tomfoolery was going on? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. Lot of skylarking, such thing they designed, it was a resin ball and they used to peg it around the factory at newcomers and, you know, anyone that was in the factory area bore a resin ball or they just were not part of it. 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        Q. Any other physical sort of skylarking? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. Some wrestles in the stringer room, can’t really see in the stringer room because it is just boxed off. 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        Q. Well, did anybody by way of foreman or the boss ever say anything about that prior to the day of your accident? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. Mike used to tell us on occasions to stop tomfooling around but nobody really paid much attention to Mike because he didn’t really care much. He wanted production to get put out.

        Q. Was he the one who used to say ‘cut it out’ from time to time?

        Q. Did he say anything more than just say ‘cut it out’? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. Not necessarily, no. 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        Q. Ever threaten everyone with the sack? 
        
       
      
      
      
       
        
        A. He threatened everybody kind of with the sack but he didn’t go through with it. ” 
        
       
      
      
    5 The plaintiff’s credibility on all issues was the subject of intense challenge but before turning to matters relevant to that and to testimony contradictory of the plaintiff I should deal with the threshold bar to action which was pleaded by the defendant. 
    6 Section 182D of the Workers Compensation Act 1990 (Queensland) (the Act) provides: 
     
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A worker who has not received an offer of lump sum compensation under section 132 may seek damages at law for an injury suffered after the commencement only if the Board gives to the worker a certificate under this section.” 
        
       
      
      
    7 The defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff has “failed to comply” with that provision.  
    8 Apparently in proof of compliance, the plaintiff tendered a document (Exhibit A) headed “Notice of Assessment”. It notes a determination of a degree of permanent impairment of five percent and invites election by the worker (the plaintiff) to accept, reject or defer a coordinate offer of lump sum compensation. It would seem from the content that the plaintiff is not a worker who has not received an offer of lump sum compensation. Somewhat cryptically however, the centre of the document is endorsed with the line “this is a non certificate injury”. The document appears to be signed by a person described as “Claims Liability Officer”, is dated 7 January 1998 and, as I have said, offers a lump sum. There is no express statement that the document is issued on behalf of the board pursuant to any resolution or delegation. There is no completion on the document suggesting an election by the plaintiff, however the print attached to available “tick boxes” for rejection or deferral includes cautions that rejection entitles seeking damages at law and that if deferral is selected, negotiation for or commencement of action for damages at law will trigger withdrawal of the lump sum offer. 
    9 There is no reference to s182D on the form but submissions by counsel on both sides assumed that the document was such a certificate. As I have pointed out it does not on its face purport to emanate from or be issued on behalf of the Board and it does in fact offer a lump sum presumably pursuant to s132. I do not have convenient access to any regulation and, in the circumstances, will act upon counsel’s common assumption for the purpose of ruling on this aspect of defence even though I have difficulty identifying Exhibit A as a certificate such as appears to be contemplated by s182D. Perhaps it represents an effort by the relevant bureaucracy to administer the statutory requirement. 
    10 The argument advanced by the defendant was limited to contending that the “certificate” was vitiated by fraud. 
    11 It is an agreed fact that on 28 May 1999 the plaintiff was convicted before an Industrial Magistrate in Queensland of an offence charged in terms that “between 21st November 1996 and 15th March 1997 at Palm Beach he defrauded the Workers Compensation Board of Queensland”. Further agreed is the circumstance that this conviction followed a retrial on a slightly amended charge, there having been an earlier finding that the plaintiff had no case to answer which finding was overturned on an appeal by the prosecutor. 
    12 It was not suggested that any proceedings had been taken in any jurisdiction seeking to set aside or otherwise invalidate the Notice of Assessment. Nevertheless it was contended on behalf of the defendant that I should hold that the conviction prevented the certificate from being efficacious in enabling the plaintiff to fulfil the condition precedent to commencement of action. 
    13 I reject that submission. Further assuming (in the absence of evidence to connect them) that the conviction relates to the same subject matter as the “certificate” the latter would operate to fulfil the condition precedent enshrined in s182D until it ceased to be such a certificate. I note that what is required is no more than that the Board “gives to the worker a certificate under this section”. While it exists, the worker may, in terms of the provision, seek damages at law. There are, as I have pointed out, problems about the “certificate” and s182D but on the issue as chosen by the parties the defendant must fail. I would be concerned about dealing with the matter on this basis if it were central or even critical to the outcome of the litigation but having regard to my conclusion on other matters it is not. 
    14 I return to the primary question of the liability of the defendant for alleged skylarking by King. The occurrence of the incident is not in dispute although some of the detail is. Some attention was directed to whether the crook of King’s arm grasped the plaintiff at the level of the throat or the chest and whether the pair fell all the way to the floor or made a deep backwards plunge, reminiscent on one demonstration of the more acrobatic displays of tango dancers. The question is whether the physical act perpetrated by King resulted in injury to the plaintiff. 
    15 As the evidence extracted above reveals, the principal activities which might be classified as skylarking relied upon by the plaintiff were throwing of resin balls and wrestling in the stringer room together with a lot of undefined “tomfoolery”. 
    16 Mr Burford the factory owner denied that he had ever observed wrestling, in the stringer room in particular, nor had resin balls been thrown in the factory. In cross examination he acknowledged that disposable cotton gloves used by workers were “balled” and wrapped in masking tape but said these were used for cricket at lunch time. He acknowledged a letter dated 4 April 1996 to the Workers Compensation Board signed by him which included the statement “Yes, there had been some skylarking on Monday 22nd March” but he said he defined skylarking as merriment. His son, Darren Burford worked at the factory but was not asked questions on this issue. 
    17 Michael Jessop was the factory manager. As a witness he impressed as being balanced and truthful and I accept his testimony. He denied any knowledge of wrestling and pointed out that the stringer room contained a bandsaw which operated virtually continuously and that there were limited personnel who had occasion to be in that room. He denied that skylarking took place in the glue up room (where the incident occurred on 22nd March) but said there was certainly an amount of jocularity among the predominantly young staff. No resin balls had ever been thrown but he had reprimanded people for throwing the “balled” gloves. These were made of rubber with cotton liners. Following his reprimand he observed the practice to cease. 
    18 Andrew Brown was a worker and has since become a supervisor. He denied that physical “mucking around” took place at the factory but agreed that people joked with each other. He had been an employee for about a month before the plaintiff’s incident and on a couple of occasions had seen the disposable gloves “balled” and thrown. He said that if you got seen doing it you were “told off”. In cross examination he denied that King had a reputation as a bit of a larrikin in the sense of coming up and shoving people in the back. 
    19 King was the assailant. A letter (4th April 1996) and a statement (2nd May 1996) to the Workers Compensation Board are in evidence. In the former he stated that he had walked up behind the plaintiff, “put my left arm around his neck in a friendly manner, but to my surprise Brett fell into my arms quicker than I thought” and in the latter “I saw him talking to Lee Jessop and I was walking by so I decided to joke with him by grabbing him around the neck. Whilst doing this I said ‘get back to work’ jokingly.” 
    20 Save obviously this incident he said that there was no physical mucking around at the factory but cotton gloves which were destined for a bin were thrown around sometimes with a bit of tape around them. He denied that he even knew what a resin ball was. 
    21 Lee Jessop (the son of the factory manager) was employed as a surfboard maker. In response to cross examination about mucking around in the factory before the accident he said that “things were pretty tight”. He had seen the “balled” gloves thrown a few times but it was “stomped on” by his father. He did not see this occur thereafter. He disputed a proposition that King had a reputation as “a bit of a clown”. He was not asked about resin balls. 
    22 It had been suggested in cross examination that the Burford family had developed something of an obsession about this claim which was believed to have potential to affect the amount of workers compensation insurance premium. A woman, identified as Mrs Burford, was in court for a time apparently taking notes and there was evidence that she had attended the prosecution hearings involving the charge against the plaintiff abovementioned. It was suggested to Mr Jessop Snr that she had said to him when he was returning to the courtroom on one occasion “Don’t forget what I told you about the resin” which exchange Mr Jessop emphatically denied. There was suggested to be a curious coincidence in a number of witnesses estimating the occasions of the cotton gloves being thrown at twice, however no submission was ultimately advanced that I should find that there had been any conspiracy to present falsehoods or that there had been subornation of witnesses. The behaviour and reported interest of Mr and Mrs Burford is perhaps unusual and even if, as suggested, it is to be categorised as obsessive it provides no sound basis for rejection of evidence of the witnesses who happened to be their employees. The submission was that I should prefer the plaintiff as a more credible witness. 
    23 I reject the plaintiff’s contention that resin balls were thrown in the factory as I also reject his assertion that there had been at any time wrestling in the stringer room which is, as I have observed, the location of an operating bandsaw. Insofar as the plaintiff seeks to make a case out of the evidence emerging from witnesses that there were occasions upon which “balled” gloves were thrown, I accept the evidence that the practice was the subject of admonition and that it ceased. 
    24 I am satisfied that the action of King in grasping the plaintiff was an isolated physical act for which I find the defendant is not vicariously liable. 
    25 That finding will result in judgment for the defendant and there is strictly no need to analyse other evidence, but having regard to the extensive canvass in the course of hearing, I should make some references to other matters. 
    26 The plaintiff has a spondylolisthesis at the lumbo-sacral level. Whether this is literally congenital or derives from something in early childhood does not matter. The condition probably rendered his back vulnerable. Radiology has suggested slippage of lumbar disc 5 upon sacral disc 1 which, if one were to accept the plaintiff’s history of onset and continuation of symptoms, may have been precipitated by the incident. From time to time the plaintiff has been seen to manifest spasm in the paraspinal area during medical examinations. I accept that he did make a complaint of pain at the time of the incident on 22nd March. 
     
      
    27 However, if the plaintiff is suffering symptoms in the back to any significant degree, I am unable to determine that they are consequent upon the particular incident. There is very powerful evidence that on the very next day, he carried a child on his hip for an extended period of time and then transported the child and a 22 kilogram drum of resin from a sales area to his utility. I do not accept that the plaintiff at that time was suffering any symptoms worthy of note. 
     
      
    28 Thereafter, in contradiction of any radiological or clinical opinion, there has been accumulated and presented a considerable volume of evidence concerning the absence of any apparent inhibition upon any activity in which the plaintiff chooses to engage. I see no reason not to accept the evidence that the plaintiff was seen surfing post accident at Currumbin but more destructive to the credibility of his claims of serious pain and disability is the product of covert observation manifest in video recordings. 
     
      
    29 Nowhere on any of the film of the plaintiff taken over a wide span of time does he appear to show any sign of disability or guarding against provocation of pain. Amongst other things the plaintiff is seen leaping from the back of his utility, fetching and carrying, squatting to check tyre pressures, entering and exiting vehicles, turning, bending, and lifting. The quantity of film is substantial and was taken on a variety of occasions. The longer it is viewed, the more convincing is the defendant’s proposition that the plaintiff is fit and indeed athletic.  
     
      
    30 Despite the potential of the radiologically detected underlying condition, I am unpersuaded that the plaintiff is afflicted by pain which is in any way significantly disabling. I believe that the plaintiff is on occasions conscious of some back irregularity and I accept the evidence of Michael Jessop that when applying with employment with the defendant the plaintiff explained that he wished to give up concreting for that reason. 
     
      
    31 Nevertheless the plaintiff has, post accident, sought and obtained work as a concreter. Miss Druitt and Mr Adams were entirely independent witnesses in the sense that it could not even be suggested that they owed any employee loyalty to the defendant. I accept their evidence. The evidence of Miss Druitt concerning the plaintiff’s manipulation and installation of railway sleepers was convincing evidence that the plaintiff is fit and strong. 
     
      
    32 The totality of this evidence is so contradictory of the plaintiff’s claims of disability that I am unable to give credence to them. I do not accept the plaintiff’s explanation that he was in effect suffering in silence. The plaintiff’s lack of credibility on issues of damage fortifies me in preferring the evidence of other witnesses on the issue of liability. 
     
      
    33 Pursuant to s183(1) of the Act the legal liability of the defendant is reduced by the amount of compensation paid to the plaintiff. It was agreed that the relevant amount was $31,188.59 and that it should be treated as a defence of payment as pleaded and not as a pro tanto satisfaction of any judgment. Assuming that the plaintiff did experience some immediate symptom as he complained at the time of incident it was in my view no more than transient and had passed by the following day when he carried the child and a large can of resin. There is no medical evidence to suggest that that ability (appearing uninhibited to observers) could be explained by some delay in the onset of symptoms. Provisional assessment of damages would not exceed the amount available as a defence. 
     
      
    34 I direct entry of judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the defendant’s costs of action. **********

      BORAL TRANSPORT LIMITED v WHITEHEAD & ORS 
       
     On 12 August 1998, the first respondent was injured when the coal truck he was driving overturned while making a sharp right hand turn. The first respondent was employed by the appellant to move coal from a mine operated by the second respondent to a rail terminal. The first respondent commenced proceedings in the District Court against both the appellant and the second respondent. He alleged that the second respondent was negligent in that it had loaded the coal into the truck unevenly. The appellant was claimed to have been negligent in failing to heed warnings that the trucks were being loaded incorrectly, and in failing to train him to drive the particular type of truck in a safe manner. The trial Judge found both the appellant and the second respondent liable in negligence, and awarded the first respondent the sum of $514,603.27. The appellant was found to bear 70 per cent of the liability, and the first respondent 30 per cent. The plaintiff was found to have been guilty of contributory negligence in taking the corner too fast, and the award was reduced by 10 per cent. The Workers Compensation Act 1987 affected the calculation of damages recoverable from the appellant. The appellant challenged the findings of the trial Judge as to breach of duty, causation, apportionment and damages. The second respondent filed a notice of cross appeal challenging the finding that it had breached its duty by loading the truck unevenly. The first respondent filed a notice of cross appeal on the ground that the trial Judge had made mathematical errors in the calculation of the judgment sum.Held: per Sheller JA, Stein and Heydon JJA agreeing:1. There was sufficient evidence on which the trial Judge might reasonably conclude that the truck was unevenly loaded at the time of the accident. Therefore the second respondent's cross appeal should be dismissed.2. The trial Judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant had breached its duty of care to its employee. The risk involved in driving an unevenly laden vehicle around a sharp corner was considerable, and could easily have been avoided by warning the driver to take such corners at a speed well below 30 kilometres per hour.3. The trial Judge was entitled to conclude that this breach on the part of the appellant was causative of the injury suffered. Although the trial Judge did not expressly address this question, it cannot be doubted that, if warned of the danger, the first respondent would have taken the corner more carefully. 4. No ground was shown for interfering with the apportionment of liability, or for increasing the amount of the deduction for contributory negligence. The appellant's culpability was greater than that of the second respondent, not only because of its position as employer, but also because it was aware that the vehicles were being loaded unevenly, and took no steps to remedy this. 5. The awards in relation to both non economic and economic damages were based on sound reasoning and were well within the appropriate range.6. The first respondent's cross appeal in relation to the calculation of the damages was upheld. The trial Judge ought to have entered judgment for the full amount against each of the defendants, who then had a right of contribution against each other.

       Introduction 
       
     1 At about 8.57 pm on the night of 12 August 1998 Terry John Whitehead was badly injured when a coal truck he was driving overturned while negotiating a right-hand turn onto a road known as the ICI Haul Road which led to the Ravensworth Coal Terminal in the Hunter Valley. Mr Whitehead was driving the truck which comprised a prime mover and two attached trailers loaded with coal for delivery to the rail terminal. A short distance before the accident the truck which was travelling from Muswellbrook, had turned left from the New England Highway into Pikes Gully Road and then began to turn right into the ICI Haul Road. At the point of the accident the ICI Haul Road was reverse cambered down to the left and against the turn to the right that was being made. The average camber was –4.2 per cent. The road was so cambered to allow water and coal dust to be washed off.  
      
       
     2 The configuration of the prime mover (Fleet No 5409) and two trailers was described as a B-double vehicle. The bins were U shaped (the UBTS configuration) and to be distinguished from square shaped or mouthed bins used on other such trailers. According to an expert consulting engineer, Russel K Findlay, the trailers were unique in that they side tipped and, due to the design of the body, had no side gates. They relied on the shape of the body to dispose of the load. They were also unique in having a very high centre of gravity compared with other types of tipping trailers and in particular side tipping trailers. Mr Whitehead was driving the coal truck as an employee of the second defendant and appellant, Boral Transport Limited (Boral). The coal had been loaded into the trailers by the first defendant, second respondent and second cross-appellant, Muswellbrook Coal Company Limited (Muswellbrook).  
      
       
     3 In 1998 Mr Whitehead began proceedings in the District Court against Muswellbrook and Boral. He alleged against Muswellbrook in substance, that it had incorrectly loaded coal into “the trailer” causing it to be excessively loaded to the near side and had failed to warn him that the load was placed in an incorrect and unsafe manner prior to his leaving the point of loading and travelling from Muswellbrook’s premises. Mr Whitehead alleged against Boral that it had failed properly to instruct him to check that the load in the vehicle was level and stable at all material times, failed to heed warnings by its employees that the loader operating at the premises of Muswellbrook was incorrectly loading trucks thereby causing a risk of injury to the operators of the trucks, and failed properly to instruct him in the use of B-double haulage vehicles, in particular during haulage operations from the premises of Muswellbrook. He alleged Boral failed to instruct him to drive at speeds not exceeding certain limits during his right-hand turn on to the ICI Haul Road.  
      
       
        
       Decision at First Instance 
       
     4 The proceedings were heard by Judge Sidis who gave judgments on 11 and 14 December 2000. On 14 December her Honour pronounced a verdict and judgment “for the plaintiff in the sum of $514,603.27 payable as to 30 per cent, that is $125,217.78 by the first defendant and as to 70 per cent, $389,385.49 by the second defendant.” This requires explanation. Different methods were appropriate to calculate the damages awarded against each defendant. The Workers Compensation Act 1987 (the Act) affected the calculation of the damages recoverable from Boral and to an extent by force of s151Z(2) the damages recoverable from Muswellbrook. The Act capped Boral’s liability for damages for non-economic loss (s151G) and prescribed a discount rate of 5 per cent in assessing damages for future economic loss (s151J). The damages after deducting 10 per cent for contributory negligence awarded against Muswellbrook were $660,419.28 and against Boral of $556,264.99. The calculation which reduced the verdict to $514,603.27 broken up into separate portions against each defendant was erroneous. This and other errors of calculation were pointed out in Mr Whitehead’s notice of cross-appeal and it will be necessary to return to them. 
      
       
     5 The trial Judge found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence on the basis that he took the corner at excessive speed for the conditions and reduced the award by 10 per cent. The defendants were to pay Mr Whitehead’s costs of the proceedings in the same proportions, the proportion payable by Muswellbrook to be assessed on the party/party basis, the proportion payable by Boral on an indemnity basis.  
      
       
     6 Each defendant cross-claimed against the other. There was also a cross-claim by Boral against AMP General Insurance Limited, with which we are not concerned. Boral has appealed and Muswellbrook cross-appealed to this Court. 
      
       
        
       Issues and Evidence 
       
     7 Mr Whitehead was born in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1965. He migrated to Australia in 1988. He married in 1992 and at the time of the accident he and his wife had one child and another on the way. He started working for Boral in February 1996 as a casual truck driver later becoming a full time and permanent employee. Before he started driving heavy vehicles he was issued with a manual of operating procedures.  
      
       
     8 On 12 May 1998 Boral wrote to Mr Whitehead as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “This letter is written confirmation of the verbal warning given to you by myself. This warning relates to an incident which occurred at Wambo Open Cut on the night shift of the 4th May 1998, whereby, you lost control of your vehicle, fleet number 5017. 
          
          
         As you are aware you must drive your truck to the conditions of the road at that time. By your admission, there was no change to the surface or conditions of the road. 
          
          
         Over the last two weeks there has been a marked problem with your driving; from bogging your truck which caused substantial damage to the truck, to a broken tail shaft. Your driving performance will be monitored and you will be sent for driving training and assessment with our Driver Trainer, Mr Chris Wells.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       By May 1998 Boral was on notice that there had been a problem with Mr Whitehead’s driving which required monitoring, assessment and training. It is not clear that this occurred.  
        
       
     9 Judge Sidis said the issues to be determined in the case were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. What caused the truck which the plaintiff was driving to overturn? The options being: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The negligence or contributory negligence of the plaintiff by driving at excessive speed in the circumstances; or, 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The negligence of the first defendant in loading coal unevenly into the double trailers of the trucks; or, 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The negligence of the second defendant in providing an unsafe system of work for the plaintiff in that it did not adequately train him in the operation of the truck which he was driving, or that it did not adequately instruct him as to the conditions of the route which he took at the time of the accident, or that there was an absence of speed warning signs which would have alerted the plaintiff to the need to take extra caution at the point where his truck overturned. 
         
        
        
         
         2. There arises an issue that, if I find more than one of those parties responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries, I have to determine the proportions in which liability is to be dealt with. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The claim brought against the first defendant is to be determined on Common Law principles. As against the second defendant I have to take into account the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1987. 
         
        
        
         
         4. There are mutual cross-claims between the first and second defendants and in addition the second defendant has claimed against AMP General Insurance Limited as its third party insurer, pursuant to the Motor Accidents Act 1988. This raises the issue of whether the accident was the result of the fault of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle in the use or operation of the motor vehicle.” 
         
        
       
       
       The causal link between negligence and injury is not mentioned. Paragraph 2 suggests it was assumed.  
        
       
     10 The claim against Muswellbrook was to be determined on common law principles. The claim against Boral required consideration to be given to the provisions of the Act. 
      
       
     11 Mr Whitehead held the necessary licence to drive a heavy vehicle and had had experience in truck driving in England before coming to Australia. Judge Sidis thought that his experience in England had been limited to non-articulated vehicles but he gave evidence that he had experience taking single trailers across the water to France and Spain though not on a regular basis. He said: “You don’t have B-doubles or road trains in England or Europe.” Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Initially the plaintiff was employed as a semi-trailer driver, that is driving a truck which comprised a prime mover with a single trailer. He was trained in May 1996 to drive the B-double vehicle, that is a prime mover with two trailers. His training comprised one day of driving B-double trailers with side tipping bins. According to the plaintiff he had driven B-double trailers for short periods between 1996 and 1998 but he mainly drove the semi-trailer type truck. He agreed that he had driven a B-double trailer with bins of a different type to that which he was driving at the time of his accident for most of June 1998. He also agreed that he had driven a truck with a B-double trailer of the type which overturned for most of July and up to the date of his accident. He stated however that the first time that he had driven this particular type of B-double trailer on the route upon which the accident occurred was on 12 August 1996, the date of his accident.” 
          
         
        
       
     12 This statement was partly inaccurate. Mr Whitehead said that the B-double trailer he was driving for most of June 1998 had bins of the UBTS configuration on trailers that were attached to the prime mover at the time of the accident. For most of July he was driving the prime mover Fleet No 5409 which was involved in the accident. On the night in question his shift began at 4 pm on the afternoon and would have continued until 4 am the next morning. He had not driven prime mover Fleet No 5409 with the UBTS configuration on the ICI Haul Road before that shift. However, during the shift he had delivered two or three loads using this prime mover and the UBTS configuration over the road without incident. 
      
       
     13 Judge Sidis described the loading procedure. The drivers of the trucks lined up at the stockpile and moved along in line to be loaded by front-end loaders driven by Muswellbrook’s employees. The truck drivers waited until their vehicles were loaded and took no part in the loading operations. 
      
       
     14 On 12 August 1998 the load operators were loading from the right. Mr Whitehead said he noticed that the load operators were loading the coal into the left-hand side of the vehicles rather than into the centre. He said he complained through his CB radio to Keith Goodbun, a senior Boral employee. The purpose of his complaint was to seek to have the coal operators amend their behaviour and load into the centre of the trailers. According to Mr Whitehead there was no change in the method of their operations. He said he was not able to see from the ground or from his position in the cabin the manner in which his own trailers had been loaded because the tops of the bins were high off the ground. Evidence from a fellow employee, Anthony Mark Waters, who was working as a truck driver at the time of this accident, made it clear that there was no ladder available by which Mr Whitehead could have climbed up to view the state of his load and whether or not it was unevenly loaded. 
      
       
     15 Mr Whitehead drove from the loading area to the weighbridge where it was noted that his load was slightly underweight but not sufficiently so to require that he return to the stockpile to be topped up. He then left the site of the mine and travelled towards the coal loader. He travelled over a fairly rough road onto the New England Highway and then in due course turned left from the New England Highway into Pikes Gully Road. He was unable to cut the corner because of the position of some trees at the turn. There were no warning signs or speed advisory signs at the site of his accident. He had been given no instructions concerning the minimum speed at which he should travel through the left and then the right-hand bend in order to access the ICI Haul Road. He had no warning the truck was about to roll over before it rolled except that he heard a creaking or cracking noise immediately before it did so.  
      
       
     16 Mr Waters gave evidence about the loading method and problems relating to uneven loading. He said there were means of knowing whether the load was uneven. A colleague in a line might warn a driver through the CB radio that his load was uneven. On occasions the loader operators themselves might advise a driver. Dennis Frederick Day, a former plant operator employed by and called by Muswellbrook to give evidence, confirmed that on occasions he informed the driver that his load was uneven. Finally it might be possible to detect an uneven load through the behaviour of the truck itself which would display characteristics of instability or not running true on the road. The unevenness could be rectified by applying brakes or by tipping the vehicle or, in most cases, by climbing a ladder to the bins and redistributing the load by means of a shovel. Mr Waters agreed that the load might also settle during the path of travel from the mine to the terminal.  
      
       
     17 The coal, which was being loaded, was granular and not in large lumps. Mr Waters said if it was wet it stuck together “like glue” and it then became very difficult to move the load if it had been placed unevenly in the trailers. Mr Waters said that it had rained for about one and a half weeks before 12 August 1998 and the coal that was being loaded on that date was very wet. On 12 August at the time of the accident it was fine and dry.  
      
       
     18 Mr Waters also said that he spoke to Mr Goodbun as well as Russell Brown, a shift foreman, and by CB radio at least three times to each of the two loader operators. He said he asked them to load the coal into the centre of the trailers and they told him they would see what they could do. The situation did not improve. Boral’s rules required the drivers to contact a supervisor if they were concerned about the stability of their loads. Mr Waters said that on complaining to Mr Goodbun he was told that he would have to keep going. 
      
       
     19 Mr Goodbun was not called to give evidence and there was no explanation for his absence from the court which the trial Judge regarded as significant. 
      
       
     20 Muswellbrook called one of the two loader operators, Grahame Newton, who said although he remembered the night in question he did not remember any complaint having been made. He said he did receive occasional complaints concerning the unevenness of loading and would work with the drivers on it. He said that a number of complaints on one night would be unusual. He agreed that if a load was uneven it could cause instability in a truck and therefore a complaint would be justifiable. Mr Day insisted he had received no complaints that night and said he had never received any complaint in the course of twenty-nine years in Muswellbrook’s employment. He said that the CB radios used by the drivers and the loader operators were consistently used by the drivers talking “a lot of rubbish” and he did not listen to those conversations. 
      
       
     21 Mr Whitehead said that he noticed no instability on the journey between the loader and the site of his accident and that the characteristics of his truck had been the same as on the two or three previous trips that night. The only difference was that on the occasion of the accident he heard a noise when the truck rolled over. According to Mr Waters, movement of a load can make a creaking or clunking noise whether the load is wet or dry. Mr Whitehead was asked whether he came out of Muswellbrook’s premises knowing that the load had been improperly put into his trailer. He responded: “No, I didn’t know it was put all to one side”. 
      
       
     22 Muswellbrook’s position was that the speed of travel was the critical factor in causing the accident. The truck carried an onboard monitoring system which recorded the speed. At the time of the accident the speed of Mr Whitehead’s vehicle was at 30 or 31 kilometres an hour. The evidence was that a difference of one or two kilometres an hour in a situation such as the one in which Mr Whitehead found himself could be critical to the difference between the safe negotiation of a bend in the road and catastrophe. Mr Whitehead said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Most people don’t go by speedometers ……they know the speed they are going by the gear that they are in, and I was in the right gear that I thought that I’d changed – I had the same gear at the same time on all the previous loads to go round the corner.” 
         
        
       
     23 Boral undertook an investigation. As a result it formed the view that Mr Whitehead took the right-hand bend at excessive speed. When he returned to employment on 7 October 1998 he was handed a letter of termination (Exhibit K) in these terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “An investigation was conducted to determine the root cause of the accident. This investigation included controlled speed tests and analysis of information from computer generated reports from the Fleetcom on board monitoring system, vehicle maintenance logs and interviews with mechanical staff and senior company drivers, an independent mechanical inspection and statements from you with regard to the accident. 
          
          
         The accident investigation team found that the B-double 5409 which you were driving at the time of the accident was travelling at a speed which was too fast to attempt the right turn on the line of entry attempted. The investigation team was also of the view that the vehicle was on the wrong line of entry to attempt to negotiate the turn. 
          
          
         Mechanical inspections found no evidence of mechanical malfunction with unit 5409 or its trailers. 
          
          
         Therefore this accident occurred due to driver error. The B-double sustained approximately $100,000 damage. As such driving actions by you constitute serious misconduct, your employment was terminated without notice as of 21 September 1998.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       In this letter Boral’s concern for the damage to its truck was not matched by any concern for the serious injury suffered by its employee. 
        
       
     24 Mr Whitehead’s response was that he had negotiated the right-hand turn at the same speed and on the same line in the first two or three trips that evening. There was no evidence to the contrary from the computer generated reports from the Fleetcom on board monitoring system which Boral did not tender. Accordingly, Judge Sidis inferred that Mr Whitehead’s evidence on this aspect was accurate. 
      
       
     25 Her Honour reviewed the expert evidence, which included three reports from Mr Findlay who opined that the change in the centre of gravity height had a dramatic effect on the stability of the vehicle, in particular whilst negotiating tight low speed corners. In Mr Findlay’s view, if Mr Whitehead’s trailers had not been loaded evenly, with the load positioned to the left of the trailer, this would have contributed to the accident as the vehicle negotiated the right-hand turn on the reverse cambered road. He stated that with a driver correctly positioned on the right-hand side of the road it required only a small shift in the vehicle’s centre of gravity to cause instability and an accident of the type experienced by Mr Whitehead. His conclusion based upon the computer printout and a view of the accident scene was that speed was not a factor in the accident and that what was relevant was the vehicle’s position on the reverse cambered road and the effect of the load on the vehicle’s stability whilst negotiating that corner. He was highly critical of Boral’s investigation which led to Mr Whitehead’s termination. 
      
       
     26 Muswellbrook relied on a report from Mr Schnerring of Jamieson Foley & Associates. Judge Sidis said that Mr Schnerring not surprisingly minimised the likelihood of any contribution from the uneven loading of the vehicle. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “He relied upon the granular nature of the load and its natural propensity to settle following the turns, bumps and other features of the 25 kilometre route from the loading point to the site of the accident.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       However Mr Schnerring did not appear to be aware of the suggestion that the coal was wet and sticky and that Mr Whitehead’s trailer was slightly underloaded at the time of his accident. Mr Schnerring noted that the critical speed for the vehicle driven by Mr Whitehead at the time of the accident for a normal line through the corner was about 31 kilometres per hour. He was of the view that only a small increase in speed would be required to lead a driver close to the roll limit for a truck. The roll limits would not be expected to be the same for all the trucks in the fleet. The driver moving from one truck with a higher roll limit to another truck with a lower roll limit could inadvertently approach the roll limit by driving through the corner at a speed habitually used for that which was higher. He offered the opinion that appropriate signs and markings could warn and inform drivers of road conditions ahead and guide and control drivers through difficult sections of the road. Even for those familiar with a section of the road, signs and markings act as a reminder. He noted that in this particular case a driver’s speed through the corner at the crash site appeared to be critical with little margin for error. He also noted that tests undertaken on behalf of Boral could have been undertaken before the accident and used as a basis for signposting the corner or in providing specific speed instructions. He attributed the accident to the combined effects of the reverse camber and the absence of advisory speed signs. 
        
       
     27 Boral relied upon Professor Hahn of the University of New South Wales School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. Professor Hahn concluded that the major cause of the accident was excessive speed which he put at 30 kilometres per hour according to the computer records. He considered the loading of the vehicle but, apparently, he also was unaware of the evidence about the wet and sticky nature of the coal on the evening of the accident. He agreed that the following factors might increase the propensity of the vehicle to overturn. The first was uneven loading, which he said might cause a minor increase in risk. Secondly, he noted that cutting the corner would decrease the propensity to tip. He concluded that at a speed of 30 kilometres an hour the turning radius of the corner was such that overturning could occur even if the load were perfectly level. 
      
       
     28 Significantly, as Judge Sidis thought, Professor Hahn stated that the appropriate speed to be used in such a situation was one which could only be gained by experience. He suggested that a maximum speed of 20 kilometres per hour was safe in the particular case of the corner upon which the accident occurred. He said that the B-double combination involved in the accident had a higher centre of mass than that of a conventional side tipping B-double. That meant that more care was needed in their operation. Finally he concluded that the accident was caused by excessive speed noting that the factors which increased the propensity for tipping, that is road camber, load distribution et cetera, should have been taken into account by the driver when negotiating the bend. He referred to a report prepared by Mr Feenan for Boral who calculated the roll over speed for the bend on which the accident occurred as around 29 kilometres per hour and said that the rollover would have occurred irrespective of any loading of the vehicle. This was somewhat surprising to her Honour as in presenting its case Boral relied upon unevenness of the load in combination with the speed of the vehicle. 
      
       
     29 None of the expert witnesses gave oral evidence or were required for cross-examination. Accordingly, it was left to the trial Judge from the other evidence before her and from the written reports given by the experts to determine what expert evidence she accepted. 
      
       
     30 Judge Sidis preferred the evidence of Mr Waters to that of Mr Newton and Mr Day. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Newton at least was prepared to concede that he may have received some complaints of loading and may have forgotten about them. Mr Day was particularly defensive and I find unlikely his claim that he had never received a complaint of uneven loading at any time when he was operating the coal loader. In addition, Mr Goodbun was not called to challenge the evidence of Mr Waters and the plaintiff. In those circumstances I accept that complaints were made that evening concerning the uneven loading of the vehicle [sic].” 
         
        
       
     31 Judge Sidis noted Mr Day’s evidence that he was aware that uneven loading caused the truck drivers difficulties and he said that on occasions he warned drivers when he noticed their load was uneven. She accepted Muswellbrook’s arguments that in ordinary circumstances there were means available to the truck drivers to even out their loads and that travel over the route would effect some settlement of a load by the time the 25 kilometres had been travelled to the site of the accident. However, her Honour found that on that particular night the load was wet and sticky and that it was less likely to settle. Her Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s lack of awareness of the unevenness of his load, the evidence of a noise immediately preceding the overturning of his vehicle is an indication that the probability is that the load moved. This, coupled with the speed at which the plaintiff was taking the corner, I find to be the cause of the vehicle’s overturning onto its left-hand side. 
          
          
         There is evidence of the plaintiff that he did nothing different on this occasion to that which he had done on the first two or three times he travelled over the route. That evidence is the basis for my finding that the unevenness of the load was the critical factor in the plaintiff’s accident. This was something which was foreseeable on the part of the first defendant and I therefore make a finding of liability against the first defendant.” 
          
         
        
       
     32 Her Honour found Boral liable for its failure to provide a safe system of work for Mr Whitehead in a number of areas. Her Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Firstly, there was an absence of briefing on the road conditions and on the particular characteristics of the type of trailer which the plaintiff was driving on that occasion, with specific reference to its higher centre of gravity and its decreased stability. Secondly, the second defendant was aware of the plaintiff’s deficiencies as a driver and of the need to retrain him. The evidence is that the retraining proposition had been before the second defendant for some months prior to the date of this accident without implementation. Thirdly, and most significantly, there is the absence of any speed advisory sign at the site of the plaintiff’s accident. Mr Findlay, Mr Schnerring, Mr Feenan and Professor Hahn all note the critical speed tolerances so that an increase in speed of one to two kilometres made the difference between the safe negotiation of this bend and the accident which the plaintiff experienced. 
          
          
         It was argued that it was not reasonable to expect the second defendant to check all of the aspects of the road and to familiarise itself and its drivers with any dangers on the route. It is clear from Ex K  
         [the letter of termination] 
          that the second defendant expected the plaintiff to be aware of these problems but the plaintiff could only become aware of them through regular use of the route with the particular trailer which he was operating on that occasion. I do not think it was unreasonable in terms of the heavy onus on an employer to provide a safe system of work to oblige to the employer to take steps to identify and either brief its employees or place warning signs to alert them to situations where extra care needed to be taken. On these bases I also find the second defendant liable to the plaintiff. 
          
          
         I have apportioned liability between the first and second defendants as to 30 per cent to the first defendant and 70 per cent to the second defendant.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     33 As I have said the trial Judge reduced the verdict by 10 per cent for contributory negligence. 
      
       
        
       Grounds of Appeal 
       
     34 Boral’s amended grounds of appeal were: 
      
       
        
         
         1 Her Honour was wrong in finding the plaintiff was unaware, because he could not sight it, whether his load was even or uneven 
          
         .  
          
         1A Her Honour was wrong in finding that the Appellant was in breach of the duty of care that it owed to the First Respondent. 
          
          
         2 Alternatively, her Honour was wrong in failing to find that the plaintiff ought to have known that his load was uneven. 
          
         
         
         3 Her Honour was wrong: 
          
          
           
           (a) in concluding, if she did so conclude, that an absence of briefing on the road conditions was causative of the plaintiff’s harm; 
            
            
           (b) failing to consider properly, or at all, the causation issue. 
            
           
          
         4 Her Honour was wrong: 
          
          
           
           (a) in concluding, if she did so conclude, that an absence of briefing on the particular characteristics of the type of trailer, with specific reference to its higher centre of gravity and its decreased stability, was causative of the plaintiff’s harm; 
            
            
           (b) failing to properly consider, or at all, the causation issue. 
            
           
          
         5 Her Honour was wrong in concluding that the second defendant was aware of the plaintiff’s deficiencies as a driver. 
          
          
         6 Her Honour was wrong in concluding that the second defendant was aware of a need to retrain the plaintiff. 
          
          
         7 Her Honour was wrong: 
          
          
           
           (a) in concluding, if she did so conclude, that an awareness in the second defendant of the plaintiff’s deficiencies as a driver and/or of the need to retrain him was causative of the plaintiff’s harm; 
            
            
           (b) failing to consider properly, or at all, the causation issue. 
            
           
          
         8 Her Honour was wrong in concluding that the second defendant was empowered, or owed a duty to the plaintiff, to erect advisory speed signs at the site of the plaintiff’s accident. 
          
          
         9 Her Honour was wrong: 
          
          
           
           (a) in concluding, if she did so conclude, that the absence of any speed advisory sign at the site of the plaintiff’s accident was causative of the plaintiff’s harm; 
            
            
           (b) [in] failing to consider properly, or at all, the causation issue. 
            
           
          
         11 Her Honour was wrong in apportioning liability between the first and second defendants in the proportions of 30% and 70% respectively. 
          
          
         12 Her Honour must have applied the wrong test for determining the question of apportionment between the defendants. 
          
          
         13 Her Honour fell into error by failing to give any, or any sufficient, reasons for apportioning responsibility between the first and second defendants in the proportions of 30% and 70% respectively. 
          
          
         14 Her Honour was wrong in finding on the issue of contributory negligence that a proper allocation of responsibility to the plaintiff for the harm suffered by him was 10%. 
          
          
         15 Her Honour must have applied the wrong test in allocating to the plaintiff 10% of the responsibility for the harm suffered by him. 
          
          
         16 Her Honour fell into error in failing to give any, or any sufficient, reasons for apportioning the plaintiff 10% of the responsibility for the harm suffered by him. 
          
          
         17 Her Honour’s finding of 45% of a most extreme case for non-economic loss was a gross over-estimate of that aspect of any damage suffered by the plaintiff. 
          
          
         18 Her Honour’s finding that the earning capacity of the plaintiff, absent the accident, was properly valued at $1,050 per week was a gross over-estimate of the plaintiff’s hypothetical future earning capacity. 
          
          
         19 Her Honour’s finding that the plaintiff’s retained earning capacity should be valued at $560 per week was a gross under-estimate of the plaintiff’s retained earning capacity into the future. 
          
          
         20 Her Honour’s finding of the plaintiff’s past economic loss proceeded from an application of the wrong principles. 
          
          
         21 Her Honour’s finding of the plaintiff’s past economic loss is not supported by the evidence. 
          
          
         22 Her Honour’s finding of the plaintiff’s superannuation losses was a gross over-estimate of any loss that the plaintiff might suffer. 
          
         
        
       
       
       Ground 10 was not pressed. Grounds 1, 2, 5 and 6 which attack the trial Judge’s findings of fact are not grounds open on appeal unless supported by something more than the assertion that the findings were wrong or should have been made as the case may be. Nothing more was put. These grounds fail at the threshold.  
        
       
     35 Muswellbrook filed a notice of cross-appeal but limited its cross-appeal to the substantive finding by the trial Judge that Muswellbrook breached its duty of care owed to Mr Whitehead on the basis that it had unevenly and improperly loaded Mr Whitehead’s truck. Mr Harrison SC, who appeared for Muswellbrook, said there was no question raised about causation if the evidence established an eccentric load. 
      
       
     36 By leave and without objection Mr Whitehead filed a notice of cross-appeal on the following grounds: 
      
       
        
         
         1 Her Honour made a mathematical error in the calculation of the judgment sum of $514,603.27. 
          
          
         2 On the basis that her Honour’s finding of 10 per cent contributory negligence was correct, her Honour ought to have entered judgment against Muswellbrook Coal Company Limited in the sum of $587,511.28 and against Boral Transport Limited in the sum of $556,264.99. 
          
          
         3 Alternatively, on the same basis in respect to contributory negligence, her Honour ought to have entered judgment against Muswellbrook Coal Company Limited in the sum of $198,125.79 and against Boral Transport Limited in the sum of $389,385.49. 
          
          
         4 Her Honour erred in finding the Second Cross Appellant [Whitehead] guilty of contributory negligence. 
          
         
        
       
       
       Mr Whitehead also filed a notice of contention contending: 
        
         
          
         That, in addition to the grounds on which her Honour found the Appellant liable, her Honour ought to have found the Appellant liable in respect of the negligence of the Second Cross-Respondent because the Appellant owed a non-delegable duty of care to the First Respondent in respect of the system of work in which the First Respondent was engaging as an employee of the Appellant, in circumstances where the Appellant was on notice of defects in the system of loading employed by the Second Cross Respondent. 
          
         
        
       
     37 Boral’s grounds of appeal fall into four groups: 
      
       
        
         
         Breach of duty (ground 1A); 
          
         Causation (grounds 3, 4, 7 and 9); 
          
         Apportionment (grounds 11-16); and 
          
         Damages (grounds 17 – 22). 
          
         
        
       
       
       It is convenient to deal first with Muswellbrook’s appeal. Mr Maconachie QC, who appeared for Boral, adopted it though the challenge to Judge Sidis’ findings about loading was not one of Boral’s grounds of appeal. 
        
        
       Muswellbrook’s Appeal 
       
     38 The trial Judge’s conclusions seem on their face to be based on findings of fact not easily challenged on appeal. Muswellbrook’s argument was that there was no evidence that the trailers were loaded unevenly. Nobody came forward who had seen the load, there was no difficulty in driving the vehicle, ordinarily an indicator that the load was even, and no there was evidence that the automatic tarpaulin was inhibited in its operation, ordinarily an indicator of an uneven load. The point was a no evidence point. It was submitted that it was pure speculation to conclude that the evidence of a noise immediately before the overturning of the vehicle was an indication of the probability that the load had moved. There was nothing about the behaviour of the vehicle which demonstrated, even arguably, that the load was moving when the noise was made. The evidence that Mr Whitehead had done nothing different on this occasion from that which he had done on the two or three previous occasions he travelled the route was no basis for finding that the unevenness of the load was the critical factor in the accident. Mr Whitehead was not able to say what the state of his load was. Mr Waters agreed that if the load was very much to one side you would feel it in the cabin and in the steering as well. 
      
       
     39 Mr J E Sexton SC, who appeared for Mr Whitehead, emphasised Mr Whitehead’s evidence that he had negotiated the right-hand turn at the same speed and on the same line in the first two or three trips on the night in question. There was no evidence to the contrary from the computer generated reports. Her Honour was entitled to infer that Mr Whitehead’s evidence on this aspect was accurate. The monitoring system had monitored all the trips. These were documents available to Boral and to Muswellbrook. Such evidence, if it could have established that Mr Whitehead had not travelled at the same speed on the previous occasions, would have been compelling. 
      
       
     40 It was open to Judge Sidis to draw the inference that the trailers were incorrectly loaded from the following facts: 
      
       
        
         
         (1) Other vehicles had been incorrectly loaded earlier on the night of the accident. 
          
         (2) The coal being loaded was wet. 
          
         (3) Mr Whitehead had travelled over the designated route, including the section on which the accident occurred, earlier in the shift without incident. 
          
         (4) Mr Whitehead’s speed and line when the accident occurred were the same as he had adopted earlier without incident. 
          
         (5) Immediately before the accident Mr Whitehead heard a noise from the load. 
          
         
        
       
       
       None of these findings of fact was challenged. 
        
       
     41 In my opinion, on these findings of fact it was open to the trial Judge to conclude that the unevenness of the load was a cause of Mr Whitehead’s accident. Muswellbrook’s appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Boral’s Appeal 
        
       Breach of the Duty of Care 
       
     42 Boral relied upon O’Connor v Commissioner for Government Transport (1954) 100 CLR 225; Smith v The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (1957) 97 CLR 337 and Electric Power Transmission Pty Limited v Cuiuli (1961) 104 CLR 177 and the proposition encapsulated in the first of those cases in the joint judgment of Dixon CJ and Webb, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ at 229-230: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant as employer was of course under a duty, by his servants and agents, to take reasonable care for the safety of the deceased by providing proper and adequate means of carrying out his work without unnecessary risk, by warning him of unusual or unexpected risks, and by instructing him in the performance of his work where instructions might reasonably be thought to be required to secure him from danger of injury. 
          
          
         But the party was provided with trestles and plank and nothing was wanting in tools or equipment. The deceased was experienced in his work. It was obvious that a question must exist whether the awning would bear his weight. The party sent down was an ‘expert’ or competent to judge of that simple subject as anybody that could reasonably be sent. Doubtless Blyton, who told the deceased to go, thought that he would work on the roof, but it was left to the deceased and the rest of the party to do the job as they thought fit. Blyton was only the leading plumber and when he sent the deceased as the next man he was not directing him how he must perform the work. It simply meant that it was what he himself would do, and without further thought he spoke accordingly. In such a simple matter who else should be left to judge? Does the reasonable care demanded of the employer require him to cause a scientific or other elaborate examination to be made of the strength of the structure lest the working plumber may decide to trust himself to it rather than work from a plank or trestles? If, as the jury may be taken to have found, the dry rot was the cause of the awning failing under the deceased’s weight, the presence of the dry rot was as easily ascertained by the deceased as by anybody however skilled. The standard of care of an employee’s safety is not a low one, but in a case such as this the question must be whether any suggested course that was omitted could really be regarded as reasonable.” 
          
         
        
       
     43 So too the employer was not liable for the injuries of Mr Smith, the man who was told by a foreman to throw a heavy wooden packing case from a roof and who sustained severe injuries when his glove was caught by the case so that he was dragged from the roof to the ground below nor the employer of Mr Cuiuli, the caretaker who suffered an eye injury from a piece of wood which flew up as he struck it with a tomahawk.  
      
       
     44 No doubt the principle is well established that the relation of employer and skilled workmen should not be treated as equivalent to that of nurse and imbecile child (Smith v Austin Lifts Ltd [1959] 1 WLR 100 at 105) and that an area is marked out within which the employer’s duty to provide a safe system of work is inoperative though the immunity is limited to isolated operations of no complexity outside the normal system or to simple uncomplicated operations within it; see Glass, McHugh and Douglas, The Liability of Employers, 2nd ed at 45. But in my opinion the sentiments expressed in applying this principle to the facts of those cases come from an era where the standards of workplace safety required of an employer were quite different.  
      
       
     45 In Bankstown Foundry Pty Limited v Braistina (1986) 160 CLR 301 at 307 Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ in a joint judgment quoted a passage from the judgment of McHugh JA in the Court of Appeal in which his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think that it is impossible to read recent decisions of the High Court of Australia without realising that employers are now required to comply with safety standards which, only twenty years ago, would have been seen as imposing an onerous even an absurd burden on employers. [citations omitted]. 
          
          
         Throughout the common law of negligence, but particularly in the employer/employee field, the standard of care required of a defendant has moved close to the border of strict liability.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     46 The joint judgment continued shortly after this quotation: 
      
       
        
         
         “The reference by McHugh JA to strict liability is unfortunate because of its tendency to mislead but there can be no doubt that his Honour was not intending to break new ground in the law of employer’s liability. Indeed, he says explicitly that the common law requires no more than that an employer take reasonable care for the safety of his employee. Again, the reference by Priestley JA to what his Honour perceives in recent decisions of this Court as ‘a deliberate emphasis on the heavy obligation upon an employer in fulfilling his duty to take reasonable care’ must be evaluated in the context of the particular circumstances and issues which were involved in each of the cases to which he referred. This is not the place for an examination of the reasoning in earlier decisions of this Court. What must be asserted is that the law has not changed. It is as accurate today as it was thirty years ago to say that the duty 
          
           
            
           ‘is that of a reasonably prudent employer and it is a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the employees to unnecessary risks of injury’:  
           Hamilton v Nu Roof (WA) Pty Ltd 
            (1956) 96 CLR 18 at 25, per Dixon CJ and Kitto J. 
            
           
          
         We digress to remark upon the formulation preferred by Windeyer J, with whom McTiernan, Kitto, Taylor and Owen JJ agreed, in  
         Vozza v Tooth & Co Ltd 
          (1964) 112 CLR 316 at 319, namely: 
          
          
           
           ‘For a plaintiff to succeed it must appear, by direct evidence or by reasonable inference from the evidence, that the defendant unreasonably failed to take measures or adopt means, reasonably open to him in all the circumstances, which would have protected the plaintiff from the dangers of his task without unduly impeding its accomplishment.’ ” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     47 At 308-309 their Honours said: 
      
       
        
         
         “On the other hand, being a question of fact, it is undoubtedly true, as McHugh JA said, that what reasonable care requires will vary with the advent of new methods and machines and with changing ideas of justice and increasing concern with safety in the community. This must be so, because in every case the tribunal of fact, be it a judge sitting alone or a jury, must determine whether or not in the circumstances of the particular case the employer failed to take those precautions which an employer acting reasonably would be expected to take. What is considered to be reasonable in the circumstances of the case must be influenced by current community standards. In so far as legislative requirements touching industrial safety have become more demanding upon employers, this must have its impact on community expectations of the reasonably prudent employer. As Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ said in  
         McLean v Tedman 
          (1985) 155 CLR at 313, ‘Accident prevention is unquestionably one of the modern responsibilities of an employer.’ However, it would be wrong to exaggerate the recency of the trend in this regard. It has long been required of an employer that in the case of repetitive work under strain he take account of the possibility of thoughtlessness or inadvertence or carelessness on the part of an employee: see  
         Smith v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd 
           
         (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 342-343;  
         Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage & Trading Pty Ltd 
          (1970) 124 CLR 192 at 218.” 
          
         
        
       
     48 Liftronic Pty Limited v Unver (2001) 75 ALJR 867 was an appeal to the High Court from a decision of this Court. The trial jury reduced the damages by 60 per cent for contributory negligence. This Court substituted a reduction of only 20 per cent. The High Court upheld the appeal and restored the jury’s verdict. At issue was the responsibility of the employer for injuries suffered by an employee in a workplace accident. At para 25 (p871) McHugh J said that the trial Judge and counsel seem to have proceeded on the erroneous assumption that, if there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to the plaintiff that could have been avoided by using mechanical means, the defendant was necessarily negligent. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “But the issue in negligence is always whether reasonable care required the elimination of the risk having regard to the consequences of the risk, the probability of its occurrence and the cost, expense and inconvenience of eliminating it.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     49 Commenting on the decision of the Court in Braistina, McHugh JA said at para 37 (p874): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Court also criticised the majority judges in the Court of Appeal saying that a trial judge should not approach the issue of negligence on the basis of some perceived principle that there was a heavy obligation on the part of the employer to protect the worker. Nor should the judge approach that issue on the basis that the standard of care for an employer ‘had moved close to the border of strict liability’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       In para 38 his Honour said that  
       Braistina 
        emphasised that the employer’s duty is to take reasonable care for the safety of its employees and that what is reasonable is a question of fact to be judged according to the standards of the time. 
        
       
     50 In Smith, Dixon CJ said at 339 that he did not desire to qualify in any way the statement made by Kitto J and himself in Hamilton v Nu Roof (WA) Pty Ltd (1956) 96 CLR 18 at 25 and 26, a case where the defendant company was carrying out work using molten bitumen on the roof of a motor generator room on the sixth floor of a city building. The bitumen was heated on the roof of the fifth floor and placed in open buckets which when two-thirds full weighed forty pounds. Each bucket was raised by means of a rope to the level of the sixth floor roof and then carried manually up a fixed iron ladder where it was passed by hand to a workman on the roof of the generator. Mr Hamilton, a labourer employed by the defendant, was stationed on the shed roof lifting the buckets of molten bitumen to the workman on the motor generator roof who lifted the bucket onto the roof where he stood. One of the defendant’s objections to the suggestion that the bucket could have been hauled up by the use of a rope was that this might have splashed the wall. Mr Hamilton performed this operation on two occasions without incident, but on the third occasion as he stood on the shed roof with one such bucket in his hands and raised in front of him the bitumen spilt over the side of his face, his hands and forearms inflicting severe injuries. At 25-26 Dixon CJ and Kitto J said: 
      
       
        
         
         This is a simple case concerning an unmechanised operation. But care and foresight could not easily ignore the danger of the hot liquid doing the plaintiff very serious injury if it escaped while he manually lifted it upwards in front of his body and care and foresight could not overlook the hazard of the liquid spilling as a result of any of the chances to which the operation involving the raising of the heavy bucket was exposed. It is the sort of thing you would think might well arouse some degree of apprehension in any spectator of the operation, to say nothing of an experienced employer. 
          
          
         It has been said that a reasonable and prudent employer is (i) bound to take into consideration the degree of injury likely to result; (ii) bound to take into consideration the degree of risk of an accident; (iii) entitled to take into consideration the degree of risk, if any, involved in taking precautionary measures: per Parker LJ as cited by Lord Cohen,  
         Morris v West Hartlepool Steam Navigation Co Ltd 
           
         [1956] AC at 579. On the facts of the present case it may fairly be said that (i) the degree of injury likely to result would be grave; (ii) the degree of risk of an accident was real and not fanciful or inconsiderable; (iii) there was no degree of risk to any person in taking precautionary measures and the degree of risk of defacing the wall was not great and could be met completely by the exercise of ordinary care.” 
          
         
        
       
     51 I would adopt and apply to this case the comments (i), (ii) and (iii) in the joint judgment. Mr Whitehead was required to drive a vehicle which when fully laden became unstable as the result of uneven loading, over which he had no effective control, or if the speed exceeded by the slightest margin 30 kilometres an hour or thereabouts. He was required to drive the vehicle so loaded around a bend where the road was cambered in a way which would increase that instability. The exact rollover speed was uncertain but on one view 30 kilometres an hour at a turn of the sort Mr Whitehead here encountered. According to one expert the maximum safe speed was 20 kilometres an hour.  
      
       
     52 The attempt to compare Mr Whitehead’s position employed as a licensed driver of such heavy vehicles with the experienced plumber provided with “proper and adequate means of carrying out his work without unnecessary risk” (100 CLR at 229) is I think cynical. The risk here, as Boral should have foreseen and as events proved, was considerable and easily avoided by warning the driver that on a turn such as the one where the accident occurred he should not exceed a much lesser speed than 30 kilometres per hour. Clearly Boral was in breach of its duty of care in not as a matter of training advising Mr Whitehead of the upper limit of a safe speed in such circumstances and in not warning him of the risks of uneven loading and exceeding that safe speed. 
      
       
     53 Boral took the nice point that the road was a public road (it did not pause to prove this) and that there were criminal sanctions imposed by s4D of the Motor Traffic Act 1909 against persons erecting traffic control signs. This part of the argument, based on an assumption that there was a duty to provide a warning sign at this corner for trucks of the sort Mr Whitehead was driving to save the drivers from injury, was to the effect that Boral was only stopped from doing so by fear of criminal prosecution. No evidence was proffered that if Boral had asked the Roads and Traffic Authority for permission to erect such signs for safety reasons the Authority would not have allowed them and would have prosecuted Boral for doing so.  
      
       
     54 In my opinion, Mr Whitehead established that Boral was negligent in the manner particularised in the statement of claim, namely in failing to provide a safe system of work, in failing properly to instruct Mr Whitehead to check that the load in his vehicle was level and stable at all material times, in failing to heed warnings by its employees that the loader operating at Muswellbrook’s premises was incorrectly loading trucks thereby causing a risk of injury to the operators of the trucks, and in failing properly to instruct Mr Whitehead in the use of B-double haulage vehicles, in particular during haulage operations from the premises of Muswellbrook and in particular in failing to instruct Mr Whitehead to drive at speeds not exceeding certain limits during his right-hand turn onto the ICI Haul Road. 
      
       
        
       Causation 
       
     55 Boral submitted that there was no evidence that any of the found acts of negligence either singularly or combined were causative of the injury. Boral’s complaint was that her Honour failed to make specific findings about causation and give reasons for those findings. This is a step sometimes overlooked where the causative link is thought to be obvious as for example where the plaintiff is injured by a motor vehicle driven by the defendant. Judge Sidis defined as the first issue to be determined what caused the truck to overturn and stated three options, the negligence of the plaintiff, the negligence of the first defendant and the negligence of the second defendant. The trial Judge reviewed the expert evidence. She was satisfied that the truck was unevenly loaded and that the load moved. She said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This, coupled with the speed at which the plaintiff was taking the corner, I find to be the cause of the vehicle’s overturning onto its left-hand side.” 
          
         
        
       
     56 The evidence to which she referred pointed to the correctness of this conclusion. But the question not expressly answered was whether the breach of duty particularised caused the injury. In other words, the question is whether if the appropriate warning or instruction or signage had been provided the accident would have been avoided. In Betts v Whittingslowe (1945) 71 CLR 637, a case where an infant male employee had been injured at work by a machine he was operating and there was no evidence as to how the accident had happened, Dixon J, after referring to a decision of the English Court of Appeal said at 649: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not necessary to inquire whether their Lordships meant more than that the breach of duty coupled with an accident of the kind that might thereby be caused is enough to justify an inference, in the absence of any sufficient reason to the contrary, that in fact the accident did occur owing to the act or omission amounting to the breach of statutory duty. In the circumstances of this case that proposition is enough. For, in my opinion, the facts warrant no other inference inconsistent with liability on the part of the defendant.” 
          
          
         
        
       
     57 Had Mr Whitehead been properly instructed and advised of the dangers of driving the vehicle almost fully but unevenly loaded at a speed of 30 to 31 kilometres per hour on this particular corner, could there be any doubt that he would have heeded the warning by checking that the load was even and reducing his speed and if he had been instructed as to the appropriate speed limit, bearing in mind the danger and possible consequences of injury, that he would not have kept within the limit? While Judge Sidis did not expressly address these questions, I am satisfied there could be only one answer and that unfavourable to Boral. This head of appeal also fails. 
      
       
        
       Apportionment 
       
     58 I have no difficulty in accepting that Boral’s breaches of duty involved greater culpability, that is to say degree of departure from the standard of care, and greater relative importance in causing Mr Whitehead’s injury; compare Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Limited (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 494. I say this not only because Boral’s duty was that of an employer to its employee but particularly because Boral had been advised that its vehicles were being unevenly loaded and took no steps to remedy this. No ground has been demonstrated to increase the proportion of the verdict to be born by Muswellbrook and Muswellbrook did not appeal against the proportion awarded against it. Nor do I think any ground has been shown for interfering to increase the amount of the deduction for contributory negligence. Using his experience on an area of road new to him with this particular truck Mr Whitehead approached the corner on a line and at a speed which had to that point appeared to be safe. He received no warning or instruction nor did he have any previous experience to suggest that it was not. He did not exceed any speed limit of which he knew and he did not know that the truck was unevenly loaded. Mr Whitehead appealed against this reduction only on the contingency that Boral’s appeal against the inadequacy of the deduction for contributory negligence would lead us to conclude that there was some error disclosed in the reasons for judgment requiring a reassessment of the apportionment. No such error has been demonstrated and accordingly we need not consider this ground of cross-appeal further. In my opinion, the appeal by Boral under this head also fails. 
      
       
        
       Damages 
       
     59 Boral relied entirely upon its written submissions. The trial Judge referred to Mr Whitehead’s evidence that after the vehicle rolled he was suspended on the driver’s side before he took his seatbelt off and dropped onto the passenger side. He felt extreme pain in his neck and his side. A fellow driver came to his assistance and he was taken by air ambulance to the John Hunter Hospital where he stayed for ten days. He was released on crutches and was then treated by his general practitioner, Dr Brookman. He underwent a significant amount of physiotherapy and was treated otherwise with pain-killing medication and sleeping tablets. He contracted an infection which was appropriately treated.  
      
       
     60 Mr Whitehead underwent a significant period of rehabilitation, following the advice of his rehabilitation providers and their instructions. He said his condition improved until it plateaued at about the beginning of 1999 and had remained the same since that date. He said he suffered from significant back pain when seated but that the pain eased gradually when he stood and moved around. He has pain when he is in bed and sleeps only for four to five hours. He said he could not sit for twelve hours in a single trailer or a B-double, but he had had no opportunity to attempt a shift of truck driving. He was able to drive a motor car with back support to ease his pain. He was receiving no specific treatment at the time of trial but still took sleeping tablets and pain-killing medication. He had a problem with his left shoulder in the nature of pain and restricted range of movements. The pain was a dull pain the whole of the time. He could lift his arm only half way because there appeared to be a knot in his shoulder and that caused pain. At the time of his rehabilitation he was undergoing some stress as to his future and there was a recommendation that he receive psychological counselling. There was no doubt however that he was highly motivated to work and was keen to re-train. In assessing damages on a common law basis the Judge awarded $105,000 and applying the Act assessed him at 45 per cent of a most extreme case.  
      
       
     61 Mr Sexton said with some justification that the trial Judge made detailed findings as to the injuries and disabilities suffered by Mr Whitehead in the accident and their ongoing effect on him. Those were not challenged in the appeal. What Boral sought to do was to select some parts of some reports and urge that these be preferred to other medical evidence that was the subject of the trial Judge’s detailed review. Nothing was advanced to explain why these selected parts of the evidence should have been preferred to produce a lesser award for non-economic loss. Mr Whitehead was 33 at the time of the accident and 35 at the date of the trial. He suffered stress fractures to his back, and injury to his shoulder and continued to suffer back pain and limitations to physical activities due to the condition of his back and shoulder. All of the doctors, except Dr Smith whose opinion the trial Judge did not accept, opined that Mr Whitehead had a permanent impairment to his back, was unfit for his former occupation of driving heavy trucks and was limited in his capacity to lift.  
      
       
     62 None of the evidence referred to in Boral’s written submissions read in the context of the evidence as a whole supports the conclusion advanced that in the circumstances the compensation for non-economic aspects for general damages was so inordinately high as to be an erroneous estimate of damage. In my opinion, the award was well within the range. 
      
       
     63 Mr Whitehead was certified to return on light duties in October 1998. On the day of his return, 7 October 1998, he was, as already noted, terminated. He said that he received no assistance from his rehabilitation providers in securing employment but found for himself employment as a casual waiter in a Hunter Valley vineyard for a short period in the summer of 1998/1999. In April 1999 he acquired a lawnmower sales and repair business which he was still operating at the time of the trial in partnership with his wife. He employed two mechanics and had recently engaged a salesman. His own duties involved ordering stock, stocking the shelves, undertaking telephone calls, sales and undertaking some minor repairs if a machine was lifted onto a bench for him by some other person. The business operated seven days a week, twelve hours a day. Mr Whitehead worked between five and six days a week. The preponderance of medical opinion was that he would not return to truck driving. Judge Sidis commended Mr Whitehead for his rehabilitation to income earning activities.  
      
       
     64 To calculate damages for Mr Whitehead’s loss of income earning capacity he claimed the difference between his average weekly earnings when employed by Boral of $1,050 and the income earning capacity according to the award rates for a salesman working fifty hours per week which was $560. Both of these figures were net figures. Mr Whitehead’s evidence was that up to the date of the trial he had drawn little from the business. The trading profit and loss statement for the business for the year ended 30 June 2000 showed a net profit of $23,588.54 compared with a loss of $11,298.44 in the previous year of income after the business had been in operation for only two months. A distribution of $11,794.27 was made to Mr Whitehead and to his wife. Judge Sidis said that even if she were to allow that a greater proportion of the gross profit of the business should be attributed to Mr Whitehead’s efforts the resulting figure would still not approach the $560 per week net used for comparison purposes. Her Honour determined that she should allow the future loss of income capacity as claimed by Mr Whitehead and superannuation losses as claimed by him both to the age of sixty-five. 
      
       
     65 Boral submitted that Mr Whitehead would have been unlikely to maintain a career in truck driving, particularly for Boral, and referred to the warnings he had received. On this basis it was said that it was not legitimate to use his earnings as a truck driver as the basis for calculating economic loss and that a contingency deduction higher than 15 per cent, which apparently was the contingency factor taken, though this is not clear from the reasons for judgment, was called for. Boral submitted that Judge Sidis erroneously ignored the fact that the sales of the business from 1 July 1999 to January 2000 amounted to $275,000. It was then said that Mr Whitehead’s failure to provide proper figures to prove the true position achieved by the business invalidated her Honour’s approach.  
      
       
     66 This attack is without any justification whatever. No cross-examination was directed to Mr Whitehead to suggest that he had failed to provide proper figures nor was his accountant who had provided the material required to attend to be cross-examined about these figures. It was obvious from the accounts that only modest drawings were available to Mr Whitehead from the business. The trial Judge acknowledged that this might improve in the future but accepted the sensible proposal that Mr Whitehead’s earning capacity be measured by reference to the award rates for a salesman working fifty hours per week. The assertions in the written submissions that the amount awarded for superannuation was based on an incorrect approach to the assessment of future economic loss and did not take into account the full extent of the profits derived from the plaintiff’s business were not explained and should be rejected. In my opinion, no ground whatever has been shown to interfere with those heads of damage the assessment of which Boral challenged. 
      
       
        
       Cross-Appeal 
       
     67 Mr Whitehead submitted that Judge Sidis made a mathematical error in the calculation of the judgment sum of $514,603.27 after allowing a reduction of 10 per cent for contributory negligence. The trial Judge ought to have entered judgment against Muswellbrook in the sum of $587,511.28 and against Boral in the sum of $556,264.99. This correctly left to Mr Whitehead the option to choose whether to recover the whole judgment from Muswellbrook or to recover the maximum recoverable from Boral and the balance from Muswellbrook, with the practical effect of the contribution claims depending upon how Mr Whitehead satisfied his judgment. The calculations to arrive at these figures were complex and set out in Mr Whitehead’s submissions on the cross-appeal. They were required in order properly to apply s151Z of the Act. They explained the error in the calculation at trial and have not been challenged by either Boral or Muswellbrook. They show that Muswellbrook is only entitled to a contribution of $389,385.49 being 70 per cent of $556,264.99 from Boral and that Muswellbrook is liable to contribute $198,125.79, being the difference between $587,511.28 and $389,385.49, to Boral. As I have said, none of these calculations were challenged and in my opinion the verdict and judgment should be set aside and the figures so calculated substituted. Mr Whitehead is entitled to have judgment entered in his favour against each of the defendants for the full amount for which that defendant is liable; Oxley County Council v MacDonald & Ors (unreported) [1999] NSWCA 126 at para 51. Each of the defendants has its right of contribution against the other. 
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
     68 Boral’s appeal should be dismissed with costs to be assessed on an indemnity basis. Muswellbrook’s cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mr Whitehead’s cross-appeal should be allowed and the amounts of the verdicts adjusted to accord with it. However, these miscalculations must, it seems to me, be attributed to the parties and I do not think there should be any order for the costs of the cross-appeal.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONIRELAND AJFriday, 2 November, 200110657/01 - Shane SIMPSON v Bryan WILSON & AnorJUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: By Amended Summons filed 20 August 2001 the plaintiff, Shane Simpson, by way of appeal pursuant to s 104 of the Justices Act, 1902, seeks the following relief:-2 1. An order pursuant to s 109(a) of the Justices Act, 1902 (NSW) quashing the order of the first defendant made on 8 February 2001 at Coonamble Local Court, namely that the plaintiff is not entitled to raise a plea in bar in the nature of autrefois acquit with respect to the charge that the plaintiff, on 9 March, 2000, at Coonamble in the state of New South Wales did assault Nicholas Harris.3 2. An order pursuant to s 109(a) of the Justices Act, 1902 (NSW) quashing the order of the first defendant made on 8 February, 2001 at Coonamble Local Court, namely that the charge that the plaintiff, on 9 March 2000 at Coonamble in the state of New South Wales did assault Nicholas Harris did not constitute an abuse of process.4 3. An order pursuant to s 109(a) of the Justices Act, 1902 (NSW) quashing the order of the first defendant made on 8 February 2001 at Coonamble Local Court, namely that two charges that the plaintiff, on 9 March 2000, at Coonamble in the state of New South Wales did contravene the restrictions of an apprehended violence order, did not constitute an abuse of process.5 4. An order in the nature of prohibition pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, 1970 (NSW) restraining the defendants from proceeding on or in respect of the above charge (sic).6 5. An order that the proceedings in respect of the above charges be permanently stayed.7 6. Costs.8 7. Such other order as this Honourable Court sees fit.9 At the commencement of the proceedings, Ms Francis of counsel informed the Court that the relief specified in Order 1 above, i.e. an order founded upon autrefois acquit was not pressed.10 On behalf of the first defendant Mr Bryan Wilson, a Local Court Magistrate, a submitting appearance except as to costs, has been filed.11 By Notice dated 17 August 2001 filed in Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 9 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, 1986 has taken over as second defendant the appeal regarding the proceedings against the plaintiff for alleged contravention of restriction in apprehended violence orders pertaining to the victims Margaret Harris and Nicholas Harris. A notice pursuant to s 10 having previously been filed with regard to the assault charge.12 The facts giving rise to the charges, which are the subject of this appeal, may be summarised as follows:-13 On the evening of 9 March 2000 at physical confrontation occurred in the toilet of the Club House Hotel at Coonamble involving the plaintiff, Mr William Harris, and his son, Mr Nicholas Harris.14 On 5 April 2000 the plaintiff appeared at Coonamble Local Court with respect to two informations which alleged assault occasioning actual bodily harm in contravention of s 59 of the Crimes Act, 1900. The alleged victims were Nicholas Harris and his father, William Harris. The prosecution brief was served on the plaintiff. On the plaintiff’s application the matters were adjourned to 3 May 2000 for mention.15 On 3 May 2000 the plaintiff entered pleas of not guilty to both s 59 informations. The matters were adjourned to 6 June 2000 for a defended hearing.16 On 6 June 2000 the defended hearing with respect to the two s 59 informations commenced before the first defendant. 17 On 7 June 2000 the first defendant dismissed both informations. On that same day the prosecution laid two further informations against the plaintiff for common assault in contravention of s 61 of the Crimes Act, 1900. The alleged victims were Nicholas Harris and his father, William Harris. The information in relation to William Harris was later withdrawn. On the application of the plaintiff, the assault charge relating to Nicholas Harris was adjourned to 4 July 2000 for mention.18 On 15 June 2000 two informations were laid against the plaintiff each alleging contravention of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO). The “protected person” named in the ADVO was Margaret Anne Harris, the mother of Nicholas Harris. The first alleged contravention being the alleged assault of Nicholas Harris by the plaintiff. The prosecution alleges that perforce of his conduct, the plaintiff intimidated Nicholas Harris being a person having a domestic relationship with the protected person Margaret Anne Harris. The second contravention relates to alleged threats made by the plaintiff directly to Margaret Anne Harris.19 On 4 July 2000 the two ADVO informations before Coonamble Local Court were adjourned to 8 August, 2000 on the plaintiff’s application to allow the defence to put forward submissions in relation to the principle of autrefois acquit. The assault charge was also adjourned to that date.20 On 8 August 2000 defence submissions were made on behalf of the plaintiff with regard to a plea of autrefois acquit, double jeopardy and res judicata. A permanent stay was also sought with regard to the two ADVO informations. All matters were adjourned to 4 October 2000 for prosecution submissions in reply.21 On 4 October 2000 the prosecution submissions in reply were made and the matters were adjourned to 22 November for decision of the Court.22 On 22 November 2000 the Court was unable to sit due to floods. All matters were adjourned to 6 December 2000.23 On 6 December 2000 the plaintiff’s solicitor was unable to attend Court and the matters were adjourned on the plaintiff’s application to 2 February 2001.24 On 2 February 2001 the first defendant delivered his decision rejecting the defence submissions and ordered that all matters proceed to a hearing on the merits at the earliest possible time.25 It would appear from the transcript of proceedings in the Local Court, Coonamble, that the orders against which the plaintiff seeks relief were made by the first defendant on 2 February 2001 and that the date of 8 February 2001 appearing in orders 1, 2, and 3 of the Amended Summons is incorrect.26 To the extent that the remedy sought by the plaintiff of a permanent stay as a result of abuse of process may be considered to be an interlocutory order requiring leave of this Court pursuant to s 104(4) of the Justices Act, it is common ground that the issues raised are questions of law and no objection is taken by the defendants to the granting of leave under that section.27 The plaintiff contends that by virtue of the way in which the hearing of the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the plaintiff was heard on 6 and 7 June 2000 the subsequent charge against him of common assault and the two summons matters of breach of Apprehended Domestic Violence Orders (ADVO) constitute an abuse of process.28 Central to the plaintiff’s contention is an exchange between the Bench and the Prosecutor following evidence by the two complainants having been given on 6 June 2000 (page 29 line 40) where the following appears:- “BENCH: I note at this stage there is (sic) going to be two further prosecution witnesses. Subject to where they take it, and any submissions made at that stage I note there’s no backup charge sergeant. The prosecution are only relying on the two matters before the court. 
     
      
       
        PROSECUTOR: Not at this stage your Worship.” 
        
         
       
      
    29 This exchange, it is submitted, put the Prosecutor on the clearest notice that there was a distinct possibility that the first defendant would find against him. As I understand the submission, there was an election by the Prosecution to proceed with only the matters before the Court and hence the hearing was conducted on the basis that the Prosecution was not “inviting” the presiding Magistrate to consider a “backup” count of assault in respect of Nicholas Harris.30 As a consequence, so the submissions runs, the solicitor appearing on behalf of the plaintiff did not call evidence and made a successful May v O’Sullivan (1995) 92 CLR 654 submission.31 The further submission is made that the presiding Magistrate, in whom was vested the power to orally charge the plaintiff with assault, see Evans v DPP [2000 NSW SC 1005 6.11.2000] and see also Ex Parte Williams: Re Singleton (1928) 28 SR (NSW 616), subject to considerations of procedural fairness, during the course of the proceedings should have done so.32 The failure of the presiding Magistrate to follow this course, as I understand the submission, offended against the principle of finality of litigation between parties; relied upon are Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 at 115; 67 ER 313 at 319; Port Melbourne v Anshun (1981) 147 CLR 598.33 The plaintiff further contends that the failure on the part of the presiding Magistrate to follow the course of orally charging the plaintiff with assault at the hearing, constituted an abuse of process. In this regard reliance is placed upon Jago v The District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23. Cited in support is the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J (as he then was) commencing at p 47:- “An abuse of process occurs when the process of the Court is put in motion for a purpose, which in the eye of the law, it is not intended to serve. The purpose of criminal proceedings, generally speaking, is to hear and determine finally whether the accused has engaged in conduct which amounts to an offence and on that account, is deserving of punishment. When criminal process is used only for that purpose and is capable of serving that purpose, there is no abuse of process. Although it is not possible to state exhaustively all the categories of abuse of process, it will generally be found in the use of criminal process inconsistently with some aspect of its true purpose, whether relating to the hearing and determination, its finality, the reason for examining the accused’s conduct or the exoneration of the accused from liability to punishment for the conduct alleged against him.” 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    34 The plaintiff relies upon Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions (1964) AC 1254 and the analysis of that authority by Viscount Dilhorne in DPP v Humphrys (1977) AC 1 at 23 where his Lordship said this:- “… in Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions the House was not concerned with the power of a Court to quash any indictment it thought oppressive or vexatious. It was concerned with the propriety of a second trial on evidence on which the accused had already been tried for another offence.” 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    35 In support of the principle that no man should be punished twice for offences arising out of the same or substantially the same set of facts Ms Francis, on behalf of the plaintiff, makes further reference to the speech of Lord Devlin in Connelly at 1347 where the following passage appears; “I consider it to be within this power for the Court to declare that the prosecutor must as a general rule join in the same indictment charges that “… are founded on the same facts, or form or are a part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character”. 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    36 In this regard I note that the quotation to which his Lordship was making reference is an extract from the rules set out in a schedule to the Indictments Act, 1915 (Eng.)37 Further reference is made to the speech of Lord Devlin in Connelly  at 1360 where the qualification is added:- “But a second trial on the same or similar facts is not always and necessarily oppressive and there may in a particular case be special circumstances which make it just and convenient in that case. The Judge must then, in all the circumstances of the particular case, exercise his discretion as to whether or not he applies the general rule.” 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    38 In the speech of Lord Reid at 1296, upon which reliance is placed, his Lordship said this:- “So the general rule must be that the prosecutor should combine in one indictment all the charges which he intends to prefer. But in a case where it would have been improper to combine the charges in that way, or where the accused has accepted without demur the prosecutor’s failure so to combine the charges, a second indictment is allowable.” 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    39 The plaintiff contends that the authorities mandate the finding of special circumstances in order to justify the procedure adopted in the present case; see Connelly (ante) and see also Regina v Beedie (1997) 2 Cr App R 167, and that this was not done.40 The plaintiff further contends that in declining to permanently stay further proceedings against the plaintiff as being an abuse of process, the first defendant failed to undertake the weighing process involving a subjective balancing of factors and considerations including fairness to the accused as well as the legitimate public interest in the conviction of those guilty of crime and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. Walton v Gardiner (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 at 395-396 citing Jago (ante).41 In oral submissions Ms Francis further submitted that the charge of assault upon Nicholas Harris offends the principle of double jeopardy. This argument was, however, not further developed. 42 The crux of the plaintiff’s case is put by Ms Francis as being what she describes as “the abandonment” by the prosecution of further proceedings against the plaintiff during the course of the Local Court hearing. 43 Mr Marien on behalf of the second defendant submits firstly that as a matter of practical reality had the alleged common assault by the plaintiff upon Nicholas Harris been the subject of a backup charge to the s 59 charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the latter charge would necessarily have been dealt with first. Had this order of proceedings not been followed an acquittal on the common assault charge would have attracted a plea in bar of autrefois acquit with respect to the s 59 charge. Further, had there been a finding of guilt on the s 59 charge there would have been no need to proceed on the common assault charge.44 On the issue of abuse of process in relation to the common assault charge the second defendant submits that the laying and prosecution of this charge is not an attempt to “…litigate anew a case which had already been disposed of by earlier proceedings,” in the sense those words are used in Walter v Gardiner (ante) at 393. The offence of common assault and an offence in contravention of s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 are clearly different, the latter requiring proof of actual bodily harm; and see also Connelly (ante) per Lord Morris at 1304 where his lordship said:- “There is no abuse of process if to a charge which is properly brought before the court and which is framed in  
     
      
       
         
        
        an indictment to which no objection can in any way be taken there is no plea such as that of autrefois 
         
       acquit or convict which can successfully be made.” 
        
         
       
      
     I accept the force of this argument.45 Insofar as there was delay in bringing the AVDO proceedings, the plaintiff does not assert that delay in the circumstances of this case constitutes an abuse of process. What is asserted by the plaintiff is that the plaintiff has been subjected to “repeated attempts to convict him, the embarrassment of further proceedings, further ordeal compelling him to live in a state of anxiety and as well, prosecutorial conduct enhancing the possibility of conviction.”46 I am unable to accept this submission. The charge of common assault could have been heard and determined on 7 June following delivery of the first defendant’s decision on the s 59 charges. The plaintiff elected to seek an adjournment rather than rely upon the evidence then before the court or to call evidence or to relitigate the charge. He was perfectly within his rights to do so but cannot now be heard to say he is being subjected to “repeated” attempts to convict him.47 As to the AVDO charges these have not been the subject of a hearing. It is not suggested the plaintiff will not receive a fair trial. There is, in my view, no improper purpose which can be ascribed to the bringing of the proposed proceedings.48 Accordingly for the foregoing reasons the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief sought in the Amended Summons.49 The Amended Summons is therefore dismissed. The plaintiff is to pay the costs of the second defendant. There will be no order as to the costs of the first defendant.  **********

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 IPP, AJA: Justice Greg James will propose the order to be made. 
      
       
     2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal. It is apparent on the Crown's submissions and on the submissions of the applicant that the sentences are attended with a number of technical defects as not according with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 2000 in a number of respects. 
      
       
     3 It is conceded by the Crown that the application for leave to appeal should be allowed and the appeal should also be upheld. 
      
       
     4 It is conceded that the sentence should be re-crafted to represent the trial judge's intention and to accord with a submission of the applicant that he should not have to serve, for these crimes which include the crime for which he was sentenced and those taken into account on the Form I, a longer period of custody than two years' imprisonment. 
      
       
     5 The re-crafted sentence proposed by the Crown, which seems to accord with the trial judge's intent would, in fact, produce a period of actual custody of 22 months.  
      
       
     6 The orders I would, therefore, propose, having heard the Crown on what is the appropriate sentence, is that the applicant, in lieu of the sentence passed by the trial judge, be sentenced to a period of imprisonment for two years, five months and 10 days, to date from 9 May 2000. That a non-parole period of 22 months be imposed in respect of that sentence to date from that date. That the applicant be ordered to be released on parole on 8 March 2002 and that in that order he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, the order being made in accordance with Form 3 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2000 upon the standard conditions. 
      
       
     7 In accordance with the Act, the applicant has been informed of his release date. 
      
       
     8 IPP, AJA: I agree with that proposal. 
      
       
     9 STUDDERT, J: So do I. 
      
       
     10 IPP, AJA: That will be the order of the court, as proposed by Greg James, J.

      REGINA v. MICHAEL KANAAN 
      
      
      SENTENCE 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 8 August 2001, verdicts of guilty were returned against the offender by a jury following a lengthy trial. 
    2 By those verdicts he was found guilty of having murdered Adam Wright and Michael Hurle and of having maliciously wounded Ronald Singleton with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. These offences occurred at Five Dock on 17 July 1998. 
    3 Both of the deceased expired on 18 July 1998, despite medical attempts to save their lives. 
    4 The offender stands convicted of those three offences. He was born on 23 May 1975 and is now 26 years of age. 
    5 The maximum sentence for each of the crimes of murder is, in the circumstances to which I will shortly refer, a sentence of life imprisonment which, if passed, must be served by the offender in custody for the whole of his life. The maximum sentence for the crime of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is 25 years. 
    6 Following the verdicts, the proceedings on sentence were adjourned on the application of both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel, to obtain evidence and to prepare written submissions. I have received extensive written submissions from the Crown and Victims' Impact Statements. Oral submissions and evidence of the offender's background have been provided on his behalf. I have taken time to consider the matter closely, since the Crown has submitted that for each of the murder offences the offender should be sentenced to that life sentence to which I have already referred. That sentence has terrible significance: see Regina v. Garforth (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 23 May 1994); Regina v. Petroff (Hunt, CJ. at CL., unreported 12 November 1991); Regina v. Baker (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported 20 September 1995); Regina v. Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327, particularly in the case, as here, of an offender of comparative youth: see Garforth (supra) and Regina v. Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469 at paragraphs 72, 124-134. But that latter decision is authority that the absence of the ability to impose a non-parole period in such circumstances and subjective considerations should not mitigate against the imposition of the life sentence where the heinousness of the crimes, their moral culpability and the lack of prospects of avoiding recidivism, require the sentence to be passed to protect the community: Harris (supra) at paragraphs 79-100; Garforth (supra) at p.5. 
    7 The offender has a criminal record but has only been convicted of the offence of common assault in 1997. For other earlier matters he had received the benefit of s.556A. That record would not preclude leniency in the event that there might otherwise be found a basis for extending it. 
    8 Victims' Impact Statements were provided to me from the mother and father of the deceased Michael Douglas Hurle and the family of the deceased Adam Wright. Those persons providing the statements fell within the definition of ""family victim"" contained in s.26 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 28(3) of that Act provides that the court must receive those statements, acknowledge their receipt and may make any comment on them the court considers appropriate. But, by s.28(4)(b), the court must not consider the statement in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence unless it considers that it is appropriate to do so. 
    9 It has been held in Regina v. Previtera (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76 and in other cases that such statements should not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the punishment to be inflicted on the offender lest there might be a perception that the taking of some lives is to be attended by a higher punishment so that it might be indicated that some lives are of more or less value than others. 
    10 Nonetheless, it remains appropriate for me to comment as I do that the statements make clear the extent of the tragedy that has occurred to those who made them in being deprived of their loved one who, in each case is shown as a person for whom a high degree of affection was cherished. The court entirely recognises the grief and sorrow of the families of the deceased. 
    11 There has also been tendered to me a Victim Impact Statement by Ronald Singleton. Ronald Singleton is a primary victim of the offence of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. It would be entirely appropriate that one has regard when sentencing to the effect on the victim of a malicious wounding. However, that statement refers to the devastating effects on Mr. Singleton of his view that his actions had in some way contributed to what had occurred to his two deceased friends. He refers to himself as feeling guilty. I see no basis in the evidence which would afford any logical or rational support for that feeling. What he did at the time may have been ill-advised. But there was no possible basis on which he might have had any prospect of considering his actions could lead to consequences such as those inflicted upon his friends by Mr. Kanaan. 
    12 I have had regard to his statement only to the extent of making the comment that I have upon it as far as the offences of murder are concerned. Otherwise, it does not assist me in relation to the sentence for murder or the sentence for malicious wounding and I have not taken it into account in determining any of the sentences. 
    13 The offender had originally been charged with the attempted murder of Ronald Singleton. At an earlier trial, which eventually aborted, after an application made to me, I directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on that charge. I did so as I accepted the submission it was not open to the jury to accept that the only rational hypothesis on the evidence involved the necessary element of an intent to kill since the evidence of where the wounding was effected and the immediate surrounding circumstances indicated at the time of the wounding only an intent to cause really serious bodily harm to Mr. Singleton in order to enable the offender and others to escape from the scene of the shootings. The alternative charge as was preferred at the present trial, however, went ahead on the basis of that latter intent. 
    14 I need not, here, set out in any more detail the matters which caused me to take the course I did, as I published a short statement of my reasons at the time. However, having regard to the evidence, the verdict on that count in this trial is only explicable upon the basis that the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to cause really serious bodily harm to Mr. Singleton by shooting him in the shoulder at close range with intent to disable him by wounding him. 
    15 Each of the shootings of Mr. Wright and Mr. Hurle involved a shot being fired at close range to the central part of their bodies. I find each killing was inflicted with intent to kill deliberately formed and in each case carried out with appalling ruthlessness. 
    16 At trial, it was established by the evidence given by an associate of the offender that when the offender and others in a car were passing by a hotel at Five Dock, the witness noticed two persons having an altercation outside the hotel. He made a remark to those persons which caused one of them, the victim Mr. Singleton, to come over to the car which was in the vicinity of the footpath on which the altercation was taking place, and attempt to punch the witness. Thereafter, the offender left the car and shot Mr. Wright and Mr. Hurle. He also shot Mr. Singleton in the shoulder seriously wounding him. 
    17 Other eyewitness accounts from people who had been at the hotel or who were passing by, were understandably somewhat chaotic about these events and their order. But it is clear that these events occurred within a very short space of time. I treat them as one closely related series of offences escalating the culpability of the individual offences. 
    18 There was evidence from the associate, which I accept, that following the shooting of Mr. Singleton, the offender pointed the gun at Mr. Singleton and attempted to fire it again a number of times, but the weapon did not discharge. The accused said, ""I ran out of bullets"". When it was indicated that there was another firearm in the car he said, ""why didn't you tell me"". According to the associate, as the offender and the other occupants of the car were fleeing from the scene of the shooting, the offender said words to the effect, ""As long as we are all right, fuck everyone else. Fuck the Aussies, as long as we're all right. If it happened again I would do the same thing, as long as we're all right"". 
    19 Counsel for the offender submitted I should treat these statements as mere gangster's braggadocio and not as serious statements. I regard those statements both as braggadocio and as seriously meant. This is a matter of importance for sentence since the statements accord with the offender's actions being done in a display to his associates of his willingness and readiness to act publicly with savage and lethal force. The statements confirm that the offender was concerned that what he did was for the benefit of himself and his gang of associates. The relevance of this matter will be further apparent when later in these remarks I turn to Exhibit F tendered by the Crown on the issue of the prospects of rehabilitation. 
    20 The party went to Telopea Street, Bankstown where, with the assistance of a group of other persons, an attempt was made to conceal the perpetrator from justice by damaging the car to make it appear that it had been stolen and by disposing of the pistol in question. The offender and the associate concealed themselves in a South Coast holiday house for some time after the events. 
    21 There was evidence at the trial establishing that the offender had been in possession of that pistol on earlier occasions and had it on the night in question because of his involvement in activities connected with drugs. His counsel placed reliance on that last matter as a circumstance of mitigation. 
    22 I do not take into account those matters as aggravating the offender's guilt, but I reject the entirely cynical submission made on his behalf that because he was, on the fatal night, carrying the gun in connection with his illegal activities concerned with drugs, his punishment for using the gun as he did should be mitigated. It was put that he should be seen as less culpable than someone who had premeditated the killings and who obtained the gun for the purpose. There is no point in such a comparison. It disregards the fact that the offender was carrying the gun to inflict violence whenever he wished and that he had immediate resort to its use when expedient, although the occasion in no way warranted such a response. The very spontaneity of his resort to its use shows culpability of a high order.  
    23 At trial, the offender put his guilt in issue by his plea. He gave no evidence either at trial or on sentence before me. But, the defence case denied the presence of the offender in the car; denied that he was a shooter and raised the suggestion that some other occupant of the car, including the associate who gave evidence in the Crown case, was responsible. Evidence was called from various witnesses that the accused was in fact at home playing cards with his brother and friends; not present when the party in the car stopped on route to the hotel at a café and was not present in the car at any time. 
    24 His brother, and others, gave evidence of the alibi to which I have referred. It is plain that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there was no truth whatsoever in that account. The evidence of that alibi was indeed incredible. The jury were entitled to regard that evidence, the evidence of another witness asserting the offender was not in the car and the evidence he was not at the café, as deliberately untrue. 
    25 The direct evidence linking the accused with the crime and showing his attempts to avoid justice afterwards came from the associate. 
    26 A substantial attack was mounted in defence of the charge on the reliability and character of the associate. The case was left to the jury as one in which, for there to be a verdict or any verdict of guilty, the jury had to be satisfied of the evidence of the associate beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had performed the three shootings as that witness had related. The jury were so satisfied. I accept the account that witness gave also. 
    27 That account establishes that the offender perpetrated an entirely vicious and cold-blooded series of crimes with overwhelming ruthlessness. That ruthlessness accompanied a spontaneous disproportionate response to a situation initially of very limited significance. Rather than consideration being given to detaching those involved from what was a minor altercation by some comparatively innocuous act, the offender chose to use the lethal force he had at his command in the pistol which he carried, to kill those who were in the vicinity and to remove Mr. Singleton's impediment to the car leaving by seriously wounding him. There was no suggestion that either of the deceased had given any provocation or presented any danger or impediment to the accused leaving the scene. The actions that were described by the witness enable me to conclude that what the offender did at that time was a considered, ruthless and vicious series of killings coupled with the wounding to which I have referred. The actions were callous in the extreme. They call for an emphasis on the sentencing elements of personal and general deterrence and community protection. 
    28 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that following the wounding of Mr. Singleton, the offender would have continued to shoot had he been able. I do not conclude that he would have killed Mr. Singleton or attempted to kill him since the offender was not charged with those offences. But I consider these actions, what he said after the offences and his efforts to avoid detection as giving context to the offences proved against him and as relevant to his dangerousness and the prospects of his rehabilitation or recidivism and as important in deciding what is necessary for the protection of the community. 
    29 The offences were callous and calculated. They showed a high degree of heinousness and an absence of mitigating features, particularly when one considers the offender's words and actions both immediately and shortly after the event. The offences of murder and that of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm were plainly within the ""worst class of case"" contemplated by the legislature as punishable by the maximum sentence. 
    30 Further, he has not only shown no contrition, but before me on sentence volunteered that he disclaimed any. 
    31 The Crown submits that:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The offender displayed an appalling indifference to human life and suffering and a cold-blooded callousness. His indication that he would act the same way again in similar circumstances raises concerns about whether he poses a continuing danger to the community."" 
        
       
      
    32 I agree. The Crown further submits:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""If it is established that the prisoner is a risk to the community that may be taken into account in determining what weight may be given to subjective factors which might otherwise call for leniency:  
        Regina v. Veen (No. 2) 
         (1987-88) 164 CLR 465;  
        Regina v. Garforth 
         (NSWCCA, unreported 23 May 1994 at p.5). The Crown says that in this case there are no subjective features that call for leniency. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        It is submitted that having regard to the prisoner's attitude to the offences that the sentence imposed should have a significant component relating to specific deterrence. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Having regard to his assertion that he would act the same way again in similar circumstances, the issue of community protection also needs to be addressed."" 
        
       
      
    33 The subjective features to which this submission refers were related in a report of Terry Kesby-Smith, a psychologist, dated 5 September 2001, tendered without objection. In that report, Mr. Kesby-Smith sets out the information he had been given by the offender as to his own circumstances. 
    34 Mr. Kesby-Smith concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The family and developmental history of Mr. Kanaan was described as functional, positive and nurturing. He indicated sharing a close, secure and loving relationship with both parents. He grew to young adulthood with a stable, appropriate and adaptive personality. His outlook on life was positive and he was clear in saying that he had the utmost regard for the rights and property of others. He indicated that he had not had any difficulties with any form of conduct disorder throughout his developmental years. He denied suffering any symptoms consistent with depressed or anxious effect. Like most in his social network, he consumed marihuana but unlike many of his peers he avoided alcohol. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Mr. Kanaan appears to be a young man of well above average intelligence with an equivalent understanding about and insight into his social and personal responsibilities. He has very well developed interpersonal skills. There were not any signs that he suffered from any form of emotional disturbance. His sense of self was very positive and he impressed as being a confident and assured man. He had good insight into his current circumstances, the legal system as it affects him and the implications this process places onto him."" 
        
       
      
    35 Those observations were based entirely upon what Mr. Kanaan had said to the psychologist about himself. 
    36 To the psychologist, Mr. Kanaan had emphasised he and his family's active practice of their deep Christian faith and their loyalty to their religion. The offender had rejected any involvement with alcohol and asserted that violence had no influence in the family history. He had attended various church schools and claimed to be an attentive and ambitious student who enjoyed his achievement. He had attended a Christian Brothers college and attained a higher school certificate, matriculating with a TER of over 80. He had attended a degree course at university intending to enter the Federal Police until convicted of the assault charge to which I have already referred. Following that charge, he went into the computer business. 
    37 He has described himself to the psychologist as a model prisoner (notwithstanding the activities shown in Exhibit F, to which I will later refer) claiming that he has never been adversely affected by anxiety, depression, anger, impulse control difficulties, conduct problems or fear. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""I respect myself and I hope this gains respect from others. I treat people the way I want to be treated and they have get (sic) to know me to get an answer to what that is. I am very loyal to my family. I know who I am. I know what I have done and for what I am responsible. I am deeply religious and a strong believer. I pray every day. If I am not that kind of person then I would not be described as a model prisoner. I have a very strong faith; what God wants will happen. I don't know why all this has happened, I know I must trust in God and be patient."" 
        
       
      
    38 All of this was in the context of the offender's denial of the commission of these offences. No reference is made to his involvement in illegal activities connected with drugs, with illegal firearms, with the activities of attempting to conceal the commission of the crime and no reference is made to his association with others involved in illegal activities including while in gaol (Exhibit F). 
    39 Mr. Kesby-Smith says:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The self-reported conduct of Mr. Kanaan, whilst a remandee over the past 26 months, has been positive. He impressed me as co-operative with the interview processes."" 
        
       
      
    40 It is on the basis of those matters that Mr. Kesby-Smith expressed the following prognosis:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prognosis of Mr. Kanaan is likely to see him to conform to the necessary institutional processes and upon his release to return to his family. It is expected that they will provide him with the necessary emotional, personal and financial support. He is likely to continue his education in some aspects and upon his release to gain appropriate and challenging employment. There does not appear to be any emotional, family or relationship difficulties, which would require counselling intervention. His reported history is generally of appropriate and with purposive behaviour and it is most likely that he will maintain this style of living upon discharge."" 
        
       
      
    41 Mr. Kesby-Smith was not called to give evidence and was not cross-examined. Mr. Kesby-Smith appears to have been accepting of the offender's assertions. Those assertions, in the context of what has been found proved against the offender, indicate that the account given to Mr. Kesby-Smith was so lacking as to be entirely deceptive. I am unable to accept that account as providing circumstances which should attract leniency. In particular, that account displays no evidence of contrition, nor any such matter as would make me consider there was positive hope for rehabilitation. In Regina v. Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, the Chief Justice and Smart, AJ. reflected on how little weight, if any, might be given to self-serving, untestable statements given to psychologists in the absence of testable evidence and to conclusions based on such statements. 
    42 However, the offender's prior circumstances as reported by him illustrate that his upbringing afforded to him a great deal of advantage which should have operated to avoid his involvement in criminality, particularly criminality so serious as this. There is no explanation or reason for his brutal behaviour which might mitigate the sentence. 
    43 His assertions that he respects the lives and property of others are directly in the teeth of his proved guilt. The omission of this fact is consistent with his denial of his guilt, but the omission of what was put forward by his own counsel of his involvement with firearms and drugs is not so easily explained and is such as to undermine his assertions and the prognosis that for the future one could expect appropriate purposive behaviour. Indeed, the contrast between the behaviour referred to in the report and that proved in evidence at the trial is such that I have been forced to conclude that this document shows a manipulation of the psychologist to present a false picture. I conclude this is consistent with the way in which this offender acted following the offence. Thus there is no suggestion in this material that he is likely to avoid recidivism in the future, particularly when involved with his associates. My views are reinforced by the evidence in Exhibit F of the offender's illegal contacts while in gaol with other prisoners detained for serious crimes. 
    44 In Regina v. Barac [1999] NSWSC 61, in the context of a submission by the Crown that the life sentence should be imposed, I considered the psychological and personality defects of the prisoner as might go to show dangerousness. In that case I was not satisfied of the circumstances of heinousness or aggravation such as is discussed in Garforth (supra) and Regina v. Twala (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994). I did, however, conclude that the prisoner was dangerous. That conclusion, had I concluded that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was as extreme as s.61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires, would have meant that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only have been met by the imposition of the life sentence. In that case, I concluded that, with appropriate treatment, there was a prospect that the prisoner's behaviour might be modified and that he was prepared, whilst in custody, to work towards rehabilitation. 
    45 The present offender does not apparently have those psychological or personality defects. His actions and his subsequent conduct show he too is dangerous. There appears to be nothing which warrants treatment. There is every indication that the offender is not prepared, whilst in custody, to work towards rehabilitation from the commission of these offences (see Exhibit F). This arises not from lacking insight, but from his denial of any criminality. There seems little prospect while things remain thus, of rehabilitation or of avoiding recidivism. I see no prospect of change. 
    46 I had concluded in the case of Barac (supra) that having regard to how long might be necessary for the processes of rehabilitation and personal deterrence to occur, a minimum term of 20 years should be imposed. In the present case there were submissions from both counsel as to the length of sentence in the event that the life sentence was not to be imposed as to a minimum term in the order of 20 to 30 years. The offender's counsel accepted that that was an appropriate range, but submitted that a minimum term of 20 years was sufficient. 
    47 In argument I pointed out that there comes a point when the length of the minimum term of a sentence is so high that the discrimination between that and the life sentence can become of limited practical value to an offender. These observations apply less in the case of an accused who is much younger. Questions could arise as to parity of sentence with those who, whilst older, commit crimes of similar culpability. In this case it is not necessary for me to resolve any such problem as I have concluded that these killings, the culpability for which is not to be diminished by the fact that there are two of them, are, in my view, in the worst class of case. They are, in my view, at a level of culpability about which s.61(1) speaks. I have come to that conclusion when evaluating the circumstances of each crime and I further conclude that the offender exhibits such a degree of dangerousness that, had I been in any doubt, that fact would have led me to conclude that the level of culpability required the life sentence, since the community interests referred to in s.61(1) could only have been met through the imposition of that sentence. 
    48 In Regina v. Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131, I reviewed sentences for offences of murder committed in circumstances of extreme callousness or depravity and discussed the principles applicable to the imposition of the life sentence. In that case I had specific regard to objective culpability much less than was reflected in the acts of this offender, albeit, I there had to have regard to a long history of proved dangerousness arising from the extensive criminal record of the prisoner. I was of the view in Petrinovic (supra) that in the event that I concluded that the circumstances of an individual offender were such as were apposite to the application to them of the requirements of s.61(1), the life sentence was mandatory. 
    49 That view has not been shared by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Harris (supra). The view was expressed that, even where the other criteria are satisfied, the life sentence remains discretionary. Other than in that respect, I do not understand that case to express any disagreement with what I consider to be the proper application of principle as I expressed it in Petrinovic (supra). However, I understand the decision in Harris (supra) as indicating that, where the requirements of s.61(1) are met, in the proper exercise of discretion the life sentence may be passed, particularly if the circumstances of the offence and its heinousness demand it and those of the offender do not mitigate against it. I consider I should exercise that discretion in this case. 
    50 As to the circumstances of the offence, the submission that this crime is insufficiently heinous (see Garforth (supra), Twala (supra) and Harris (supra)), in that other crimes of multiple killing, of contract killing or killing after extended torture are of extreme heinousness, fails to deal with the ruthlessness and callous attitude to human life displayed by the offender. 
    51 As to the circumstances of the offender, the only one which speaks in his favour on analysis, is his youth. But that as with prospects of rehabilitation is not critical (Garforth (supra)). Section 61(1) does not provide a less or more stringent criterion dependent on age. 
    52 The youth of the offender is, of course, entirely relevant to whether the community should for the rest of the offender's life be protected from him. The legislature has chosen to provide for a life sentence in the absence of any possible consideration for parole in the circumstances where the culpability of the offender's behaviour as judged now appears to require the community to be protected from him for the rest of his days. I share the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Harris (supra) that it is much to be regretted there cannot be an opportunity at some time in the future to evaluate the offender's prospects for release in circumstances where an appropriately informed authority can consider the protection of the community looking at what has happened during the years that would have to elapse before such consideration might be given. But looking at the prospects as evidenced now, I am firmly of the view that, having regard to the multiplicity of offences, the two killings, in the context of the wounding of Mr. Singleton, and also the total culpability of the offender for the three offences, the sentence of life imprisonment for each of the murders is the only appropriate sentence. 
    53 For each of the offences of murder, I sentence the offender to life imprisonment. For the offence of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I sentence the offender to imprisonment for 25 years. The sentences are to be concurrent. 
    54 I take into account that the offender has been in custody referrable to these matters since 17 September 1999. I specify 17 September 1999 as the day on which the sentences are to be taken to have commenced.  
    55 For the reasons I have given for imposing the life sentences and because of the nature of the malicious wounding offence, I decline to set a non-parole period.

      REGINA v RICKY MARK DUNGAY 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: On 14 December 2000, after a trial by jury in the District Court sitting at Port Macquarie, the appellant was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 13 December 2000 and to expire on 12 June 2002. He appeals against both the conviction and the sentence. 
      
       
     2 The complainant alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by a number of men on New Year’s Day in 1999 at two locations near Crescent Head, New South Wales. The assaults took place after the complainant had accepted a lift in a car driven by one Bobbie Jarrett and in which five other men, including the appellant, were sitting. She knew all of the men concerned. In consequence of her allegations, the appellant and four of the men were arraigned in relation to various sexual offences that they were alleged to have committed. 
      
       
     3 The complainant described various sexual acts committed upon her by a number of the accused persons. She asserted that she had not consented to any of these acts. Significantly, she gave evidence exculpating the appellant. Indeed, she said that during her ordeal the appellant showed her “respect”. 
      
       
     4 The sole evidence inculpating the appellant in the offence charged was a lengthy electronically recorded interview conducted with him by the police. The appellant had been arrested at about 9.00 am on 1 January 2000, and the interview was conducted at about 11.00 am. The Crown alleged that, in the course of that interview, the appellant confessed to the offence charged. 
      
       
     5 Difficulty has arisen in regard to the audio tape of the interview that was before the jury. This has been lost. The transcript of the interview was admitted into evidence but “as an aide memoire only”. The trial judge explained that the purpose of the transcript was to help the jury follow what was on the tape. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is the evidence on the tape that is the evidence of these conversations and I think I might have said before if you detect any difference between the transcript and what you hear on the tape, well then what you hear on the tape is the evidence you act on.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour pointed out that this was an important issue because, in regard to answer 355, the parties could not agree what was said on the tape and what could actually be heard. His Honour told the jury that they had to make their own decision about what was said. 
        
       
     6 According to the transcript the question and answer to 355 were in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q.355 What’d you, what, just tell me what you did?  
          
         A. I just touched her in the car.  
          
         
        
       
       
       The parties eventually agreed, however, that the words “in the car” were wrong and the words “on the cunt” should be substituted together with the words “I fingered her”. The exchange continued: 
        
        
         
         “Q.356 Yes, what put fingers inside her? 
          
         A. I fingered her. 
          
         Q.357 …..went inside? 
          
         A. Mmm, one. 
          
         Q.358 O.K. How long time, how long for? 
          
         A. Oh, about, five seconds. 
          
         Q.359 Not very long? 
          
         A. About ten seconds.” 
          
         
        
       
     7 It was said on behalf of the appellant during the appeal that the words from questions 356 to 359 were also not clear and the parties were speaking over each other. This proposition had not been advanced at trial and the transcript in these respects had not been challenged. The issue so raised pointed up the significance of the missing audio tape. The appellant contended that as the audio tape was missing this Court could not be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. The respondent submitted to the contrary. In the light, however, of the conclusion to which I have come it is not necessary to examine this issue in any detail. 
      
       
     8 At the trial counsel for the appellant objected to the interview being admitted into evidence. A voir dire was held and the appellant’s objection was overruled. The trial judge said that at the forefront of the submissions advanced on the appellant’s behalf was the illegality of the arrest of the appellant. It seems that the principal point raised was a submission that the police failed to tell the appellant why he was being arrested. It is apparent, however, from the judge’s reasons, that counsel for the appellant also argued that the arrest was unlawful because the appellant had been arrested solely for the purposes of being questioned.  
      
       
     9 The trial judge found that the arresting police officer, Constable Senz, had reasonable cause to suspect and did suspect that the appellant was involved in the alleged assault on the complainant. This fact appeared to have led his Honour to conclude that if there was an illegality “it was only marginally so”.  
      
       
     10 I shall first deal with the argument that the arrest was unlawful because the appellant was not told of the reasons for his arrest.  
      
       
     11 In the reasons for his decision in regard to the voir dire, the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “A person is entitled to be told what he is being arrested for, but failure to do so does not, in every case, make the arrest unlawful”. 
          
         
        
       
       
       His Honour was presumably referring to  
       Christie v 
         
       Leachinsky  
       (1947) AC 573 where Viscount Simon at 587-88 recognised that circumstances may arise where it would be inappropriate for a person to be advised immediately of the true ground of the arrest. His Honour seems to have formed the view that because Senz was outnumbered it was reasonable for him not to have given the appellant reasons for his arrest.  
        
       
     12 When the appellant was arrested, he was in the company of two of the other persons who were accused of sexual assault. Senz said that he was concerned if he arrested the men all at once some or all would abscond. He called for back-up and made no arrest until another police officer arrived. It was in these circumstances that he omitted to inform the appellant of the reason for his arrest. He merely took the appellant, together with the other men to the police station, telling them that they were required to be spoken to there by one of the detectives.  
      
       
     13 It can be seen that, whatever the position might have been earlier, by the time the appellant was arrested there were two police officers present, namely, Senz and the newly arrived officer. At that stage there was no reason for the police to refrain from informing the appellant of the reason for his arrest.  
      
       
     14 The trial judge appears to have confused the period prior to the arrest when only one police officer, Senz, was present, with the moment of the arrest when the police considered it safe enough to arrest all three men. I consider therefore that his Honour erred in this respect. 
      
       
     15 Ms Woodburne, who appeared for the Crown, pointed out, however, that Sergeant Kenny, who in effect was the senior police officer involved, told the appellant at about 9.30 am on 1 January 2000 that he was suspected of having sexually assaulted the complainant. Sergeant Kenny said that he cautioned the appellant and told him that he was under arrest.  
      
       
     16 I will, for the purposes of these reasons, accept that the appellant, in these particular circumstances, was told within a reasonable time of his arrest why he was arrested.  
      
       
     17 I turn now to the issue whether the arrest was unlawful because the purpose of the arrest was merely investigative. 
      
       
     18 The lawfulness of an arrest is to be determined by the common law as stated in Christie v Leachinsky: Adams v Kennedy (2000) 49 NSWLR 78. An arrest solely for the purposes of questioning a person or to obtain evidence is unlawful: Williams v R (1986) 161 CLR 278; R v Foster (1993) 67 ALJR 550.  
      
       
     19 The arresting officer must take the person arrested “before an authorised justice to be dealt with according to law”: s 352(1) of the Crimes Act. The combined effect of s 352 and the common law is that a person arrested without a warrant is to be taken before a justice to be dealt with according to law as soon as is reasonably practicable: R v Ainsworth (1991) 57 A Crim R 174.  
      
       
     20 Despite the fact that, in the voir dire, the legality of the arrest was challenged, the Crown led no evidence to the effect that there was any intention on the part of the arresting police officer or any other police officer to take the appellant before a justice or any other judicial officer so that he could be charged with the offence of which he was suspected of having committed. 
      
       
     21 Sergeant Kenny was the officer in charge who instructed Constable Senz to arrest the appellant. Sergeant Kenny told Senz that the appellant and the other men who had been seen together in a car should be arrested “so that we could detain them for the purpose of investigation”. Under cross examination Sergeant Kenny agreed that he wanted the appellant arrested so that he could be taken to the Police Station and asked questions so as to assist the police in their further investigations. He made no mention of the appellant being arrested so that he could be taken before a magistrate. 
      
       
     22 Sergeant Kenny was also cross-examined as to whether, at any time while the appellant was in detention, he intended that the appellant be taken before a justice “or something like that”. Sergeant Kenny replied, “No, it wouldn’t have crossed my mind”.  
      
       
     23 In further answers to cross-examination Sergeant Kenny made it plain that he believed the police were entitled to arrest a suspected offender and detain him for up to four hours for the purposes of investigation without there being any intent on the part of the police to take the offender to a judicial officer to be dealt with according to law. This testimony supported the inference that, from the time of the appellant’s arrest until at least the interview, Sergeant Kenny never considered taking the appellant before a judicial officer.  
      
       
     24 The investigative purpose of the interview is also apparent from an examination thereof. Very few questions concerned the participation of the appellant in the events on the day in question. By far the majority of the questions were directed to ascertaining whether the appellant was able to cast any light on the involvement of others.  
      
       
     25 In my opinion, it is apparent from the evidence that the state of mind of the police was such that, from the time of the arrest to the completion of the interview, no relevant police officer had the intention of taking the appellant before a magistrate or justice at any time. This is a major point of distinction between this case and R v Kane (2001) NSW CCA 150 to which Ms Woodburne referred. In R v Kane the police officer concerned had such an intention from the moment of the arrest. 
      
       
     26 Accordingly, the police arrested the appellant solely for the purposes of investigating the complainant’s allegations and did not have any intention of taking him before a judicial officer.  
      
       
     27 During the course of the argument at the voir dire, counsel for the appellant submitted, as the judge remarked: 
      
       
        
         
         “That police are not permitted to arrest people for the sole purpose of questioning them”. 
          
         
        
       His Honour accepted that there was “abundant authority to support that proposition” but  
       appeared to consider that the point was answered by the finding that the police had reasonable cause to suspect that the appellant was involved in the alleged assault on the complainant. In this, the learned judge was plainly wrong.  
       
     28 The trial judge did not bear in mind that it is a requisite for a valid arrest that the arrest be for the purpose of taking the arrested person before a judicial officer to be dealt with according to law as soon as is reasonably practicable. As the arrest of the appellant was solely for investigative purposes, it was unlawful. 
      
       
     29 I appreciate that Pt 10A of the Crimes Act provides for the detention (for a limited period) of a person after arrest for the purposes of investigation. But such a lawful detention is dependent upon a lawful arrest having been effected (see s 356B(1)(a) and s 356C(1) and (2)).  
      
       
     30 I have pointed out that the trial judge said that if the arrest were illegal because the appellant was not informed of the grounds for his arrest then that illegality was only marginal. For that reason, his Honour said that illegality did not “require the evidence [of the interview] to be excluded”. 
      
       
     31 I have concluded that his Honour erred in his view as to the illegality of the arrest. In the circumstances, this Court is required to exercise its own discretion as to whether the evidence of the interview (that was obtained “in contravention of an Australian law” within the meaning of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act) should be admitted (cf R v Foster at 553).  
      
       
     32 The test under s 138(1) of the Evidence Act is whether “the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained”. Unless the Crown can show that it is desirable, in accordance with the test so laid down, that the evidence of the interview be so admitted, it should be excluded. 
      
       
     33 In determining whether the evidence should be admitted, factors of fairness and public policy are relevant (cf R v Foster, albeit that the High Court was there dealing with what evidence should be excluded rather than admitted). In the present case it is the issue of fairness that is predominant. 
      
       
     34 I shall first mention those factors, relied on by the Crown, which tend to support the admission of the evidence.  
      
       
     35 Accepting the transcript of the interview at face value, the probative value of the admission is fairly strong, although regard must be had to the appellant’s assertions throughout the interview that he “touched”, “rubbed” and “fingered” the complainant on the vagina (which assertions were inconsistent with penetration).  
      
       
     36 The offence itself is a most serious one and the evidence of the confession is crucial. Without it, as the Crown accepts, the prosecution must fail. This an important factor to be taken into account. 
      
       
     37 I also accept that the fact that the police had reasonable cause to suspect that the appellant had committed a crime of a sexual nature in regard to the complainant tends to support the desirability of admitting the evidence.  
      
       
     38 Another factor in favour of the Crown is, as Ms Woodburne pointed out, the fact that the manner and type of questions were entirely fair. They were not leading questions and the answers on which the Crown relies were volunteered by the appellant. 
      
       
     39 I now come to the factors which militate against the admission of the evidence. 
      
       
     40 The gravity of the illegality is an important factor under s138. Ms Woodburne submitted that the existence of Part 10A diminished the gravity of the unlawfulness of the arrest. She pointed out that, subject to a lawful arrest, the police were entitled to detain for the purposes of investigation. Accordingly, she submitted, if they arrested a person for that purpose alone (and the arrest for that reason was unlawful), the departure from the law should not be regarded as being particularly serious.  
      
       
     41 I disagree with this submission. Section 356C(1) of the Crimes Act makes it clear that Pt 10A does not confer any power upon the police to detain a person who has not been lawfully arrested. The common law has always jealously guarded citizens against arbitrary arrest: Williams v R. The duty to bring an arrested person before a judicial officer as soon as is reasonably possible is one of the foundations of a democratic society. Our law recognises that no person should be arrested merely for the purposes of investigating whether he or she has committed a crime. Part 10A does not detract from this fundamental principle. In my opinion, the illegality involved in the appellant’s arrest has to be regarded as being serious indeed. 
      
       
     42 In considering the question of fairness further, the testimony of the complainant has to be taken into account. Her evidence was to the effect that the appellant was not guilty of the offence charged. Firstly, the complainant, as I have mentioned, stated that the appellant had not participated in any of the sexual acts performed upon her. Secondly, she testified that some person unknown to her inserted two fingers in her vagina at a time when she was on the bonnet of the car and the driver, Jarrett, was performing a sexual act upon her. According to the complainant it could not have been the appellant who inserted his fingers in her vagina because he was too far away at the time. There was evidence on the part of the appellant himself that was consistent with him not being at the scene at the relevant moment.  
      
       
     43 A further important factor involves the conduct of Detective Gilmour. Prior to the interview Detective Gilmour said to the appellant: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am going to ask you some questions about an allegation that has been received that earlier today when you were with [the men in question] in a black Ford sedan you sexually assaulted [the complainant]. Do you understand that? 
          
         
        
       
       
       The appellant replied in the affirmative. Detective Gilmour then said: 
        
        
         
         “I am going to ask you some questions. You do not have to say or do anything if you do not want to. Do you understand that?” 
          
         
        
       The appellant again replied in the affirmative.  
        
       
     44 The statement by Detective Gilmour that he had received an allegation that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant was false. No such allegation had been made by the complainant. Detective Gilmour made the statement as a result of a misunderstanding on his part that I accept may have been reasonable. That, however, is not a satisfactory answer to the point. The fact is that, prior to the interview, the appellant was falsely told that the complainant had asserted that he had sexually assaulted her. This was unfair. 
      
       
     45 Ms Woodburne pointed out that, in his testimony during the voir dire, the appellant had not said that Detective Gilmour’s false statement had influenced him in making the admission. While this fact is not without weight, it is apparent from the interview that the appellant, who is an Aborigine, is not an educated person and it is not likely, in my opinion, that he would have appreciated the need to draw attention to Detective Gilmour’s false statement. True it is that the appellant’s counsel said nothing about the issue at the trial, but it seems that its significance was simply not appreciated by those then representing the appellant. Common sense tells one that such a statement could well have had a bearing on the appellant’s responses in the interview.  
      
       
     46 Ms Woodburne drew attention to evidence that, when Detective Gilmour administered the caution, the appellant was not listening to what was being said. That is not to say, however, that the appellant did not hear the false statement by Detective Gilmour. 
      
       
     47 According to the appellant, at the time of the interview he was scared. It is again common sense that, had he been told that the complainant had not made any allegation of sexual assault against him, his fear would have been alleviated to a significant degree. Had that occurred, the appellant may have answered the questions in the interview differently. 
      
       
     48 Ms Woodburne drew attention to the test for unfairness laid down in R v Lee (1950) 82 CLR 133. I accept that that is the test that should be applied. The High Court said there (at 154) that the requisite question is, “[W]hether, having regard to the conduct of the police and all the circumstances of the case, it would be unfair to use his own statement against the accused.” Their Honours stated that they knew of no better exposition of the whole matter than that which is to be found in the judgment of Street J in R v Jeffries (1946) 47 SR (NSW) 284 at 311-14. Street J said, relevantly: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is a question of degree in each case, and it is for the presiding Judge to determine, in the light of all the circumstances whether the statements or admissions of the accused have been extracted from him under conditions which render it unjust to allow his own words to be given in evidence against him.” 
         
        
       
     49 In applying that test it is also salutary to bear in mind what was said in R v Lee at 159 and repeated in R v Foster at 555, namely: 
      
       
        
         
         “The uneducated – perhaps semi-illiterate – man who has a record and is suspected of some offence may be practically helpless in the hands of an over-zealous police officer. The latter may be honest and sincere, but his position of superiority is so great and so over-powering that a ‘statement’ may be ‘taken’ which seems very damning but which is really very unreliable. The case against an accused person in such a case sometimes depends entirely on the ‘statement’ made to the police. In such a case it may well be that his statement, if admitted, would prejudice him very unfairly. Such persons stand often in grave need of that protection which only an extremely vigilant court can give them.” 
         
        
       
     50 In my opinion, the force of the nature of the illegality, the false statement by Detective Gilmour, the omission to tell the appellant of the complainant’s statement exculpating him, the nature of her evidence generally and the other statements made by the appellant in the interview, outweigh the factors relied on by Ms Woodburne who, in a cogent argument, said everything that could possibly have been said on behalf of the Crown. 
      
       
     51 In all the circumstances I consider that it would be unfair to the appellant to admit the evidence of the interview. 
      
       
     52 Once the evidence of the interview is excluded there is no evidence inculpating the appellant. Accordingly, the appeal should succeed, the verdict of the jury should be set aside and a verdict of acquittal should be entered. 
      
       
     53 STUDDERT J: I agree with the orders proposed and I agree with the reasons expressed by Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     54 GREG JAMES J: As do I. 
      
       
     55 IPP AJA: Those will be the orders of the Court.

       Judgment 
       
     1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Studdert J. 
     2 STUDDERT J: The appellant, Kosta Doncev, stood trial in August 2000 charged with an offence under s 233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act of having in his possession without reasonable excuse a quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as ecstasy) which had been imported into Australia in contravention of the Act. The charge alleged a trafficable quantity of the drug was involved. The jury found the appellant guilty and he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of six years with a non parole period of three years, and the sentence commenced on 31 August 2000. 
     3 The appellant appeals against his conviction; he does not seek leave to appeal against sentence should the appeal against conviction fail. 
     4 Before considering the various grounds of appeal, it is desirable to outline the evidence relied upon by the Crown. 
      
       
      Summary of the Crown case 
     5 On 23 November 1995 Federal police officers seized a parcel which had arrived in Australia addressed to “Victor Dimitrov, 35 Roadshow Drive, Wodonga, Australia.” The postmark on the package indicated it had been sent from The Netherlands some days previously. The package contained two photograph albums and close inspection disclosed that there were white tablets that had been hidden inside each of the front and the back covers of the albums. 1900 tablets were found. The nett weight of the tablets was 528.9 grams and analysis revealed that the pure ecstasy content was 159.8 grams.  
     6 The police removed all but 20.1 grams of the tablets, replacing the tablets removed with some inert substance and the package was then reassembled in preparation for a controlled delivery. 
     7 The package was delivered to Victor Dimitriyevich at his home in Wodonga. (This recipient stood trial with the appellant on a like charge to that faced by the appellant, but was acquitted by the jury.) Having received the package, Dimitriyevich put it in his car and set off to drive to Sydney. His movements, and subsequently those of a man named Dinic, and the movements of the appellant were observed by police officers who gave evidence at the trial. Upon arrival in Sydney, Dimitriyevich was observed with Dinic and another person at a restaurant in Bondi, but whilst Dimitriyevich was in the restaurant the package remained in the boot of the car. Dinic left the restaurant and went to Dimitriyevich’s vehicle. He drove that vehicle to a nearby street where the appellant was standing by a telephone booth. The appellant joined Dinic in the car. Dinic drove the car a short distance down the street, did a U-turn and then stopped.  
     8 Dinic left the car and removed the package from the boot. Then Dinic was seen standing at the front of the vehicle, urinating at a tree, whilst the appellant remained by himself in the front passenger seat, with the interior light of the vehicle on. Whilst he was so seated, the appellant was observed with a brown cardboard box on his lap, holding a book in his hands. There was a second book seen resting on the centre console of the vehicle beside the appellant. The appellant was observed to throw one of the books into the rear of the vehicle before police approached and arrested both the appellant and Dinic, who had re-entered the car just before the police arrived at it. The books seen proved to be the photograph albums. Both photograph albums were retrieved from inside the car and it was observed that the front and back covers of each had been torn open and the white tablets had been removed. The box earlier observed and one of the damaged photograph albums were located on the back seat of the vehicle. The second photograph album was found between the two front seats in the console area, as was the tablets described earlier. The appellant was searched and he was found to have over $7000 in his possession. 
     9 An interview was conducted by the police with the appellant. In that interview the appellant denied seeing or looking at the photograph albums and denied any knowledge of the white tablets. He said he did not know Dinic’s surname, but he had met with him prior to arrest with the aim of going to see a person with whom Dinic had left some brochures of paintings which had been painted by a person named Suzie, who was described by the appellant as being his nephew’s girlfriend. 
      
       
      The evidence of the appellant 
       
     10 The appellant subsequently gave evidence at the trial. Just as he had denied in the interview conducted by the police following his arrest that he had seen or looked at the photograph albums whilst he was in the car, and as he had denied knowledge of the white tablets, the appellant in his evidence at the trial gave an account inviting the conclusion that he had not removed any tablets from any photograph albums. He said that he met with Dinic for the purpose of picking up “the photo” (AB 112). He said that he entered the car and observed that there were boxes and bottles of drink and a lock for the steering on the seat so he threw them on the back seat. The appellant denied that Dinic handed anything to him in the car. 
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
     11 The grounds of appeal first filed were added to in a later document contained in the appeal book, which is undated but which appears at p 5 of the appeal book. Two further grounds were addressed in the appellant’s written submissions dated 12 October 2001. Then in a further document, received by the court on 23 October 2001, counsel for the appellant indicated that grounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the grounds referred to in the earlier written submissions of 12 October 2001 were not being pursued. 
     12 In the result, counsel identified three remaining grounds upon which the appellant relied: 
      
       
      (1) that his Honour erred in admitting evidence concerning the transfer of funds by the appellant overseas; 
       
       
      (2) that his Honour erred in refusing to allow further cross examination by the appellant of a witness named Suzanne Georgieve; 
       
       
      (3) that his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury as to lies. 
       
     13 Those grounds were addressed in written and oral submissions. 
     14 I will now consider each of these grounds in turn. 
      
       
      Ground 1:  
       
     15 The appellant has submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence that the appellant sent money to the man Dinic in Amsterdam. An application was made before the trial for the exclusion of the evidence as to this but the appellant’s application was unsuccessful. The reasons of the trial judge for the ruling that he made appear in the appeal book at pp 7-9. In admitting the evidence, his Honour ruled that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     16 The evidence in point was as follows: on 17 August 1995 the appellant sent to Petar Dinic in Amsterdam, Holland the sum of $6000. A record of this appeared in one of the exhibits at the trial in the form of a document entitled “Western Union Money Transfer”. Six days later there was a second transfer by the appellant to Petar Dinic, this time in the sum of $2000. Again the transfer was to Amsterdam, Holland and again there was a record of this in a document described as a “Western Union Money Transfer”. 
     17 It was submitted that the transfer of these two amounts to Dinic three months prior to the arrival in Australia of the package containing the drugs was too remote in point of time to assume relevance. Moreover, there was no evidence as to what the money was used for, nor as to what whoever paid for the drugs paid for them. The only evidence explaining the two transfers was an innocent explanation from the appellant later given at the trial. Moreover, whilst the money that the appellant sent to Dinic was sent to Amsterdam, the package was despatched from Eindhoven (a city some 110 kms from Amsterdam). With these considerations in mind, it was submitted that the evidence ought not to have been admitted and it had no probative value. Alternatively, any probative value it may have had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Mr Thangaraj submitted that there existed the danger that the evidence of the payments made months before the appellant’s arrest might be used impermissibly by the jury as indicating some previous drug transaction at about the time the payment was made. This risk, he submitted, amounted to danger of unfair prejudice. I do not regard that risk as being a real risk having regard to the evidence in this case. 
     18 The Crown case was one which depended essentially upon circumstantial evidence. The payment of these two sums of money three months before the arrival of the drugs was one aspect of the Crown case. The other features of the Crown case can be shortly summarised: 
      
       
      (i) there was the circumstance that the appellant met Dinic at the time and place referred to; 
       
       
      (ii) after the appellant had joined Dinic in the car Dinic was driving and it came to a halt, Dinic removed the box from the boot of the vehicle; 
       
       
      (iii) there were the observations of the appellant then referred to earlier in the outline of the Crown case concerning the appellant’s handling of one of the albums, the observation of the box in his lap and the position of the second album beside him on the console. Added to this was the evidence as to the manner in which both books had been disturbed and the finding of the tablets beside the seat that he was occupying; 
       
       
      (iv) there was the circumstance that the appellant was found to have over $7000 in cash in his possession. 
       
     19 The critical issue in the case, identified as such in the summing up (AB 155-156), was the issue of possession by the appellant: did the appellant have physical control of the drug with the requisite awareness? It seems to me that the evidence of the transfers to Dinic in Amsterdam was plainly relevant to, and had real probative value in, the context of the Crown case. The money was sent to the same man who met with the appellant at the very time when the ecstasy was found in the car in the circumstances outlined. The submission that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, considering prejudice in the relevant sense, should, in my opinion, be rejected. 
     20 In my opinion, ground 1 has not been established. 
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
     21 The Crown called Suzanne Georgieve at the trial but led no evidence from her apart from her name and address. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that her evidence assumed importance in his case because, consistently with what the appellant told the police after his arrest, he claimed that the meeting with Dinic was with a view to endeavouring to retrieve her brochures that he had spoken of to the police at the time of his interview. Presumably then, the Crown called the witness at the request of the appellant and thus made her available for cross examination by the appellant.  
     22 In cross examination the witness agreed that she had given a statement to the police to the effect that the appellant had assisted her in trying to sell some of her paintings. The witness said that she handed an album of photographs of her work to the appellant on the understanding that the album would be returned to her. In the course of her evidence the witness was asked this question and gave this answer at AB 70: 
      
       
        
        “Q. When was the last time you saw that album of photographs? 
         
        A. It was the day me and Mr Doncev went to Bondi to meet Pero.” 
         
        
       
     23 The transcript records that counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial then tendered the album identified by the witness and the subject of the above question and answer. The tender prompted the Crown Prosecutor to seek permission to ask a question on the voir dire. The appellant’s counsel took exception to this being done in the presence of the jury. His Honour then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is not necessarily the case that a voir dire has to be held in the absence of the jury.” 
         
        
       
     24 The judge then permitted the prosecutor to ask these questions, and the transcript records the questions as being asked on the voir dire (AB 72-73): 
      
       
        
        “Q. Is this actually the album that you handed over to Pero? 
         
        A. Yes it is. 
         
         
        Q. The very same? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. You got it back at some stage did you? 
         
        A. No I didn’t. 
         
         
        Q. These aren’t the actual pieces of plastic and the actual photographs that you handed over? 
         
        A. Yes it is because I have never got it back. 
         
         
        Q. You’ve brought this to court today, correct? 
         
        A. No it’s not that. 
         
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Between the time you gave it to Pero and when you were given it in the witness box, have you seen it? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. You haven’t had it? 
          
         A. No I didn’t.” 
          
         
        
       
     25 Following the above questioning, counsel for the appellant asked these questions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Maybe I should do this before I tender it [‘it’ presumably being the album tendered before the Crown Prosecutor asked the above questions], do you have another photographic album with you? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. Have you got it there now? 
          
         A. I’ve got it in my bag. 
          
          
         Q. Is it in the white plastic bag.” 
         
        
       
     26 His Honour then queried the need for the introduction of the second album: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Why does she need to get that out? 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         BAFFSKY: I’ll clear this up your Honour. The Crown has cross-examined his own witness in front of the jury on an important matter. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: She’s given the answer, she says she hasn’t seen that one from the time she gave it to Pero and when she was shown it in the witness box today. 
          
          
         BAFFSKY: I’m cross-examining this witness your Honour with respect, this is the way I would like to proceed. 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: I can’t see the relevance of asking her about some other thing which has got nothing to do with this case…” 
         
        
       
     27 Eventually his Honour gave this ruling (AB 74): 
      
       
        
         
         “I’m not going to allow it Mr Baffsky, she has given the answer and there’s nothing to contradict it and it’s quite clear what she said you haven’t got a problem lets get on with it.” 
         
        
       
     28 Thereafter the photo album tendered before the Crown Prosecutor’s questioning was admitted into evidence without objection. 
     29 Mr Thangaraj submitted that it was irregular for the Crown to have asked questions on the voir dire in the presence of the jury. He referred to s 189(4) of the Evidence Act. Moreover, he submitted that the Crown ought not to have been permitted to ask questions which took the form of cross examination. Neither of these points was taken as a discrete ground of appeal but it was not appropriate for the Crown to ask questions as though by way of cross examination without leave. However, I am not persuaded that the questions asked by the Crown were asked in such a way as to indicate a challenge to the credibility of the witness. Whether this be so or not, it does not seem to me that what occurred involved any risk of a miscarriage of justice. 
     30 The point of the ground of appeal presently being considered was the appellant’s complaint that he was prevented from seeking to introduce the second album into evidence or to ask further questions about it. I do not accept that there is any substance in this complaint. His Honour expressed his reasons before the jury for stopping the further questioning. The evidence that the witness had given to the effect that she had not seen the exhibited album between the time that she handed it over in October 1995 and the time that she saw it in the witness box was uncontradicted, as his Honour observed. I see no basis for apprehension that the questions asked may have discredited the witness in the minds of the jurors. I detect no error in the ruling that his Honour gave because the other album the witness had with her in the witness box was relevant to no issue at the trial. 
     31 In my opinion, this ground fails. 
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
     32 In the course of cross examination of the appellant, questions were asked of him which, it was submitted, gave rise to the need for the trial judge to give the jury instruction concerning the subject of “lies”. 
     33 Mr Thangaraj referred to the following extracts in the transcript concerning this ground: 
      
       
        
         
         [AB 121] 
          
         “Q. You lent him [Dinic] money because he was a very good friend of [y]ours? 
          
         A. Because I lend him many times before. 
          
          
         Q. Did you lend him many times because he was a very good friend of yours? 
          
         A. Yes…” 
         
        
       
       
      And linked with the above at AB 135: 
       
       
        
         
         “Q. You’d sent money to Mr Dinic in Amsterdam in order to pay for the drugs hadn’t you? 
          
         A. Is not true.” 
          
          
         [AB 121] 
          
         “Q. So when you told the police that you did not know his surname you were trying to protect him, is that right? 
          
         A. I say I been shocked and tired that time, I don’t know why I say that. 
          
          
         Q. You told the police because you wanted to distance yourself from him, didn’t you? 
          
         A. Distance?” 
          
          
         [AB 121] 
          
         “Q. You were actually there because you were going to get the drugs from Mr Dinic weren’t you? 
          
         A. No.” 
          
          
         [AB 122] 
          
         “Q. Might Mr Doncev be shown exhibit B please, the transcript of the record of interview. Mr Doncev would you look at question 212 please, which is on page 26 of the record of interview. Look first at question 211. You were asked by Mr Nelson, ‘why did you withdraw $10,000 yesterday?’ and the answer was, ‘for the races’, do you see that? 
          
         A. Yes...” 
         
        
       
       
      And linked with the above question at AB 123: 
       
       
        
         
         “Q. You had that money to pay to Mr Dinic, didn’t you on that night? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. No? 
          
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     34 It is clear from the above extracts from the evidence that the Crown Prosecutor cross examined the appellant upon the elements of the Crown case and elements as to which the appellant had proffered in evidence some innocent explanation. The cross examination went to the credibility of the appellant’s evidence in response to the circumstantial case presented against him. Had any of the responses in cross examination been relied upon by the Crown as some independent evidence of guilt in the sense discussed in Edwards v The Queen ((1993) 178 CLR 193 at 208 and following), then the need would have arisen for the jury to have been instructed concerning those matters to be considered, as identified in Edwards, before the jury could have used any such response or responses as going to the proof of the Crown case. However, whilst the appeal book does not contain a transcript of the final addresses of counsel, it appears to be clear that the jury was not asked to consider the responses in cross examination other than as going to credit. Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial did seek a direction as to lies, but the terms of his request indicate that the Crown Prosecutor had not invited the jury to use any alleged lies as probative of the Crown case. In seeking a direction on lies, counsel for the appellant said this (AB 176): 
      
       
        
         
         “And the third thing that I’d like to raise with your Honour is that the Crown in his address referred to both of the accused telling lies and the Crown of course also conceded that even if you found that, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re guilty and of course there’s a particular way the law deals with that issue. Would your Honour consider that direction…” 
         
        
       
     35 The way that the Crown put its case against the appellant is to be ascertained by reference to the summing up. In the course of the summing up, the trial judge instructed the jury that the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence and the judge later summarised the Crown case for the jury, identifying the circumstances upon which the Crown relied and also the appellant’s responses to these various circumstances (AB 169-173). The review of the elements of the Crown case contained no indication that the Crown was relying upon any alleged lie as probative of guilt. After identifying the various circumstances put forward by the Crown and the responses by the appellant, his Honour proceeded to give the following directions (and the instruction was given in the context of considering not only the case against the appellant but the case against the other accused, Dimitriyevich) (AB 173): 
      
       
        
         
         “Members of the jury once again I have attempted to summarise what the case is for the Crown in respect of Mr Doncev and what is said in response by Mr Doncev. You have heard Mr Doncev give evidence in the witness box. Once again if I have not referred to all of the evidence, either for the Crown or for Mr Doncev or to all of the matters that have been put to you by the Crown or by Mr Baffsky in respect of the case against Mr Doncev, do not think it is because I have deliberately ignored it or that it is not of any significance. You should pay attention to all of the matters that you have heard and all of the matters that have been put to you. Bear in mind when you consider those circumstances relied upon by the Crown that you may, if you think fit, rely upon some but perhaps not all of those circumstances as supporting the Crown case but  
         in the end in respect of…the accused it can only be if you think the only reasonable conclusion from those circumstances is as the Crown contends against…the accused, that you should find the accused guilty 
         . 
         
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to give some directions concerning the case against Dimitriyevich before returning to the case against the appellant. 
       
        
         
          
         In respect of Mr Doncev it will only be if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the circumstances relied upon by the Crown is that he was in possession of the drugs in the car in a sense to which I’ve referred to as possession 
         , that is that in the context of this case that he was knowingly taking apart that parcel so as to get the tablets, the ecstasy tablets out of the albums while he was in the car for that two or three minutes in Ocean Street  
         that you would find him guilty. If you think there is another reasonable explanation for the circumstances, or in respect of the circumstances that the Crown replies [sic] upon, whether it is the explanation given by Mr Doncev or some other explanation, then you will find him not guilty 
         .” 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     36 It does not appear to have been any part of the Crown case to rely upon any allegedly untruthful response by the appellant as affording proof of his guilt and I do not consider that the appellant has established that there was a need in this case for an Edwards direction as to lies. 
     37 Mr Thangaraj submitted that even if that be so, the trial judge should have given a direction such as was expressed in Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 245. 
     38 The present case is very different from Zoneff. In Zoneff the accused appeared unrepresented at his trial by jury on charges of false pretences and fraudulent conversion. He gave evidence denying the charges and the Crown Prosecutor cross examined him. The questioning attributed lies to the appellant. The Crown Prosecutor did not address the jury. In his summing up the judge gave a direction to the jury concerning the significance of lies, referring to the possibility that the telling of lies indicated a consciousness of guilt but reminding the jury, consistently with Edwards, that there were many reasons why people lie, some of which are not consistent with guilt. The prosecution had not presented the case as one in which the jury would be entitled to treat lies found as probative of guilt. The convictions of the appellant were quashed and a new trial was ordered because it was determined that the Edwards direction should not have been given. 
     39 In their joint judgment in Zoneff, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at 245 (paras 20-21): 
      
       
        
         
         “It follows in our opinion that it was unnecessary, indeed undesirable, that a direction of the kind with which Edwards was concerned be given in the circumstances of this case. In order to give it in this case the trial judge would have had to decide which of the appellant’s answers were or were not capable of being regarded as lies indicative of a consciousness of guilt. Such a direction here could have had the effect of raising an issue or issues upon which the parties were not joined, and of highlighting issues of credibility so as to give them an undeserved prominence in the jury’s mind to the prejudice of the appellant. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Because the Crown did not put, either in cross-examination or in any submission at the trial that there was any material capable of being regarded as a lie stemming from a consciousness of guilt, the direction that the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal quoted and which is set out above, should not have been given.”  
         
        
       
     40 Their Honours went on to express the terms of the direction which Mr Thangaraj submitted, (in the alternative), should have been given in the present case but did so in the following context: 
      
       
        
         
         “The trial judge was evidently concerned that, having regard to some of the cross-examination, there was a serious risk that the jury might engage in an impermissible process of reasoning in relation to the matter of lies. Unfortunately, his response was to give a direction which, as Olsson J observed, raised the topic and then left it largely up in the air. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         A direction which might have appropriately been given and which would have allayed any concerns which the trial judge may have had, in this unusual case, in which the issues may not have been defined as they might have been had the prosecutor made a speech to the jury, is one in these terms: 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.’ 
          
         
        
       
     41 It is to be observed that, unlike Zoneff, the present case was one in which the Crown Prosecutor had addressed the jury and in which the issues were defined for the jury, as reflected in the summary of the Crown case in the summing up. 
     42 The court did not decide in Zoneff that the direction then suggested should be given in every case in which questioning of an accused by the Crown Prosecutor attacked his credit. Having expressed the direction, their Honours went on to say (at para 24): 
      
       
        
         
         “A direction in such terms may well be adaptable to other cases in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence.” 
         
        
       
     43 Returning to the present case, in declining to give any direction concerning lies, the trial judge said (AB 177): 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: I am not going to give the direction on lies, Mr Baffsky. I think that just completely confuses the issue quite frankly.” 
         
        
       
     44 In my opinion, his Honour’s refusal did not involve error. I am not persuaded that there was, in the circumstances of this case, a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of any answers here given in cross examination if the jury found such answers to be untruthful. The jury had been given instruction in the summing up, and in particular in the passage set out at para 35 above, which sufficiently alerted the jury as to how it should go about its task in this case. 
     45 This Court was referred to R v GJH [2001] NSWCCA 128, a case in which a new trial was ordered, inter alia, upon the ground that the judge had failed to give appropriate directions on the subject of lies. On appeal the Crown conceded that some of the matters focussed on by the Crown Prosecutor at the trial did address the issue of consciousness of guilt. The need for the jury to be assisted by the judge by appropriate instructions on lies was made apparent in the analysis by Wood CJ at CL of the final address of the Crown Prosecutor, where his Honour said (at para 64): 
      
       
        
         
         “Few if any of the ‘lies’ identified related to a material aspect, being very much concerned with peripheral detail. The clear and strong thrust of what the Crown Prosecutor was putting, however, was that the appellant ‘would sooner slide off a question than face up to it and answer it’, because he had a ‘guilty conscience’, because he knew ‘he had a lot to hide’ and because he knew ‘ultimately that the truth (would) reveal his guilt.’ 
         
        
       
     46 The present case, to my mind, is clearly distinguishable from GJH. 
     47 Mr Thangaraj also referred to the decision of this court in R v Patterson [2001] NSWCCA 316. Having considered this decision, it does not seem to me that it assists the appellant. This was a case in which the appellant was charged with being knowingly concerned with the importation of prohibited imports in contravention of s 223B(1) of the Customs Act. The issue in the case was whether the appellant knew that what was being imported was a prohibited drug; the appellant’s contention was he believed he was involved in a legitimate importation of equipment. The appellant gave detailed evidence of his involvement in the importation and the Crown response was that the whole account was a fabrication. The judge, in summing up, referred to many alleged lies the subject of submissions in the Crown Prosecutor’s final address, but the judge gave no direction to the jury on lies and it was submitted on appeal that there should either have been a direction of the type discussed in Edwards concerning consciousness of guilt, or at the very least a more general direction as discussed in Zoneff. Those submissions were rejected and, in the course of his judgment, Hodgson JA, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “In my opinion, in submitting that these aspects of the evidence were unbelievable and were lies, the Crown was not relying on the lies purely as going to the credit of the appellant, or as disclosing consciousness of guilt, but rather as part of what the Crown contended to be an unbelievable account of the appellant’s involvement. A finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty necessarily required a finding that the history he gave was a deliberate fabrication; and on the other hand, a finding that the history was a deliberate fabrication meant, in my opinion, that there could not be a rational decision other than that he knew the importation was of cannabis. Because the other evidence in the case very strongly supported an inference of knowledge, the additional circumstance of a deliberately false account of his understanding and involvement in the transaction could not in my opinion, be given any rational explanation consistent with innocence. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         So, for those reasons, it seems to me that lies in his case were not relied on either as affecting credibility or as showing consciousness of guilt, but rather as matters going directly to the essential issue. In my opinion it was sufficient in this case that the judge made it abundantly clear that there was no onus on the accused to prove anything, and that the Crown had to prove every element in the case, including the appellant’s knowledge, beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
     48 Patterson affords no support for the submission that the jury should here have been instructed concerning lies. 
     49 In my opinion, ground 3 has not been established. 
     50 In the result I consider that this appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     51 IRELAND AJ: I agree with Studdert J for the reasons given by his Honour.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONIRELAND AJFriday, 2 November, 200170036/01 - REGINA v Paul Geoffrey HILLSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 1 June 2001 the offender, Paul Geoffrey Hill, was arraigned on a charge that he, together with his co-accused Leanne Charmaine Eriksson, on 27 April 2000 at Westmead murdered the deceased, Tristen Michael Allen Lane, to whom I shall refer as Tristen. To this charge pleas of not guilty were entered by both accused.2 On 20 August the offender, Leanne Eriksson, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Tristen, who was her son. The basis of the plea was manslaughter by criminal negligence in failing to obtain medical treatment for Tristen who had suffered injury and in failing to remove Tristen from the danger of injury by separating from her co-accused, Paul Hill, with whom she was in a defacto relationship.3 At the time of entering her guilty plea, the offender Leanne Eriksson undertook to give evidence against the offender Paul Hill. She was sentenced on 7 September 2001 with the proposed assistance to authorities being taken into account.4 On 1 September 2001 the offender Paul Hill pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. This plea was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction and discharge of the indictment.5 The Crown case against the offender on sentence, proceeds on two bases: firstly that his acts caused the death of Tristen and that those acts were both unlawful and dangerous; secondly that he was guilty of criminal negligence in his failure to obtain necessary medical assistance and treatment.6 It is contended on behalf of the offender that Tristen, a two year old child, suffered a number of non-accidental injuries ultimately leading to his death. There is also no issue that failure on the part of the offender to obtain necessary medical assistance and treatment amounts to criminal negligence.7 The issues for determination on sentence include whether a number of assaults alleged to be by the offender upon Tristen caused a “constellation of injuries” including that which subsequently caused his death, and whether such alleged injuries, were in the circumstances, aggravating features relevant to sentence. Both those issues require proof beyond reasonable doubt.8 It is common ground that the injuries sustained by Tristen must have been occasioned by the deliberate act of either Paul Hill or Leanne Eriksson.9 The background events leading to the death of Tristen include the following:10 The deceased, Tristen Michael Allen Lane, was born to Leanne Eriksson and Michael Allen Lane at King George V Hospital, Sydney on 1 March 1998.11 He was two years and two months old at time of death. A few months after Tristen’s birth, the relationship between Leanne Eriksson and Michael Lane ended and they separated. At that time they also had another child, Joshua, born 29 August 1995.12 Following separation from Michael Lane, Leanne Eriksson maintained custody of the two children residing with them at various addresses, including the home of her grandparents at Blue Haven on the Central Coast.13 In February 2000 when the offender and her two children were residing at a guest house at 101 Queen Street, Ashfield, a relationship developed between Leanne Eriksson and the offender, who at that time, resided with his sister, Amanda Hill, in a large block of residential units at Golden Grove Street, Darlington.14 At about that time, Michael Lane took custody of the child Joshua. The offender moved into room 19, 101 Queen Street, Ashfield where he resided with Leanne Eriksson and Tristen. A number of residents of those premises, a boarding house, from time to time overheard abusive language used by the offender towards Tristen and heard noises consistent with the child being slapped, followed by Tristen crying. 15 In the period from approximately the end of March until 13 April 2000 Leanne Eriksson and her son Tristen lived with the offender at his father’s home in Mount Druitt. On 14 April, the offender, Leanne Eriksson and Tristen moved in with the offender’s sister, Amanda Hill to unit 50/11 Golden Grove Street, Darlington.16 In this large complex of residential units also resided Leanne Eriksson’s half-sisters, Shonna and Julia Parker, and their close friend Kylie Quinn.17 Other close friends were Susie Tavares and Dominic Natoli.18 Comprehensive statements, which form part of Exhibit “A” on sentence, have been furnished by these young people, who plainly took a close interest in Tristen.19 What is said by them and by other persons, who have made statements to investigating police, satisfies me to the relevant degree that, following commencement of the relationship between Leanne Eriksson and the offender, Tristen was subjected to rough handling and physical abuse by the offender which was evident in bruising and abrasions observed by Shonna and Julie Parker and in particular Susie Tavares and Kylie Quinn.20 The rough and inappropriate handling of Tristen by the offender including the dropping and throwing of him from height onto a bed in the face of strong objection and adverse reaction by the child.21 The offender exhibited dislike of Tristen which was obvious to others, as was also Tristen’s fear of the offender.22 I am further satisfied that although Leanne Eriksson was from time to time less than diligent in her supervision and motherly care for Tristen, she was not violent towards him and was not responsible for physical injury to him.23 On about Friday 14 April 2000 when residing with the offender’s sister at Golden Grove Street, an incident occurred in which Tristen suffered a spiral fracture of the left tibia. The offender has given inconsistent versions of events associated with this incident.24 In his ERISP of 25 April 2000, he told police that he returned home at about 8.30 pm and that Leanne told him that Tristen had fallen down the stairs. In his evidence given on 19 September 2001 the offender was asked in chief the question: (T.137.15) “Q. What time did you come home? 
     
      
       
        A. Well I’m always in and out, so it would have been between 11, 12, and 12.30. 
        
        Q. Can you tell us what happened when you got home at that time? 
        
        A. I came up to the stairs at Golden Grove Street, going home to my sister’s place and when I walked into the house I seen Tristen on the floor at the bottom of my sister’s stairs. I walked in and I looked at him, seen what he was doing.  
        
        Q. How did he appear at that time? 
        
        A. He didn’t look like he could get up. 
        
        Q. When you say the bottom of the stairs is that inside the unit? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. And is that in the bedroom area of the unit? 
        
        A. No it’s at the front of the two bedrooms. 
        
        Q. What happened then? 
        
        A. I looked him over, because he didn’t look like he could get up, so I picked him up. I took him upstairs to the lounge-room. Leanne I think was already there, or coming from the balcony, and I asked her what had happened to Tristen and when she came in I checked his leg. I asked him to stand up. Tristen couldn’t stand up, so I said to Leanne, I said “There’s got to be something wrong with his leg”. Because I’ve felt it, and when I felt it it was swollen. 
        
        Q. Was the child distressed at that time? 
        
        A. He was a bit whingey when I grabbed his leg. 
        
        Q. What happened then? 
        
        A. Then I kept checking his leg over, I turned it to the right, and then I turned it to the left, and then straight again, and I heard a little clicking noise. So I said to Leanne, “There’s got to be something wrong with his leg”. Leanne ran outside and got a bandage off - I don’t know who she got the bandage off.” 
        
         
       
      
    25 The offender’s evidence in chief is consistent with the evidence of Leanne Eriksson, who described being told by the offender the following: “I found him [Tristen] down the bottom of the stairs. When I picked him up I heard something crack” 
     
      
       
        . 
       
      
    26 Leanne Eriksson also gave evidence that the offender’s niece, Tyler, was present at this time. Tyler was a child of some six years of age. When she endeavoured to describe events which tendered to inculpate the offender, she was silenced by the offender.27 On Saturday, 15 April 2000 Tristen was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he was diagnosed as having sustained a spiral fracture of the left tibia. Dr Dihn, who cared for Tristen upon his admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 15 April, detected no other injuries at that time.28 At post mortem, in addition to the fractured tibia, there were established fractures to the right humerus above the elbow and to the right seventh and eighth ribs, as well as the left scapula and clavicle. A number of abrasions, lesions and bruises were observed to the head, chest and limbs, as well as internal abdominal haemorrhaging. The direct cause of death was a subdural brain haemorrhage. 29 On Tuesday, 18 April 2000 Leanne Eriksson left Tristen in the care of Paul Hill for a period of some forty five minutes while she went to the nearby shops. On her return she inquired as to how Tristen was and received, inter alia, the reply “I done something”. Upon further enquiry the offender said “I couldn’t handle him crying. I threw him onto the corner of the lounge and he hit his head”.30 The sequence of events which followed as set forth in the statement of witnesses and the material tendered makes it plain beyond question that Tristen’s condition deteriorated thereafter. By Wednesday, 19 April he was speaking very little; regurgitating such food as he was able to eat; had lost mobility and the use of the right side of his body. 31 The credibility of the offender has been challenged by the Crown as has that of Leanne Eriksson by Mr Zahra, senior counsel for the offender.32 The credibility of Leanne Eriksson has been the subject of careful analysis in helpful written and oral submissions by Mr Zahra. It is apparent that at a time when she was in love with the offender, and desired to continue and develop her relationship with him, that she gave to hospital staff and authorities versions of events which sought to exculpate the offender.33 I am satisfied that the offender was the dominant partner in their relationship and that in failing to seek medical attention for Tristen, Ms Eriksson was largely influenced by the offender and the dire consequences he encouraged her to believe would flow from any investigation by authorities of the origin of the child’s injuries.34 I am nevertheless satisfied that in making her statement of 21 August 2001, and in giving her evidence before me on 12 and 13 September 2001, Ms Eriksson was endeavouring to tell the truth to the best of her ability and recollection.35 I do not accept the offender as a witness of truth. His denial of any maltreatment of Tristen and his denial of a close and intimate relationship with Leanne Eriksson are both contradicted by the unchallenged statements of independent witnesses to whom I have referred with regard to his conduct and by the letters which he wrote to Ms Eriksson as to the depth of his feelings and affection for her.36 On Thursday, 20 April 2000, the day appointed for Tristen to see a specialist orthopaedic surgeon at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, with regard to his fractured tibia, he was taken instead to the Royal Easter Show. On that occasion, Tristen was observed by those present to be in a very poor state of health. He rejected food and was suffering from loss of mobility. Tristen’s condition did not improve over the Friday and Saturday and on Sunday morning, 23 April, he began fitting. He was placed in the bath and attempts were made by Paul Hill to give him cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. An ambulance was summoned by the offender and at about 10.50 a.m. Tristen was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.37 The medical evidence is consistent with Tristen sustaining a major head injury on 18 April 2000. Doctor Langlois expressed the opinion that the constellation of injuries noted during autopsy would have been inflicted ten to fourteen days before the autopsy, that is to say between 14 and 18 April 2000. The fractures had formed callus, which indicated that they were more than seven days old. Professor Harper, Professor of Neuropathology, from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the University of Sydney, was of the same opinion.38 I accept it to be common ground between the medical experts that Tristen sustained further trauma to the head shortly prior to his admission to hospital on 23 April 2000. It is not possible to say precisely when this final injury occurred.39 Doctor Neil Langlois, forensic pathologist, is of the opinion that the time interval between trauma and leakage of the cerebro-spinal fluid, which was found upon admission, could range from almost instantaneous to a matter of hours.40 Doctor Gregory Rowle, paediatric specialist, expressed the opinion that Tristen sustained a major injury on the day of his admission to hospital and that it was very likely that there was then a pre-existing brain injury.41 Doctor Rowle expressed the opinion that the oedema or swelling of the brain, which caused the brain stem injury leading to cardiac arrest, developed in a matter of minutes and led to an arrest within the space of at most a few hours following the injury.42 When asked to encapsulate the complete picture which he saw as a result of the whole of the history, that is to say the medical history relating to treatment, Professor Harper said this: “I believe between ten and fourteen days before this child died something happened which stopped the oxygen to his brain at the same time he suffered a head injury, which resulted in him developing a subdural haematoma. The lack of oxygen has caused very, very severe brain damage to the extent that had nothing else happened to this child he would have been permanently debilitated and would have been virtually a vegetable. Certainly within four days of the death based mostly upon other evidence, not my own evidence, it appears the child suffered a second injury which resulted in a fracture of the petrous temporal bone, which caused leakage of CSF, and given the leakage I saw within the older subdural haematoma it is also likely that resulted from his old head injury. 
     
      
       
         
        
        The combination of both, of the brain damage or oedema, there is absolutely no space left within the skull for the brain to continue to function or for the blood to flow into the brain and that forced the brain down through the base of the skull, it is called the foramen magnum, and that is the site where our bodies meet and respiration is controlled, and if you compress that, everything stops and that is the final common pathway of this child’s death.” 
        
         
       
      
    43 I am satisfied that within a period, probably of the order of four hours, prior to admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 23 April 2000, Tristen sustained a second injury which caused the oedema which, in turn, resulted in cardiac arrest. This second injury may be considered to be the direct cause of death.44 The events which took place on the morning of 23 April are to be gleaned from the evidence of Ms Eriksson and the offender.45 I do not propose to review that evidence in detail. Suffice it to say that it does not, in my view, permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted a further injury on that occasion so as to constitute manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.46 The evidence makes plain, however, that over a period of some five days the offender failed to seek, for the child Tristen medical assistance and treatment of which he was obviously in dire need, and further that he influenced Ms Eriksson to do likewise.47 I am further satisfied on the criminal standard that on 18 April 2000 the offender so injured the child Tristen as to cause the multiple injuries, with the exception of the prior fracture to the tibia, as were disclosed on post mortem examination, as well as the brain damage of such severity as to result in the degree of permanent debilitation described by Professor Harper as “virtually a vegetable”. When taken together with the influence exercised by the offender to deter Ms Eriksson from seeking medical treatment, these are circumstances of the gravest aggravation.  The subjective considerations48 Subjectively, the offender, who was born on 27 April 1977, is presently aged twenty four and a half years. He was aged 23 years at the time of the offence.49 The offender disclosed to Ms Mary Anderson, clinical psychologist, that he was brought up in Sydney in a family which included his mother, two sisters and a step-father. The offender did not see his natural father while he was growing up, but has been in touch with him since. He described his step-father as “violent when we were young kids”. His mother and step-father are still together.50 The offender resented being disciplined by his step-father and joined his friends in truanting from school, although he continued at school until year 10 at Newtown High.51 The offender described himself to Ms Anderson as getting into “… a lot of trouble with police and with my mouth”. The offender’s criminal history dates back to 1993 and relates a series of offences, some of a minor nature, others more serious resulting in the imposition of control orders and periods in custody. In 1999 the offender was indicted on an assault charge for which punishment was imposed. In 2000 he was convicted on charges of maliciously destroying or damaging property, and for having goods in his custody reasonably suspected of being stolen. In that year also there were convictions for break, enter and steal and for common assault.52 The offender has used alcohol and marijuana from the age of 13 years and associates his alcohol use with his more aggressive offences. He commenced an apprenticeship as a chef, however, his brief employment ceased due to the need for time off for court appearances and no doubt their consequences. He has worked as a removalist and apparently holds a fork-lift driver’s licence. The offender has a daughter from an earlier relationship. Whilst the offender admits to alcohol abuse from an early age, he claims to have, on various occasions, been able to stop using alcohol on his own volition. He has done various drug and alcohol courses in the past and I note that three, two hour courses have been attended by him in December and January last, as well as an anger management course in March of this year.53 Although the basis upon which the manslaughter of Tristen Lane is that of criminal negligence in both the case of the offender and Leanne Eriksson, in her case the absence of the serious aggravating features to which I have referred; her early plea and her assistance to authorities renders parity of sentence irrelevant.54 Whilst the degree of criminality in manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act is at a more serious level than that of criminal negligence, the gravity of the aggravating circumstances in the present case mandate condign punishment.55 Considerations of personal and general deterrence are also of importance to deter like minded individuals. The rehabilitation of the offender, bearing in mind his youthful age is to be considered. I also take into account that the nature of the offence may mean that the offender will serve his sentence or part of it in protective custody.56 There has been no expression of contrition or remorse other than in the bare plea itself. The plea of guilty was a late plea made after the co-offender’s plea at a time when she had undertaken to give evidence against the offender. The offender is entitled to some discount for the utilitarian benefits to the community, which I assess at approximately 11%, being at the low end of the scale recognised in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton (2000 NSW CCA 309 -17.8.00)57 I do not consider there to have been anything of an exceptional kind in the aboriginality or upbringing of the offender that calls for particular mitigation of sentence. R v Pitt (2001 NSW CCA 156).58 No submissions have been made that there are special circumstances which would warrant variation of the statutory ratio of sentence and non-parole period and in my view there are no circumstances which would justify a variation. 59 In R v Blacklidge (NSW CCA 12.12.95) at 4 Gleeson CJ said this: “… the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. (R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1991) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402).” 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    60 The starting point in the present case, taking into account the matters to which I have made reference, is a sentence of 9 years imprisonment. A reduction of approximately 11% for the plea of guilty reduces this figure to 8 years. The offender has been in custody, referable to this offence, since the date of his arrest on 25 May 2000.61 Paul Geoffrey Hill on the charge of manslaughter to which you have pleaded guilty and have been convicted, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years commencing on 25 May 2000 and expiring on 24 May 2008. There will be a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 25 May 2000 and expiring on 24 May 2006 on which date you will be eligible for release to parole. **********

        REGINA v Thamir SAKO 
        
       
      
      
      Judgment 
     1    SPIGELMAN CJ:  I agree with Simpson J.2    SIMPSON J: On 17 May 2000 the appellants Edward Esho and Thamir Sako were indicted on a number of charges arising out of an incident that occurred at Fairfield, NSW, on 18 April 1997. During the course of the incident a police officer, Constable David Carty, was killed. The primary charge Esho faced was murder. In the alternative he was charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so (a charge laid under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900). He was additionally charged with an offence of threatening unlawful violence towards another person by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his safety. (This charge, laid under s 93C (1) of the Crimes Act, is shortly known as a charge of affray). By s 34 of the Crimes Act a jury which is satisfied that a person charged under s 33 is guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm but is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person had the necessary intent, may acquit of that charge but convict of an alternative offence of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, an offence under s 35 of the Crimes Act. (The only distinction between the two offences is the presence, in the s 33 offence, of the express element of intent to do grievous bodily harm, and its absence in the s 35 offence.) 
      
       
     3    Sako was charged under s 33 with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so, and with affray. Three other men were charged with various offences arising out of the incident. 
      
       
     4    On 5 September 2000, after a four month trial, the jury returned its verdicts. The three other men were acquitted of all charges. Esho was acquitted of murder, acquitted of the charge under s 33, but convicted of its alternative under s 35, and was also convicted of the offence of affray. Sako was acquitted of the s 33 charge, and of affray, but was also convicted of the s 35 alternative. 
      
       
     5    For an offence against that section, s 35 prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. S 93C(1) prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years for an offence of affray. Abadee J sentenced Sako (who was convicted only of the s 35 charge) to imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of three years and nine months. On the s 35 conviction he sentenced Esho to imprisonment for six years and eight months with a non-parole period of five years; on the affray count he imposed a concurrent sentence of a fixed term of two years. 
      
       
     6    Both appellants appeal against their convictions and seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
      
       
        
       The Crown Case 
        
       
     7    The Crown case was that, during the early hours of the morning of 18 April 1997, Constable Carty, who had spent some time in the Cambridge Tavern at Fairfield after finishing duty, left the hotel and was set upon and attacked by a group of about ten or twelve young Assyrian men. He was fatally stabbed in the neck and fell to the ground. A number of the men then kicked and punched him and stomped on his head, chest and torso. 
      
       
     8    Earlier in the evening, while he was on duty and patrolling a Fairfield street, Constable Carty had cautioned Esho about his use of offensive language. Constable Simon Clark was present at this encounter. Esho was heard to shout, from the opposite side of the road “fucking pig”. Constable Carty, in the presenc`e of Constable Clark, rebuked him.  
      
       
     9    Later in the evening, a number of police officers, including Constable Carty, gathered at the Cambridge Tavern. A large number of Assyrian men were seen in the car park, and walking in and out of the Tavern. Both Esho and Sako were among these men. Sako’s brother, Thaier Sako, was another. Also present were two brothers called Gilbert and Richard Adam. 
      
       
     10    At about 2.15 am Constable Carty left the Tavern in company with Constables Michele Auld and Craig Spencer and walked to his car. He was confronted by Thaier Sako. Other Assyrian men were nearby. Thaier Sako pushed Constable Carty in the chest, causing him to step back. Constable Carty recovered his balance and pushed Thaier Sako in a similar fashion. A scuffle broke out involving Constable Carty, Thaier Sako, Esho and Gilbert Adam. One of the Assyrian men produced and used a knife, as a result of which Thaier Sako was stabbed and injured. He bled copiously and this caused some of the other men, including Esho, to believe (wrongly) that he had been fatally injured. As a result, a number of men who had been in the hotel joined the group in the car park and joined the attack on Constable Carty. During this time Constable Carty was stabbed in the heart. This wound was fatal. He fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, a number of the men present punched him, kicked him, and stomped on his head, chest and other parts of his body. Esho, Gilbert Adam and another eight or ten men participated in this part of the occurrence.  
      
       
        
       The evidence 
        
       
     11    Constable Michele Auld had been among the off duty police officers in the Cambridge Tavern with Constable Carty. She, Constable Spencer, and Constable Carty left together at between 2.00 and 2.15 am and walked to their respective cars which were parked in different parts of the car park. Constable Auld was sitting in the driver’s seat of her car and saw a man of Arabic appearance (Thaier Sako) approach Constable Carty who was near the door of his car. She saw an encounter between the two men but did not hear any conversation. She then saw about eight or ten young men of Arabic appearance join the first, and stand around Constable Carty in a semi-circle. These included Esho and Gilbert Adam. The conversation increased in volume, and was accompanied by hand gestures, but she still could not hear any words. She saw an Arabic man (Thaier Sako) push Constable Carty in the chest, and saw Constable Carty fall back, and then push Thaier Sako. She saw a look of horror on Constable Carty’s face, and a large amount of blood spurting from the region of his chest. She realised that the incident was serious and ran to the bar where she made a telephone call seeking police assistance. She returned to the car park. Constable Carty was lying on his back on the ground. The men, including Thaier Sako were kicking at various parts of his body. Constable Carty’s body was moving. Some of the men began to punch various parts of his body with closed fists. Constable Auld attempted to push the men away. One of them punched her on the right cheek. She continued her attempts to push the men away and was hit again, on the side of her head. By this time Constable Carty’s body was moving only when kicked or punched.  
      
       
     12    Trevor Davies was a bakery worker who had gone, with a friend, to the Tavern at about 11.30 pm. He was aware of a group of police officers sitting behind him. A group of men of Middle Eastern appearance entered the bar and, after being spoken to by the barman, left. One of them returned to the bar and made a number of gestures, including a throat slashing gesture, and a tugging gesture with clenched hands held together. He appeared aggressive. 
      
       
     13    Mr Davies later became aware of the disturbance outside and watched it from a window. He said he saw “a group of men beating up on one man”. There were about six or seven in the group. They were kicking and punching the other man. The one man remained standing for about two minutes and then fell. Once he had fallen Mr Davies could not see him, but said that the men “appeared to be jumping on whatever was there”. He described the manner of jumping as “stomping”. He saw another man (Thaier Sako) being half dragged and half carried to the entrance of one of the hotel bars. The men who had been kicking and stomping on Constable Carty continued to do so for approximately four minutes. They then began to move away, but one turned back and continued the stomping action. Initially, he was restrained by others in the group, but succeeded in returning to where Constable Carty was lying and continued with the stomping action. Mr Davies described this man’s manner of stomping as “aggressive”.  
      
       
     14    Michael Batterham was a work colleague of Mr Davies and accompanied him to the Cambridge Tavern. He saw about fifteen or twenty men of Middle Eastern appearance enter the public bar where he and Mr Davies were, and pass into an adjoining bar, the Casino Bar. About fifteen or twenty minutes later his attention was attracted by two men in the parking lot near a small white car. He saw a man lunge towards another, and then another man behind him (the man who lunged). The first man fell down and the third man seemed to be stomping on the man on the ground. A few seconds later the men were joined by about five or six others. Mr Batterham heard one of the men call out “I’ll kill the bastard” or words to that effect.  
      
       
     15    Tony Bakos was sixteen years of age in 1997. He was called to give evidence in the Crown case but his evidence quickly proved to be unfavourable to the Crown, and inconsistent with statements he had previously made. The trial judge was satisfied that he was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence on matters of which he may reasonably have been supposed to have knowledge and, accordingly, on the application of the Crown Prosecutor, the trial judge granted leave to question him as though cross-examining. (The grant of leave is the subject of one of the grounds of appeal.) 
     16    The account of the events that was attributed to Bakos was derived essentially from an interview he gave to police on 9 June 1997. He participated in this interview at his own request. He had participated in two earlier interviews (9 and 28 May). According to what he said in June 1997, it was he who had initiated the contact with police and he did this because he wished to provide further information about the events of 18 April. The transcript of the interview of 9 June records him as saying, inter alia:  
      
       
        
         
         “When it started, like Gibby [this was a reference to Gilbert Adam] started jumpin’ like punchin’ in like the copper, he was punchin’ him and like Thaier Terry went in to … there and like he just comes out not even, I’d done a, seconds, just comes out like holding his neck you know like he was just going, ah, screaming. Then after the, the policeman dropped, when he was dropped, dropped to Gibby was the like the lady, the lady copper, she was screaming. He just turned around and just went like, in her face. She just --- … like, she, he just kicked in her face, you know, and knocked her out on the ground.” 
         
        
       
     17    During the last interview, Bakos told police that Esho had asked Constable Carty: 
      
       
        
         
         “Why you tell me to shut up?” 
         
        
        
       referring to the earlier encounter at Fairfield. 
        
       
     18    Dennis Oshana was, in 1997, a friend of both appellants. He had been in Fairfield during the encounter between Constable Carty and Esho earlier in the evening, and was also at the Cambridge Tavern. He observed the two men in the car park arguing. He saw a number of people, some of whom he knew, near where Constable Carty was standing. He gave some evidence of what then occurred. When asked if he saw some movement of feet around Constable Carty he replied “sort of”, and described the movement as “jumping around kind of thing”. When asked if anybody was making contact with Constable Carty he said “probably”, and gave a similar answer when asked if the “jumping” was “kicking”.  
      
       
     19    After Oshana gave some more evidence, the Crown Prosecutor applied, under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1975, for leave to question him as though cross-examining. Leave was granted on the basis that his evidence was unfavourable to the Crown and that he had made a prior inconsistent statement (s 38(1)(a) and (c)). The remainder of Oshana’s evidence was given from a statement he had made to police on 23 January 1998. Included in that statement were the following passages: 
      
       
        
         
         “I could see people were kicking the policeman, but I can’t tell which one of these people were kicking the policeman. There was legs going everywhere and they were moving around the policeman.” 
         
        
        
         
         “I remember that Eddy [Esho] was screaming and swearing at the policeman and he’d looked like he lost it.” 
         
        
        
         
         “Eddie was the one who kept saying ‘He killed my brother, he killed my brother’. He also said ‘He killed Thaier’.” 
         
        
       
     20    Oshana was then cross-examined about evidence he had given in committal proceedings on 28 January 1998 and 27 October 1998. On that occasion he said that he had seen Constable Carty lying on the ground shaking, and that people were kicking him with “a lot of force”. He had then described what Michele Auld was doing, and said that the kicking continued. He again described the men encircling Constable Carty and kicking him with force. 
      
       
     21    Medical evidence of the injuries sustained by Constable Carty was given by Dr Peter Ellis, the Director of Forensic Medicine at Westmead Hospital. Apart from the stab wound to the chest which he identified as the direct cause of death, Dr Ellis described wounds, abrasions, lacerations and bruises to Constable Carty’s body. Among other injuries he described an incised wound at the front of the head which could have been caused by a sharp edged object; bruising to the top of the head consistent with having been caused by kicking: an incised wound above the eyebrow caused by a sharp object such as a knife; curved abrasion on the left side of the head; bruising and an abrasion above the left ear, described by the doctor as a combination of various forms of blunt trauma consistent with having been caused by a circular object such as a beer bottle, applied with significant force; further abrasions in the same area, caused by blunt trauma, consistent with kicking or possibly punching; an incised wound to the left of the face, caused by a sharp edged probably straight object that had the effect of cutting off part of the earlobe; two further incised wounds to the left ear, again consistent with having been caused by a sharp edged object which may have been a knife or a piece of glass or similar; bruising and abrasion on the left cheek; a fairly deep incised wound to the left side of the nose, causing the nose to be cut through, and penetrating to the mid part of the nose, again caused by a sharp object such as a sharp blade of a knife, or broken glass; a number of small abrasions around the left eye, caused by blunt trauma consistent with kicking or punching; an abrasion above the right ear caused by the application of blunt force sufficient to tear the skin; a similar injury to the right cheek; a “scalping” wound to the back of the head, removing the surface of the skin and a tear, possibly caused by a sharp machete; and a shallow wound at the top of the back, possibly caused by a knife or broken glass, or sharp edged machete.  
      
       
     22    Scientific evidence established that items of clothing worn by both appellants contained blood, the DNA of which was consistent with that of Constable Carty. Shoes and socks work by both appellants bore blood that was, or could have been, that of Constable Carty. 
      
       
     23    Both appellants were interviewed by police on 18 April 1997. Esho was further interviewed on 11 November. Each interview was electronically recorded. In the earlier interview Esho denied having been outside the Tavern, and denied having seen any incident in the carpark. 
      
       
     24    In addition to participating in the interview, Sako took part with police in a “walk around” of the Tavern on the same day. This was video-recorded. He denied any involvement in the events in the carpark. 
      
       
     25    Esho gave evidence in the trial. He acknowledged that his answers to police in the interview (saying he had not been present outside the Tavern, and had not observed any incident) were untrue, but said that he had given untrue answers because of fear of possible retaliation by the Adam brothers. 
      
       
     26    Sako did not give evidence in the trial. One medical witness (Dr Collins) called on behalf of another co-accused, when cross-examined by Sako’s counsel, said that had Sako been involved in kicking Constable Carty, he would have expected to see more blood than was shown to have been present on his shoes.

     27    The argument in this court proceeded on the basis that there had been two distinct phases in the altercation, the first beginning with the confrontation between Constable Carty and Thaier Sako, with some other men in the near vicinity, looking on and subsequently becoming involved. It was during this “phase” that the fatal stab wound was inflicted on Constable Carty, although it did not cause immediate death. What was referred to as “the second phase” began at about the time Thaier Sako was seen to have been stabbed, at which time other men joined the group in the car park. This phase involved the kicking and punching and stomping on Constable Carty, at a time when he had already been stabbed and fatally injured. 
      
       
     28    In a trial that took place in 1998, both Richard and Gilbert Adam were charged with Constable Carty’s murder. Gilbert Adam was convicted of that offence; Richard Adam was acquitted of murder and of manslaughter, but found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. An appeal to this court by Richard Adam was successful and the conviction set aside: R v Richard Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; 106 A Crim R 510. An appeal by Gilbert Adam against his conviction was dismissed: R v Gilbert Adam [1999] NSWCCA 197; 47 NSWLR 267. He was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court. The appeal was heard and judgment reserved on 3 April 2001. At the time of writing judgment remained reserved.

       Ground 2 (Esho); Ground 1 (Sako): unreasonable conduct 
        
        
       
     31    It is convenient to deal first with the ground of appeal, asserted by both appellants, that challenges the reasonableness of the verdicts of guilty under s 35. In each case, the submissions advanced are the same: essentially, the argument was that, the jury having not been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the primary charge, it could not reasonably have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the alternative. 
      
       
     32    S 33 is relevantly in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whosoever  
         
        
        
         
         maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, … 
          
         with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, … 
          
         shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty-five years. “ 
         
        
       
     33    S 35, the statutory alternative, is relevantly in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whosoever maliciously by any means: 
          
         (a) …;  
          
         (b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person,  
          
         shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years.” 
         
        
       
     34    The sole distinction between the two offences is the presence (in s 33) and the absence (in s 35) of the element of intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  
      
       
     35    One complicating factor, in considering the way in which the argument was put, is that the Crown case against the appellants invoked the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise. It will be necessary to consider this circumstance below. The force of the argument can best be assessed by the examination of two categories of evidence. The first category is the evidence of eye witnesses to the attack on Constable Carty. The attack itself, including both phases, occupied a very short time and was over in a few minutes. The second relevant category of evidence is medical evidence detailing the injuries Constable Carty sustained. 
      
       
     36    In relation to the charges under s 33 the Crown presented its case on two alternative bases. Firstly, it asserted that each appellant, by his own acts, committed the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. Alternatively, it asserted that each appellant participated with others in an attack upon Constable Carty, and was liable for the injuries he suffered in accordance with the principles of joint criminal enterprise. 
      
       
     37    In order to succeed on the primary basis, it was necessary for the Crown to establish, inter alia, that the appellants (or either of them) had the necessary intent. In order to succeed on the alternative basis, it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellants were (or either of them was) present at the scene with the person or persons who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime; were (or was) there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person or those persons; and that the acts of the other participants constituting the crime were within the contemplation of the appellants, or within the scope of the agreement: see Osland v R [1998] HCA 75; 197 CLR 316, per McHugh J at [72].  
      
       
     38    The further alternative, expressly provided for by s 34 of the Crimes Act, was the s 35 offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, but without the element of express intent. It was, in fact, on this alternative that both appellants were convicted. It is a perceived anomaly in these verdicts, when regard is had to the evidence adduced, that gives rise to the principal ground of appeal. The argument advanced on behalf of the appellants was that, in the light of the evidence to which I have referred, a jury could not reasonably have accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants were guilty, in either of the postulated ways, (ie as principals or accessories) of the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm without that infliction being accompanied by the necessary intention or contemplation. In other words, rejection of the Crown case on the issue of specific intent carried the necessary corollary of rejection of the Crown case as to the physical acts attributable to the appellants. 
      
       
     39    Put shortly, the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants was that, having regard to the evidence adduced on behalf of the Crown, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of all elements except that of the relevant intention. That is because, once the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants were responsible for the physical acts that constituted the offence (under s 35), those acts could not be seen as having been done other than with an intention to do grievous bodily harm. The guilty verdicts must, on this argument, have been irrational. 
      
       
     40    The argument was, in effect a variation, or an adaptation of the reasoning of the High court in R v Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439; that, if the jury had a reasonable doubt about the intention of the appellants (and it obviously did) then that doubt must (or ought) to have extended, or been translated, to the evidence of the physical acts attributed by the Crown to the appellants. 
      
       
     41    In support of their argument, the appellants referred to the manner in which the Crown was said to have argued its case, describing this as “almost apologetic”. Counsel for the appellants relied upon a passage in the summing-up in which his Honour referred to the argument of the Crown put in support of the alternative charge in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown put its case in respect of the alternative as follows: 
         
        
        
         
          ‘Somebody might think “well we will hurt him a bit” but he is actually caused grievous bodily harm. Then that person, if you were really satisfied he wanted to hurt him but not to hurt him really seriously, would be guilty of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.’ 
         
        
        
         
         And the Crown submitted to you that it can be reached by either of the two alternative routes: 
         
        
        
         
          ‘Either you do it yourself or, alternatively, you were there as part of an agreement to do it, ready to assist, encourage and the like, but you were not actually kicking or throwing a punch or anything like that, but that you are ready to help if need be; one of those things.’ 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown submitted to you that the charge only has to be considered in respect of each accused if you do not convict that accused of the more serious charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, remembering that that offence which I have just mentioned, in the case of Mr Esho, is an alternative to the charge of murder. 
         
        
        
         
         The Crown submitted to you that it has, at the very least, made out the alternative of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm for the reasons advanced in its argument and it submits that in respect of each of the accused, at the very least, if you are not satisfied in the case of Mr Esho of the offence of murder, and in the case of Mr Esho that he had maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and in the case of all the four others that they were guilty of that offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, at the very least the Crown has proved the alternative of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.” 
         
        
       
     42    I detect nothing “apologetic” or “almost apologetic” in the way in which the trial judge summarised the Crown case on the s 35 alternative. It seems that the submission arises from the relative brevity of the passage in a lengthy summing-up. From that, it was submitted , it could be seen that the s 35 alternative “did not loom large in the trial proceedings”. The submission is not, in my opinion, supported by reference to the transcript of the final address of the Crown Prosecutor. Although his remarks to the jury were also succinct, they are sufficiently comprehensive and certainly not “apologetic”.  
      
       
     43    The circumstances are not dissimilar to those that arose in McKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348. There the appellant was charged with two counts of committing perjury intending to procure the acquittal of his client who was on trial for a serious offence. Alternative charges of perjury, but without the specific element of intention to procure the desired result, were left to the jury. In each case the jury acquitted on the primary charges and convicted on the alternatives. The only distinction between the primary and alternative charges was the element of intention (to procure a specific result). On appeal to this court, an argument was advanced that ran directly parallel with the argument here put on behalf of the appellants: that is, that the rejection of the Crown case on intent (inherent in the acquittal on the primary charge) necessarily entailed rejection of the Crown case on the alternative charges. In that case, that was because (so it was said) it was impossible to envisage a reason for committing the alleged perjury other than to secure an acquittal. This court rejected the argument, referring to the particular circumstances of the case and holding that: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was not inherently unreasonable for the jury to find against the appellant under [the lesser charge] but at least to give him the benefit of the doubt under [the primary charge].” ( 
         R v MacKenzie  
         (1995) 82 A Crim R 473, per Gleeson CJ Mahoney JA and Studdert J) 
         
        
       
     44    In the High Court the argument was repeated and was treated as an argument about “inconsistency”: the majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) paraphrased that as meaning “repugnant”, or “illogical”. 
      
       
     45    Their Honours set out a number of applicable principles, of which the fifth was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duties. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ‘It all depends upon the facts of the case.’” (internal references omitted) 
         
        
       
     46    It is to the mast constituted by “an affront to logic and common sense” that the appellants must attach their argument. But I am unable to accept that the verdicts in this case were an affront to logic and common sense. In McKenzie the High Court examined a variety of potential explanations for the differentiation in the verdicts which the jury returned in that case. They held that the verdicts did not come within any category that would have resulted in the entry of verdicts of acquittal. In this case, a similar exercise produces a similar result. The evidence was lengthy. The trial ran over approximately four months. A large number of witnesses gave evidence. Some of them proved either unfavourable to the Crown, or gave evidence inconsistent with previous statements they had made, resulting in the Crown being granted leave to cross-examine. On any analysis of the evidence, the events that resulted in the death of Constable Carty took place over a very short time, but were intense, extremely violent, and confused. The most rational explanation for the verdicts is that all members of the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each appellant had engaged in the conduct attributed to him, or had participated in such a way as to make him criminally liable, but, having regard to the speed and ferocity of the melee, did not find themselves satisfied that either appellant had formed the necessary specific intent, or (in relation to the joint enterprise aspect) had the necessary contemplation of intent in others to injure. 
      
       
     47    In McKenzie, the High Court considered as significant a direction given by the judge that it was open to the jury to find the appellant not guilty of the more serious charges but guilty of the less. So it is in the present case. The very fact that the alternative was left to the jury (without protest from either appellant’s legal representative), demonstrates that the alternative was, at the time of the trial, perceived as available. It is expressly made so by statute. However, no submission was made at the trial (unsurprisingly) that the statutory alternative did not represent a real alternative on the facts of the case. This was quintessentially a tactical move on the part of the appellants’ legal advisers. It would have taken a courageous counsel to urge upon the jury that only conviction on the more serious offence was rationally possible on the evidence. Further, the High Court in McKenzie referred to the directions concerning the heavy onus which lies on the Crown to prove every element in the offence charged, including, in that case, intention. So it is in the present case. The jury having been given a similar direction, it was open to it to reject the Crown case on specific intent, but accept its case on the actus reus. 
      
       
     48    Although the High Court upheld the McKenzie appeal on another ground, it rejected the ground based on asserted “inconsistency”. I would take the same course in the present case. 
      
       
     49    Senior counsel for Sako approached the same point from a different direction. In this instance he placed reliance upon the word “maliciously” as it appears in both s 33 and s 35. In order for the appellants to be convicted under either section it was necessary for the Crown to prove that they acted maliciously.  
      
       
     50    In s 5 of the Crimes Act 1900 “maliciously” is defined as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.” 
         
        
       
     51    Senior counsel cited R v Smith [1982] 1 NSWLR 1 and R v Safwan (1986) 8 NSWLR 97 as authority for the proposition that, in the case of an offence under s 33, the requirement of malice “adds nothing and is effectively superfluous”. I do not accept that these cases stand as authority for that proposition. Smith  involved a charge of maliciously attempting to discharge a loaded firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm, a charge which also falls within s 33 of the Crimes Act. This court (Street CJ, Reynolds JA and Maxwell J) rejected an argument that directions given to the jury on the ingredient of “maliciously”, together with directions on the requisite specific intent, were confusing. The court declined to follow English authority (R v Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421; (1967) 51 Cr App R 402) because of differences in the statutory terminology under consideration. Later, in Safwan, Street CJ rejected a further proposition to similar effect but noted that there may be some overlap between directions on intent and those on “maliciously”. In such cases, his Honour considered, there was no reason why a brief direction to that effect should not be given. He did not, however, describe the requirement of malice as “superfluous”, and nor did he conclude that no direction on the meaning of “maliciously” should be given.  
      
       
     52    However, the argument proceeded. Senior counsel asserted that, on an analysis of the jury verdict of acquittal on the s 33 charge, it could only be concluded that, either the jury were not satisfied that the appellant did the acts charged against him; or, if they were satisfied that he did those acts, they were not satisfied that he did so with the necessary intent. If the former, then obviously he could not be convicted under s 35; if the latter, the jury could not properly have been satisfied of the element of “maliciously”. 
      
       
     53    As I perceive this argument, it depends upon a false premise. The false premise is that “maliciously” precisely equates with “with intent to cause grievous bodily harm”. A cursory reading of s 5 disposes of the false premise, and the argument based upon it. In order to prove malice it is sufficient for the Crown to prove indifference to human life or suffering, or intent to injure (which might fall short of grievous bodily harm), or recklessness or wantonness. I would reject these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2A (Esho); Ground 1A (Sako): Directions on s 35 alternative 
        
       
     54    Associated with the ground of appeal just considered, and added during the course of the appeal, was the ground numbered 2A in Esho’s grounds and 1A in Sako’s grounds. The ground is framed in each case in identical terms and challenges the directions given by the trial judge on the elements of the s 35 alternative. 
      
       
     55    While the elements of “maliciously” and “with intent to cause grievous bodily harm” are not co-extensive, it is, in my opinion, correct to say that proof of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm necessarily encompasses proof of malice. The reverse is not the case. Proof of malice, within s 5, is not necessarily proof of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Thus, had the appellants been convicted under s 33, the adequacy of the directions on malice would be immaterial. 
      
       
     56    However, the appellants having been acquitted on the charge that required proof of specific intent, the element of malice acquired real significance in relation to the alternative charge. There is no point in the extensive summing-up in which any of the alternatives contained in s 5 were explained to the jury.  
      
       
     57    Criticism has been made of the statutory formulation: see, eg, R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 476. The definition is in part circular: see R v Mraz (1955) 93 CLR 493. An adequate direction to the jury on the meaning of “maliciously” may be complex. 
      
       
     58    The only reference in the summing-up to the meaning of the word “maliciously” appeared when the trial judge set out the first alternative way in which the Crown sought to prove the primary charge (s 33). His Honour told the jury that it was necessary for the Crown to prove three elements, the second of which he identified in this way: 
      
       
        
         
         “That the accused did so maliciously, ‘maliciously’ here meaning, in the circumstances of this case, that he intended, notwithstanding the effects of alcohol upon him, to cause some physical harm to David Carty, and he had no lawful cause or excuse for doing so.” 
         
        
       
     59    The trial judge gave the jury written directions setting out the elements of each of the offences charged against each of the accused. Under the heading “Alternative I” (the s 33 count) the written directions set out the three essential elements in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) that the accused inflicted grievous bodily harm on David Carty; 
         
        
        
         
         (2) that the accused did so maliciously; and 
         
        
        
         
         (3) that the accused did so with the intent of causing David Carty grievous bodily harm.” 
         
        
       
     60    Under the heading “Alternative II” (this referred to accessorial liability), seven elements were identified, including: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) that one or more persons inflicted grievous bodily harm on David Carty; 
         
        
        
         
         (2) that that person or those persons did so maliciously:” 
         
        
       
     61    He took a similar approach in relation to the statutory alternative (the s 35 count). “Alternative I” specified two essential elements, in the same terms as previously stated; and under the heading “ Alternative II ”five elements were set out, again these being in the same terms as the first two elements of alternative II under the primary count.  
      
       
     62    No explanation of the word “maliciously” appears in the written directions. Nor was any explanation of that component of the s 35 case put to the jury when the relatively brief explanation of that alternative was given. 
      
       
     63    Whether this direction was inadequate can be measured only by reference to what was alleged against each of the appellants. Here it is necessary to remember that, in relation to each appellant, the Crown put its case in two alternative ways, the first being that each appellant himself inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Constable Carty, the second being that each joined (expressly or by implication) an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement with another or others to assault Constable Carty and, knowing that Constable Carty was being or was to be assaulted, assisted or encouraged that other person or those other persons, either by his own actions or words or by displaying a readiness to give aid if required, and intending to provide that assistance or encouragement or to display that readiness to give aid if required. (The terminology in the last sentence is drawn directly from the third, fourth and fifth elements set out in the written directions given to the jury.) 
      
       
     64    There is no way of knowing whether the jury convicted either appellant of having directly inflicted grievous bodily harm, or did so by the application of the principles of accessorial liability. 
      
       
     65    If it be assumed that each (or either) appellant was convicted because the jury found that he directly inflicted blows upon Constable Carty, then the absence of a more comprehensive direction on malice could hardly be said to have cost him the chance of an acquittal. If the jury found either appellant guilty of the conduct that caused grievous bodily harm to Constable Carty, then it must have followed that those injuries were caused maliciously, within the s 5 definition. No question of, for example, accident, negating malice, was litigated. Indeed, it may be said that the appellant’s earlier argument, put as inconsistency, can be turned upon them. Once it was accepted by the jury that either appellant engaged in the kind of attack that was described, at least one of the alternatives set out in the definition of “maliciously” must have been proved. Accordingly, a more comprehensive direction could not have brought about a more favourable result.  
      
       
     66    It is necessary then to consider whether the same result emerges from a conviction based upon accessorial liability. Again, once consideration is given to the nature of the attack upon Constable Carty, a detailed explanation of the concept of malice could not have altered the result. If either appellant was guilty by reason of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise, a rational jury could not have concluded other than that the injuries were inflicted maliciously. A more expansive direction would not, in my opinion, have altered the result in either case. 
      
       
     67    Accordingly, while, for myself, I would have considered that a specific direction on the concept of malice was called for, I perceive no miscarriage of justice as a result of its absence. 
      
       
     68    I would reject these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     69    The remaining grounds of appeal are raised in relation to one or other of the appellants but not both.  
      
       
        
       ESHO 
        
        
       Ground 1: cross-examination of Bakos 
        
       
     70    In his ground numbered 1, Esho complains of the grant of leave to the Crown to cross-examine Bakos.  
      
       
     71    S38(1) of the Evidence Act provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:  
          
          
         (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or  
          
         (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or  
          
         (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement 
          
         
        
       
     72    By s 38(6) the matters the court is required to take into account in considering an application for leave to cross-examine include: 
      
       
        
       (a) whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave; and 
        
        
       (b) the matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party. 
        
       
     73    Further, s 192(2) requires the court in considering the grant of leave, to take into account, in addition to any other relevant matters: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) the extent to which granting the leave sought would be likely to add unduly to or to shorten the length of the hearing; and 
          
          
         (b) the extent to which [to grant leave] would be unfair to a party or to a witness; and 
          
          
         (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave is sought; and 
          
          
         (d) the nature of the proceeding; and  
          
          
         (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or make another order or give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
     74    What happened in this case, as far as I can discern from the transcript, is the following. Bakos was called on 6 June 2000, the fourteenth day of the trial. He gave evidence-in-chief, the transcript of which covers about eight and a half pages. Included in the evidence he gave to this point was evidence that, at the Cambridge Tavern, at a point earlier than the altercation in the car park, he had seen Gilbert Adam jump over the bar. A pocket knife fell to the ground, which Adam quickly retrieved and replaced in his pocket. 
      
       
     75    Notwithstanding this evidence, the answers Bakos gave to the Crown Prosecutor’s questions were heavily peppered with “I don’t know” and “I don’t remember”. 
      
       
     76    Plainly, the Crown had anticipated this kind of response, because it had given notice of its intention to seek leave under s 38 to question Bakos as though cross-examining him. As a result, no objection was taken on the ground of inadequate notice, and no ground of appeal so based is taken. The challenge to the grant of leave is directed to the manner in which the discretion was exercised. It is therefore necessary to examine more closely the events that preceded the application. 
      
       
     77    The Crown Prosecutor told the judge that he had an application to make in the absence of the jury, and the jury retired. In Bakos’ absence, the following exchange took place: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour: Unfavourable, inconsistent. Both or either? 
         
        
        
         
         Crown Prosecutor: Both, and claiming not to remember.  
         
        
        
         
         His Honour: Interspersed with claiming not to remember. I have had the opportunity of seeing and hearing him. Anyone going to oppose the s 38 application?” 
         
        
       
     78    Counsel for Esho did object. He articulated his objection in the following way: 
      
       
        
         
         “I oppose it, I have this difficulty with it. In the ordinary course of events an accused person knows and is entitled to know the evidence that is going to be led … I think it is fair to say that the Crown, having conferred with this witness this morning was, if not beforehand, certainly this morning, well on notice of this witness’s likely behaviour. But the difficulty that I have is this: I am aware of this witness having given some account of what he saw and heard on seven or eight occasions, including the Adam trial where he gave evidence over a period of four days, the committal was two days, he has been interviewed by way of ERISP on three separate occasions. … 
         
        
        
         
         This witness has given so many different accounts, inconsistent in so many areas. He has denied the accuracy of the transcription of several of the ERISPs.” 
         
        
       
     79    His Honour then asked if, in considering the exercise of his discretion, he was entitled to take into account his observations of the witness and was told (by counsel for Esho) that he was not only entitled, but bound, to do so. His Honour said that he had taken that into account and indicated that he was not favourably disposed towards the objection. Counsel said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am not suggesting your Honour would find other than that he is unfavourable.” 
         
        
       
     80    His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That is all I have to do at this moment in time for the purpose of granting leave to the Crown to cross-examine. That is all I have to do at this moment in history, and there is no other basis for excluding it Mr Pullinger.” 
         
        
       
     81    Counsel repeated that his difficulty was in knowing what evidence the Crown proposed to lead from Bakos: 
      
       
        
         
         “Which one or which significant part of any one of the six or seven various varieties is the Crown going to randomly select?” 
         
        
       
     82    The judge then invited the Crown Prosecutor to clarify that position. The Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “This witness has, on every occasion, nominated my friend’s client, the accused Edward Esho, as one of three men who were attacking David Carty, that he saw attacking David Carty over near the utility where he was. There may have been differences in degree, but on each occasion he said that and that this happened before he saw Thaier Sako come back. So that, in itself, the evidence he has given here about ‘that is the first thing he saw’, satisfies …” 
         
        
       
     83    His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I can tell you this, I mean the number of ‘don’t remembers’ and the number of ‘don’t knows’, it is just quite - I won’t say unbelievable - but it certainly is an impressive number and I must say I have been watching and listening to him and telling him to speak up. As far as I am concerned I propose, Mr Pullinger to grant the leave. Do you want reasons or not?” 
         
        
       
     84    Counsel responded by asking the Crown Prosecutor to identify the evidence he proposed to adduce from Bakos. When invited to respond, the Crown Prosecutor said that he could not do that and he submitted that he was not obliged to. He was asked by the judge to “lay it out in broad parameters” and replied: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will be basically putting to the witness that he saw Edward Esho, Gilbert Adam and Thaier Sako in an argument with Constable David Carty, who he didn’t know at the time, over near the utility of David Carty. He saw initially some pushing between Thaier Sako and Carty. He then saw Esho and Adam punching at Carty and Carty defending himself, and then he saw, ultimately, Thaier Sako.” 
         
        
       
     85    No voir dire was sought or conducted. While reference was made by counsel to a number of different accounts of the relevant events said to have been given by Bakos, no statement, record of interview, or transcript of evidence was tendered to establish the asserted inconsistency in his accounts. Whether his Honour had knowledge otherwise of these alleged accounts does not appear; so far as the transcript reveals, his Honour was asked to accept, on a statement by counsel from the Bar table, that such inconsistencies existed. However, the Crown Prosecutor did not dispute the assertions made by Esho’s counsel. 
      
       
     86    His Honour granted the leave sought by the Crown Prosecutor. At a later point he formally, but succinctly, gave reasons for that decision, the substance of which was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Í am satisfied in the circumstances of this case that leave should be granted, both in terms of s 38 (1)(a) and/or in terms of s 38(1)(c). I think those reasons are sufficient enough for me to indicate that I propose to grant the leave sought.” 
         
        
       
     87    As will be seen no mention was made, either by counsel in argument, or by his Honour, of the provisions of s 192(2). As appears from the passage extracted from the debate, his Honour seems to have been of the view that the only issue was whether the witness was shown to be unfavourable, and that that having been established, there was “no other basis for excluding it”.  
      
       
     88    This was plainly not the case. In Stanoevski [2001] HCA 4; 75 ALJR 454, the High Court had under consideration a case in which leave had been granted to cross-examine an accused person pursuant to s 112 of the Evidence Act.  Like s 38, s 112 confers a discretion on a trial judge to grant the leave sought, and, also like s 38, the s 112 discretion is to be exercised after taking into account the matters mentioned in s 192(2). The majority (Gaudron, Kirby and Callinan JJ) wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “S 192 applies to this case, and in particular to the exercise by the trial judge of his or her discretion under s 112 of the Act. it should be noted that the leave required under s 112 is not leave to adduce evidence, but to cross-examine about the character of a defendant. In addition to matters which may be relevant in a particular case, in all cases the court must take into account the matters prescribed by s 192(2). It is clear here that the trial judge (probably because his attention does not seem to have been drawn to it) did not take into account all of those matters, some of which would inevitably been relevant to the way in which his discretion ought to be exercised had he adverted to them.” 
         
        
       
     89    In the particular circumstances that appertained in Stanoevski, the High Court considered that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of s 192 (2) were of importance. So far as I can ascertain, paragraphs (b) and (c) were potentially important here. Possible unfairness to Esho was flagged by his counsel in that, he submitted, he did not know on which of the various versions of events Bakos would be questioned.  
      
       
     90    The Crown referred to the decision of this court in R v Fowler [2000] NSWCCA 142; unreported, 23 May 2000, in support of the grant of leave under s 38. However, Fowler was decided before the judgments in Stanoevski were delivered and must now read in the light of that later authority. It is of some significance that, in Fowler, no mention was made of s 192(2).  
      
       
     91    There being no evidence of different accounts given by Esho, or the extent of such different accounts, it is impossible for this court, as it must have been for the trial judge, to evaluate the extent of the unfairness which it was contended would have flowed to Esho. However, as I read the judgment in Stanoevski, it is necessary for a judge asked to exercise the s 38 discretion to consider all of paragraphs of s 192(2), and their possible application to the particular circumstances of the case. This was not done, and, in my opinion, on the authority of Stanoevski, it constituted an error in the proceedings. 
      
       
     92    It thus becomes necessary to consider whether this was an error such as to result in a miscarriage of justice, or potentially to do so. The realities of the trial cannot be overlooked. Once leave had been granted the Crown Prosecutor put to Bakos, in a leading fashion, statements he was said to have previously made. Bakos continued to claim lack of memory. He was shown the transcript of an interview of 9 June 1997. Having seen that, he admitted to having told police that “Eddie” [Esho] had confronted Constable Carty, and engaged in a degree of physical violence. However, when the Crown Prosecutor put to him that that was a truthful account, he said that it was not.  
      
       
     93    The same pattern followed when he was asked questions about subsequent interviews with police. He continued to claim lack of memory or ignorance.  
      
       
     94    At one point, when being asked about the interview recorded on 9 June, Bakos asserted that others had put “words in my mouth and into my head”. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “They put shit into my head.” 
         
        
       
     95    He said he wanted nothing more to do with the affair, that he had been forced to go to the police station to give information, but said that he did not know by whom. Later again, he repeated that he wanted nothing to do with it, saying that he had his own life to get on with. He said the only part of the fracas that he saw was: 
      
       
        
         
         “When Thaier was walking back to me, when he was on the ground. That is the only thing I know. The rest was put into my head.” 
         
        
        
       He said that he had made up some parts of the account he had given.  
        
       
     96    Even without the benefit of having observed Bakos in the witness box, it is abundantly plain from the transcript that he was a witness whose evidence was unreliable. In fact, as the summing-up discloses, counsel then appearing for Esho urged the jury to accept particular aspects of one or more of the various versions he had given. It seems reasonably plain that, by the conclusion of the questioning by the Crown and the cross-examination by counsel for Esho, the salient passages in all of the various versions had been drawn out. Equally, the Crown proposed that the jury would accept certain aspects of the accounts that he had given.  
      
       
     97    On at least five occasions during the course of the summing-up the trial judge referred to Bakos’s evidence. Importantly, on the first occasion he did, he gave this caution (in this passage he was referring not only to the evidence of Bakos, but also to the evidence of Denis Oshana, in respect of whom, also, he granted leave to the Crown under s 38): 
      
       
        
         
         “You will recall, and no doubt you have it well and truly indelibly printed on your mind, that some of the evidence that has been given at the trial by both and either of these witnesses was in conflict with the contents of some of the earlier statements made by both or either of the witnesses; in conflict with what they had said in an earlier trial involving Mr Adam; and also in conflict, so it was said, with evidence given in other proceedings, including committal proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         You must decide, in the case of such conflicts, whether you accept the evidence given in the trial by either or both of these gentlemen, or what each of the witnesses said in their earlier respective statements. … 
         
        
        
         
         Nevertheless, you must decide, in the case of such conflicts, whether you accept the evidence given by each of them in the trial, or what the witness Mr Bakos, or the witness Mr Oshana, said in the earlier statements, or, on the other hand, whether, in view of the conflicts, you should even reject their evidence altogether. That is entirely a matter for you. 
         
        
        
         
         In respect of the earlier statements I must caution you and warn you that such evidence may be unreliable. I warn you that you must exercise caution in determining whether to accept the evidence or any part of the evidence of either or both of these people, and the weight that you give to such part of the evidence as you may accept. However it is open to you, having exercised the necessary degree of caution, to accept the evidence also contained in the earlier statements in preference to the evidence given by Mr Oshana or Mr Bakos at the trial. Whether you do so or do not is a matter for you. “ 
         
        
       
     98    Much later in the summing-up the judge described Bakos as “a controversial eye witness”, and again reminded the jury of the earlier caution he had given. In subsequent passages he reminded the jury in strong and detailed terms of the submissions of counsel concerning Bakos’s evidence. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that Bakos’ evidence weighed very heavily in the jury’s consideration. 
      
       
     99    The submissions advanced on behalf of Esho in support of this ground made similar points in relation to the absence of any consideration being given to ss 135, 137, 102, 103, or 60 of the Evidence Act. In my opinion, these add nothing to the argument based on s 192(2). If it appeared that Bakos’ evidence advanced the Crown case in any significant way, it would be necessary to consider whether, if the various provisions had been taken into account, a different ruling might have been made. It is unnecessary to consider whether any error has been shown in any of these other respects, because, even if such error were shown, for the reasons already given, it is unlikely that any significant weight was given to his evidence. That proposition emerges more clearly when a closer examination is made of the way in which the Crown relied upon Bakos’ evidence. . 
      
       
     100    In order to appreciate the significance of Bakos’ evidence in relation to the charges on which Esho was convicted it is necessary to appreciate the manner in which the Crown put its case. This may conveniently be done by examining the Crown opening, which was transcribed, and salient passages in the trial judge’s summing-up.  
      
       
     101    The opening, as recorded, tends to support the characterisation made by appeal counsel for Esho, that the event, although short lived, was really in two phases. The first phase involved the initial confrontation with Constable Carty, and his stabbing; an identifiable group of Assyrian men, including Esho, was, on the Crown case, involved in that phase. The second phase, which must have followed immediately, occurred after Constable Carty had fallen to the ground, but before his death. It was during that time that he was punched, kicked and stomped on. 
      
       
     102    The Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I expect that the evidence will establish that three Assyrian men approached David Carty in the parking lot, not necessarily all together, but very soon, one after the other.” 
         
        
       
     103    He identified the three men as Thaier Sako, Gilbert Adam and Esho. He went on: 
      
       
        
         
         “Very quickly, I expect the evidence will establish that a fight broke out with at least one of the Assyrian men wielding a knife. During that fight someone stabbed Thaier Sako in the neck, causing blood to come out of his neck. It will be the Crown case that that wound was not inflicted by David Carty, who was unarmed. 
         
        
        
         
         Both Gilbert Adam and the accused Edward Esho swung at David Carty. Within a short period of time David Carty fell to the ground suffering from a fatal wound to the heart. He didn’t get up again. The attack on him continued as he lay on the ground and he quickly lapsed into unconsciousness from the rapid loss of blood.” 
         
        
       
     104    The Crown Prosecutor then went on to outline the evidence he expected would be given by Oshana, relevantly in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “… he then looked over to where he had seen the fight start and he saw Constable Carty lying on the ground, shaking. Standing near him he saw some other men, Bashar Hurmiz, the accused Eddie Esho and the brothers Gilbert and Richard Adam. He heard Esho screaming ‘he killed my brother. My brother is dead’, obviously a reference to his friend Thaier Sako. He observed men walking around David Carty as he lay on the ground, kicking him very hard. … 
         
        
        
         
         He saw [Constable Auld] standing next to a car which was in front of Constable Carty and she was calling out ‘Leave him alone. Leave him alone.’ And a man appeared to be just ignoring her and continuing to kick Constable Carty on the ground. 
         
        
        
         
         He said the attack wasn’t continuous. That those men at one stage walked over to where Thaier was lying and had a look and then went back and continued attacking David Carty.” 
         
        
       
     105    At a much later point in the opening the Crown Prosecutor said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the case of Eddie Esho, we submit that he was there and you will find that he was there and was party to that stabbing.” 
         
        
       
     106    It was on that basis that Esho was charged with murder. However the Crown Prosecutor went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown will also call Dr Godian Fulde who was the doctor at Emergency Services at St Vincents. He will give evidence about the heart injury, the effect of it, and also the other injuries that occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         I stress, we will not be suggesting that those other injuries contributed in any way that would justify a charge of murder, and they are only charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
         
        
        
         
         Edward Esho is also charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, as the others are, as an alternative charge. If you weren’t satisfied that Edward Esho took part in the initial attack on David Carty, but were satisfied that he joined in the attack as David Carty lay on the ground, then that may be a basis upon which you could find him guilty of that offence, if you are satisfied of the essential elements otherwise.” 
         
        
       
     107    A little later, again referring to the s 33 count, the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that it was the Crown case that the act [causing grievous bodily harm] occurred while Constable Carty was still alive.  
      
       
     108    The Crown Prosecutor referred briefly to the charge of affray, with which each of the five accused was charged, but did not clearly specify at which point in the events the Crown asserted that this offence occurred.  
      
       
     109    In my opinion the last passage extracted shows clearly that the case the Crown intended to, and did, present was that, firstly Esho was guilty of murder by reason of his involvement in the first phase of the events - that is, the occasion when the knife was produced and Constable Carty was stabbed. The alternative charge, the s 33 charge, did not relate to those specific events, and was not presented as an alternative based upon the absence of a sufficient intent, or some other matter on which the Crown evidence failed to reach the requisite standard, but was, in reality, based upon the allegations of punching, kicking and stomping, that occurred after the stabbing, after Constable Carty had fallen to the ground, but before he died. It was in relation to “the other injuries” that this offence was said to have been committed. In these circumstances it may not have been strictly necessary for the Crown to frame the count as an alternative, but that is the course it took. 
      
       
     110    This position was taken up by the trial judge in directing the jury on the s 33 count. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “The Crown submits, in respect of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, that whilst there is abundant evidence, so it asserts, for you to convict of murder, if you are not satisfied that Eddie Esho took part in the original fight that led to the stabbing but did not have sufficient intention or involvement to be held guilty of murder, then you would look at the alternative charge against him of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  
         
        
        
         
         The Crown submits that the indictment states as it does, that Mr Esho is charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm as an alternative which has been laid, were you not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Esho was involved in the attack on David Carty at the time the fatal stab was inflicted. It is an alternative that comes in where you are not so satisfied, but the Crown submits that it comes in and applies in a situation where it claims that Mr Carty was alive, in a situation subsequent to the stabbing but preceding the onset of death from the stabbing.” 
         
        
       
     111    I have set out these extracts at some length because it is necessary to analyse the issues to which the evidence elicited from Bakos, following the grant of s 38 leave, went. Given the fashion in which his evidence was adduced, this is not an easy task. What the Crown did was to put to him passages from the various statements or interviews he had made or given. His evidence was, as I have indicated, difficult to follow. However, to the extent that it described any activity by Esho, it was activity that must have taken place before Constable Carty fell to the ground. That is because he had described Esho as swinging punches at Constable Carty. I have discovered no references in any of the passages of his previous statements or information put to Esho that relate to events which took place after Constable Carty’s collapse. The significance of that is that whatever emerged from Esho’s cross-examination by the Crown, it went only to the charge of murder, on which he was acquitted. 
      
       
     112    This is the most significant point made by the Crown in opposition to this ground. Bakos was described as “the vital witness” in the Crown case against Esho - but in relation to the charge of murder, on which Esho was acquitted. That circumstance illustrates, more forcefully than anything else, the absence of weight that was attached by the jury to his evidence. Bakos’ descriptions of the events were primarily, if not entirely, directed to the first phase of the events in question; that is, the events which resulted in the death of Constable Carty, and preceded the second phase which was of particular relevance to the charge of affray and the charge of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. His descriptions, various as they were, did not go to the events that led to the convictions under s 35, or of affray. In those circumstances it is difficult to see how the grant of leave to cross-examine Bakos in any way caused a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     113    Further, I am satisfied that, even if the trial judge had expressly adverted to s 192(2) the decision would have been no different. Although it was urged upon this court that the leave granted significantly protracted the trial, (involving s 192(2)(a) by reason of the length of time spent in the cross-examination of Bakos) whether or not error has been demonstrated in the grant of leave cannot be determined with the benefit of hindsight. It is to be observed, in any event, that the question is not whether the grant of leave would be likely to prolong the trial - it is whether the grant of leave would be likely to add unduly to the length of the trial. That assessment can only be made in the light of other factors referred to in s 192 (2) such as the importance of the evidence and the nature of the proceedings. Bakos’ evidence was regarded as important in the Crown case on murder. That it was not, in the end, sufficient to result in a conviction on that charge does not affect the process that had to be undertaken by the trial judge in determining the application. That question also had to be determined prospectively, not retrospectively.  
      
       
     114    I would, accordingly, reject the ground of appeal based upon the grant of leave to the Crown to question Bakos as though cross-examining. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3: the verdict of the jury is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
        
       
     115    In written submissions in support of this ground counsel for Esho asserted, that in relation to the counts on which Esho was convicted, the Crown case relied upon the evidence of Tony Bakos and Denis Oshana. For reasons I have sought to explain above, I am satisfied that the evidence of Bakos did not, at least in any significant way, go to any charge other than the charge of murder. 
      
       
     116    Oshana fell into the same category as Bakos in the sense that leave was granted to the Crown under s 38 to question him as though cross-examining. No ground of appeal complains of that grant of leave. 
      
       
     117    A reading of the transcript reveals that Oshana’s initial evidence was not as unfavourable to the Crown as was that of Bakos; or, put another way, Oshana was less intransigent than the transcript shows Bakos to have been. Prior to the grant of s 38 leave, and when Oshana was being questioned by the Crown in the ordinary way, he described seeing Constable Carty lying on the ground surrounded by a number of others who included Esho. He said Esho was a couple of metres away from Constable Carty, but moving around. Asked if he saw movement of anybody’s feet around Constable Carty he said he had seen “jumping around kind of thing”. He said it was “probably” kicking, and that four men he had named, including Esho, were “probably” close to Constable Carty at the time of the kicking. He heard Esho call out: 
      
       
        
         
         “My brother’s got stabbed … he stabbed my brother, my brother got stabbed.” 
         
        
       
     118    He heard this called out a couple of times in a loud voice.  
      
       
     119    This evidence alone, given before Oshana was cross-examined by the Crown, was significant evidence in the Crown case against Esho on the alternative charge. 
      
       
     120    After the grant of leave to cross-examine, previous statements made, or evidence given, by Oshana were put to him, and this, effectively, reinforced his earlier evidence. On one occasion he had said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I could see people were kicking the policeman, but I can’t tell you which one of these people were kicking the policeman. There was legs going everywhere and they were moving around the policeman.” 
         
        
        
       He had identified Esho as one of four people (the other three of whom he also identified) who were standing near Constable Carty. He said: 
        
        
         
         “Í remember that Eddie [Esho] was screaming and swearing at the policemen and he’d looked like he lost it.” 
         
        
        
       He had described a number of men, including Esho, “kicking the policeman”. 
        
       
     121    He agreed that, in the committal proceedings, he had also described seeing Constable Carty being kicked, and when asked who was nearby at the time, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It would have been Eddie.” 
         
        
       
     122    This was the principal evidence directly implicating Esho in the act that constituted the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, and also the offence of affray. There was some supporting evidence, including evidence of the altercation between Esho and Constable Carty much earlier in the evening in Fairfield; evidence of Constable Carty’s blood on Esho’s sock and shoe and on his shirt; and evidence of lies told by Esho on which the Crown relied as indicating a consciousness of guilt on his part. No criticism is made of the admission of any of this evidence, or the manner in which the jury was directed in relation thereto. Nor is any criticism made of the cautionary directions given by the trial judge about Oshana’s reliability, much of which has been extracted above. 
      
       
     123    Esho gave evidence in the trial, and the content of his evidence is relied upon in support of this ground. However, as is always the case, the issue of the acceptance of evidence is peculiarly one for the jury. The jury was not obliged either to accept Esho’s evidence, or even to regard it as a reasonably possible version of events. Having been correctly instructed in relation to these matters, the jury plainly rejected Esho’s account. In my opinion the evidence outlined above was sufficient, if accepted by the jury, to sustain the findings of guilt. It was therefore open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Esho’s guilt on the two offences on which it convicted. M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
      
       
     124    I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     125    That concludes the grounds of appeal against conviction raised by Esho. 
      
       
        
       SAKO 
        
        
       Ground 2: admission of evidence of interview 
        
        
       
     126    By this ground Sako asserts error in the admission into evidence of certain questions and answers contained in two electronically recorded interviews conducted with him on 18 April 1997, the first at the police station, and the second at the Cambridge Tavern, at and around the scene of Constable Carty’s death.  
      
       
     127    The objection in each case was taken under s 85 of the Evidence Act, which provides: 
      
       
        
       85. Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants 
         
        
        
         
         (1) 
          This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and only to evidence of an admission made by a defendant:  
          
          
         (a) in the course of official questioning, or  
          
         (b) as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing the decision whether a prosecution of the defendant should be brought or should be continued.  
         
        
        
         
         (2) 
          Evidence of the admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.  
         
        
        
         
         (3) 
          Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (2), it is to take into account:  
          
          
         (a) any relevant condition or characteristic of the person who made the admission, including age, personality and education and any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the person is or appears to be subject, and  
          
         (b) if the admission was made in response to questioning:  
          
           
           (i) the nature of the questions and the manner in which they were put, and  
            
           (ii) the nature of any threat, promise or other inducement made to the person questioned.  
           
          
         
        
       
     128    In the first series of questions to which objection was taken Sako told the interviewing officer that he had not been in the street, or near Constable Carty’s motor vehicle. In the second series of questions he denied having approached Constable Carty after he was stabbed, and in the last series, he denied any knowledge of Constable Carty. In the subsequent interview the answers to which objection was taken were of similar content.  
      
       
     129    The Crown relied upon the overall content of these answers as representing lies told by Sako signifying a consciousness of his guilt: R v Zoneff [2000] HCA 28; 112 A Crim R 114; R v Edwards (1999) 178 CLR 193; 68 A Crim R 349. By other evidence the Crown proposed to establish that these answers were untrue. It is only by reason of the extended definition of “admission” contained in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act that permits these answers to be so characterised, with the result that s 85 is applicable. The basis for Sako’s objection to the admission of the evidence was his claimed lack of proficiency in the English language; that is, he put forward his claimed lack of proficiency as a “relevant condition or characteristic” by reason of which he urged the court not to find that the circumstances in which the admission were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected.  
      
       
     130    When that question arose Sako himself gave evidence on the voir dire. An Assyrian interpreter was sworn to interpret for him, but was directed, at the outset of his evidence, not to translate unless expressly asked. The transcript shows that Sako gave the whole of his evidence, which proceeded over twenty-one pages of transcript, without recourse to the interpreter. The police officer who interviewed him also gave evidence on the voir dire. He said, inter alia, that he had appreciated that English was not Sako’s first language and had, at the outset of the interview, asked if he would like an interpreter. Sako replied that he understood. It is interesting to observe that, at the conclusion of the police officer’s evidence on the voir dire, the video recording was tendered as an exhibit, but that counsel then appearing for Sako did not ask for it to be viewed by the trial judge. Notwithstanding that, in a judgment delivered on the day the matter was debated, his Honour observed that he had had the opportunity of viewing and considering the recording. The trial judge rejected Sako’s claim that his grasp of English was in any way inadequate. He therefore declined to disallow the answers under consideration by reference to the provisions of that section. He considered also the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 135, and the evaluation process required by s 137, but concluded that neither of these should be exercised in favour of exclusion of the evidence. Finally, he considered the provisions of s 90 of the Evidence Act, which confers on a criminal court the discretion to refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or to prove a particular fact if, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to admit the evidence. For the reasons already given, he declined also to exercise that power in favour of Sako. The arguments advanced in this court in support of the ground were essentially a rehearsal of the arguments extensively put to the trial judge, and comprehensively and thoroughly considered - and rejected - by him. In my opinion the fundamental finding of fact on which his Honour’s decision was made, that is, that Sako’s grasp of English was not as compromised as he contended, is fatal to the argument in this court. From that, it can be inferred that, whatever the reason for Sako’s false replies, they were not brought about by lack of comprehension of the questions, and were therefore not such as to affect the truth of the “admissions” made. These findings of fact were not challenged. 
      
       
     131    It was further argued that s 137 ought to have been applied in favour of rejecting the evidence, because, so the argument went, Sako’s language difficulties meant that the evidence had relatively slight probative value, but was nevertheless likely to be given disproportionate weight by the jury. There being no complaint about the Zoneff and Edwards directions given by the judge I would reject that argument also. 
      
       
     132    In my opinion there is no substance to this ground of appeal.  
      
       
        
       Ground 3 - Identification directions 
        
       
     133    The last ground of appeal argued on behalf of Sako in relation to the conviction concerned directions given in relation to his identification. Three witnesses as to identification were nominated. The only elucidation of this ground of appeal was that the directions given failed to meet the standard required by the decision of the High Court in Domican v R (1990) 173 CLR 555: that is, they lacked sufficient strength. A reading of the summing up shows that this submission is without foundation. At an early stage, his Honour reminded the jury, in relation to various matters, that the events in question had taken place over a short time in the early hours of the morning, when witnesses may have had little real opportunity to make clear observations. He reminded the jury that no two eye witnesses had given identical accounts; that some lay witnesses had been to some extent under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and some had, by reason of obstructions, only limited opportunity to observe events. He then turned directly to the question of identification and told the jury that such evidence has always to be “approached with special caution” before being accepted as reliable. He then proceeded, in classic terms, to point out why that is so. 
      
       
     134    Later in the summing-up, his Honour reviewed extensively the arguments put by counsel, not only for Sako, but for the other co-accused, on specific matters concerning identification. 
      
       
     135    In my opinion the jury could have been left in no doubt that it was necessary for them to approach the identification evidence with care and even scepticism. There is little, if anything, that the judge could have added, and indeed, there is no specific direction or instruction which is contended ought to have been, but was not, given. 
      
       
     136    I would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     137    My conclusion is, accordingly, that both conviction appeals should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       The applications for leave to appeal against sentence 
        
       
     138    Both Esho and Sako seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon them.  
      
       
     139    The statutory maximum applicable to an offence against s 35 is imprisonment for seven years. A conviction for affray carries a statutory maximum of imprisonment for five years. On the conviction for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm Esho was sentenced to imprisonment for six years and eight months, with a non parole period of five years. On the charge of affray he was sentenced to a concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for two years. 
      
       
     140    Sako, who was convicted only of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, was sentenced to imprisonment for five years with a non parole period of three years and nine months. 
      
       
     141    The remarks on sentence were extensive, comprehensive and detailed. Abadee J considered all of the circumstances of the offence, and the individual roles played by, and the personal circumstance of, each appellant. As to the events of the early morning of 18 April 1997, affecting both appellants, he held that Constable Carty was unarmed and had offered no provocation. He recounted the evidence that the attack had taken place in two phases, the first culminating in the stabbing of Constable Carty, the second constituted by what he described, on more than one occasion, as “ferocious”, “brutal”, and “savage” behaviour. He characterised the injuries suffered by Constable Carty in the second phase as “horrendous” and “brutal”. 
      
       
     142    He considered the evidence and concluded that, for sentencing purposes, the appellants should be regarded as guilty as accessories, rather than as directly responsible for any of the injuries, but he took the view that this did not reduce the culpability of either appellant. He specifically reminded himself that each was to be sentenced for the s 35 offence, omitting any element of intention to cause grievous bodily harm, and he also specifically reminded himself of the principle stated in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, that he could not take into account any aggravating feature that would have elevated the offence or offences for which the appellants were convicted to a more serious offence, carrying a more severe maximum penalty. He concluded, however, that he was entitled to, and he did, take into account three aggravating features: firstly, that a knife or knives had, to the knowledge of each appellant, been used during the first phase of the attack (although he did not conclude that either appellant knew at the time of the second phase that Constable Carty had been fatally injured); secondly, that at the time of the second phase, Constable Carty was, to the knowledge of the appellants, defenceless; and thirdly, that each appellant knew that Constable Carty was a police officer. 
      
       
     143    An argument had been put on behalf of both appellants to the effect that parity considerations were material. This arose in a somewhat unusual way. As has been previously noted, in an earlier trial, Richard Adam had been convicted of the same offence. Wood CJ at CL sentenced him to penal servitude for two years and eight months made up of a minimum term of two years and an additional term of eight months. He had, it seems from the judgment of this court on the conviction appeal, spent only two days in pre-trial custody following his arrest. On this basis the appellants argued that they could legitimately expect a sentence of a similar term. Abadee J rejected that argument. A Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on Richard Adam had been filed, but, by reason of the success of conviction appeal, the court did not proceed to deal with the Crown appeal against sentence. It will be necessary to say more about this when dealing with the specific matters raised on behalf of each of the appellants.  
      
       
     144    It is necessary now to consider the findings of fact made by Abadee J in relation to each of the appellants individually.  
      
       
        
       ESHO 
        
       
     145    Abadee J found as a fact that Esho was present at the commencement of the encounter between Thaier Sako and Constable Carty; but that, after Thaier Sako was injured, Esho and Thaier Sako withdrew from the scene and that Esho was not present at the time Constable Carty was stabbed. However, he also found that Esho, shortly after, returned to the scene, intending to harm Constable Carty, and that he expressly incited and encouraged others to continue the “ferocious and brutal “ attack. Significantly, his Honour held (and said so more than once) that Esho played “a significant role” in the commencement of the altercation, and was “in it from the start”. 
      
       
     146    His Honour believed that Esho was resentful towards Constable Carty because of the earlier incident when Constable Carty had reprimanded him in the Fairfield Mall for his use of bad language. 
      
       
     147    Abadee J concluded that Esho’s s 35 offence fell into the category of “worst case” justifying the imposition of the maximum penalty provided by the statute.  
      
       
     148    His Honour reviewed the subjective material that had been placed before him. This showed that Esho was born in Iraq on 14 March 1972 and was almost twenty-five at the time of the offence. He had served in the Iraqi army which he deserted before migrating to Australia. He had some criminal history, being 1996 convictions for violent disorder and malicious damage. There was evidence from members of Esho’s family attesting to his involvement in the Assyrian church, and of his devotion to his family. His Honour was unimpressed with this evidence, remarking that the compassion that was been said to be part of Esho’s character was not in evidence at the time of the assault on Constable Carty. He also rejected a suggestion, made by Esho’s uncle, that Esho had been threatened since Constable Carty’s death. He held that Esho had shown no contrition or remorse. The subjective circumstances recounted did not alter his Honour’s view that Esho’s offence fell into the worst class of case. 
      
       
     149    Abadee J took a slightly more benign view of Sako’s role in the crime. He accepted that Sako was not present at the initial confrontation between his brother and Constable Carty, and was not present when Constable Carty was stabbed. He became involved when he learned that his brother Thaier had been stabbed. His Honour found that Sako had approached Constable Carty at a time after he (Constable Carty) had been stabbed and was lying on the ground unconscious or nearly so. He found that Sako intended to inflict some harm, falling short of grievous bodily harm, on Constable Carty, and was involved as an accessory, knowing that the other participants were engaged in a “ferocious battery” on Constable Carty. He accepted that his involvement was a result of “spontaneous emotion” generated by the knowledge that his brother had been injured, but rejected as not proven to the requisite standard a proposition advanced by the Crown that he was expressly motivated by revenge. He accepted that, at the time, Sako was “very distressed and emotional”. He accepted that Sako was less culpable than Esho and therefore did not accept the proposition that his offence fell into the worst category of case, although he held that it was close to such an offence. He found that Sako knew Constable Carty was a police officer. 
      
       
     150    Sako’s personal history is not dissimilar to that of Esho. He was born, also in Iraq, on 7 April 1971 and was just a few days short of twenty-six at the time of this offence. He, too, deserted the Iraqi army and came to Australia with his family in 1992 when he was granted refugee status. Sako’s criminal record contained two offences of resisting police, one of cruelty to an animal, and one of violent disorder, all committed in 1995 or 1996. 
      
       
     151    Sako had had some employment but was in receipt of unemployment benefits at the time of the offence. 
      
       
     152    In his case, too, family members gave evidence of a non-violent disposition but this also found little favour with Abadee J. His Honour did, however, note one additional matter of significance for sentencing purposes. That was the period of time Sako had spent in pre-trial custody (two and a half years) and onerous conditions that applied after his release on bail. 
      
       
     153    Both appellants reiterated the arguments advanced before Abadee J that principles of parity required the imposition of a sentence comparable with that imposed on Richard Adam prior to his acquittal on appeal. In my opinion the principles relevant to parity of sentences have no application in this case. Those principles are not founded on a proposition that the first sentencing judge in relation to co-offenders establishes a bench mark which is to be adopted and followed by subsequent sentencing judges. They are based upon the proposition that co-offenders can, generally speaking, (but having regard to differences in relevant circumstances) expect to be dealt with commensurately. Given that Richard Adam will serve no sentence, those principles cannot be relevant. 
      
       
        
       The grounds of the application 
        
        
       ESHO 
        
       
     154    The first of the grounds upon which Esho challenges the sentences concerns the finding of fact, expressly made by his Honour, that he had played a significant role in the initiation of the altercation. He does not challenge the finding that he was present when Thaier Sako first confronted Constable Carty, or that he had asked Constable Carty “Why you tell me to shut up?” [at Fairfield]” 
      
       
     155    In one sense, the finding of fact is incontrovertible. There can be little doubt that the precipitating event was the encounter between Constable Carty and Esho earlier in the evening; nor that that event was brought up by Esho at the Cambridge tavern; nor that Esho was present with Thaier Sako when he approached Constable Carty in the car park.  
      
       
     156    The point that is made on behalf of Esho is that, while these circumstances may be accepted, it does not follow that he was responsible for the conduct of any of the other participants. As a matter of logic, that may be correct. But that requires some analysis of the extent (if any) to which Abadee J regarded Esho’s culpability as exacerbated by reason of his involvement in the precipitating events, and the extent (if any) to which that conclusion can be sustained on the evidence.  
      
       
     157    Abadee J noted that Esho had no particular or valid reason to approach Constable Carty and that, in effect, Esho had to make a detour in order to come into contact with Constable Carty.  
      
       
     158    I have given consideration to the argument, and to the findings of fact made by Abadee J. I am satisfied that the findings of fact were warranted on the evidence. In my opinion, those findings represented a circumstance, not of aggravation, but one which certainly did not mitigate Esho’s role. I am satisfied that, in saying what he said, Abadee J intended to attribute some blame to Esho for the commencement of the confrontation. But I am equally satisfied, when all of the evidence is considered, that that reasoning process was a valid one. The fact, accepted by Abadee J, that Esho had raised the earlier encounter with Constable Carty is of considerable significance. It could hardly be thought that, Esho having said that, his companions spontaneously and independently undertook the attack.  
      
       
     159    Further, although it was a circumstance that certainly did not assist Esho on sentence, Abadee J was careful, in the same context, to point out that Esho was not present at the time of the stabbing of Constable Carty and had in fact withdrawn, at that time, from the fracas. It was only later that he returned to participate further in the second phase of the attack. In my opinion no error has been shown in this respect. 
      
       
     160    The next two matters raised on behalf of Esho concerned Abadee J’s evaluation of the gravity of his conduct. The first of these challenges the finding that his conduct should be categorised as falling within the worst class of case. The second challenges the conclusion that the finding that Esho’s liability was accessorial, not direct, did not diminish his culpability. In considering the first of these matters it is necessary carefully to avoid classifying the s 35 offence as, in reality, a s 33 offence - that is, an offence committed with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The potential for De Simoni error is manifest. However, Abadee J carefully, and on more than one occasion, reminded himself that he was not sentencing for an offence that involved the element of specific intent; at the same time, he recognised that malice was an element of the offence proved. This court needs to take the same care, but, nevertheless, it is entitled to have regard to what Abadee J described as “the ferocity” of the attack that constituted the second phase. This was a circumstance in which a large number of young men surrounded Constable Carty, who had already been stabbed fatally, who was lying defenceless on the ground, and who was repeatedly kicked and stomped upon with such force as to cause the injuries earlier described. While I recognise the difficulty in approaching this question on the basis that there was no intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, I am nevertheless satisfied that the offence may properly be characterised as a worst case scenario: that is, a worst case under s 35. The sheer number of participants is a significant factor in this regard. I am satisfied that concluding that this was a worst case example of an s 35 offence does not fall foul of De Simoni principle. There must, after all, be room for a “worst case” under s 35 without crossing the boundary of s 33. In my opinion Abadee J’s finding that this was such a case was open to him and is not vulnerable to the challenge now made. 
      
       
     161    The same response must be made to the complaint that his Honour did not consider the offence mitigated because it was proved to have been committed as party to a joint enterprise as distinct from having been committed as a principal. Again, the sheer number of participants, and the sustained nature of the attack support the findings of Abadee J. So also does the express finding that Esho was aware that Constable Carty was a police officer. There is no principle of sentencing that accessorial liability necessarily involves lesser culpability. The degree of culpability of any accessory depends upon the facts of the particular case. In this case the degree of culpability was high.  
      
       
     162    Two further matters concern the approach taken by Abadee J to subjective circumstances. In one, Esho complains that his Honour failed to give any effective allowance for the possibility of rehabilitation. In the second he complains that his Honour failed to give any weight to his subjective circumstances.  
      
       
     163    His Honour did mention the evidence called on behalf of Esho as to his personal history and background, and this has been outlined above. He held that these circumstances did not affect his earlier conclusion that the offence fell into the worst class. One difficulty for Esho is that Abadee J considered that the evidence about his general disposition was in conflict with the evidence of his conduct on the morning in question. Further, so far as I can see, apart from the evidence of family members as to Esho’s past conduct, no real case on rehabilitation was advanced. The finding of the absence of contrition is a significant matter in this respect. I do not think his Honour could have been in error in not making allowances for rehabilitation, of which there was no evidence.  
      
       
     164    In the same vein, Esho complained that retribution and deterrence were emphasised at the expense of the matters previously mentioned. It is true that his Honour gave considerable weight to, in particular, general deterrence, but I am unable to see that this was an error. This was an offence that called for significant weight to be given to that aspect of sentencing. Not the least consideration, in this regard is Esho’s knowledge of Constable Carty’s position.  
      
       
     165    Finally, it was argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In sentencing Esho Abadee J took into account a period of pre-trial custody which was of the order of one and a half months. The effective sentence was therefore of six years nine months and fifteen days. For the s35 offence, against a statutory maximum of seven years, this may, at first glance, appear difficult to justify. However, regard must be had also to offence of affray and to the principle of totality which his Honour mentioned, and to the finding that the offence was, indeed, in the worst case category. 
      
       
     166    Even taking into account the circumstance that his Honour classified the s 35 offence as in the worst category, and my conclusions in relation to the challenge to that view, the sentence is, in my view, a heavy one. However, having regard to those two circumstances, together with the offence of affray, I am unable to conclude that the sentence was outside the range legitimately available. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal against the sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
        
       SAKO 
        
       
     167    Sako raised a question of parity, not only with the Richard Adam sentence, but also with the sentence imposed on Esho. However, no further submissions were directed to this proposition.  
      
       
     168    I would reject the ground of appeal based on parity either with Richard Adam, or with Esho. The matters that were argued involved a challenge to the sentencing judge’s reasoning process which led to his findings of fact. For example, it was argued that a statement by his Honour that Sako: 
      
       
        
         
         “was involved in the assault upon him in concert with others, knowing that they were engaged in, at or about the time, ferocious battery of David Carty during which time he suffered gross serious injuries, to wit scalping.” 
         
        
        
       was contrary to the finding that Sako’s liability was accessorial. Particular focus was placed on the words “involved in”. As I understood the submission, it was that the finding of accessorial liability negated Sako’s being “involved in” the assault. This proposition cannot, in my view, be accepted. 
        
       
     169    The second error was really a re-statement of the first ground of appeal against conviction - that is, that, if those findings of fact are correct, the proper verdict would have been a conviction under s 33. The acquittal on that charge necessarily entailed that there was insufficient evidence to establish Sako’s knowledge of the ferocity of the attack upon Constable Carty. 
      
       
     170    I do not accept this. It may well be that the evidence was sufficient to establish a more serious charge than that on which the jury convicted. That does not mean that Sako has not been shown to have been aware of the numbers of men involved, or the nature of the attack.  
      
       
     171    Another complaint is that Abadee J failed properly to identify precisely what he found Sako had done. It is true that there is no precise statement in the remarks on sentence of Sako’s conduct, but, I take it, this is the reason that his Honour concluded that he had been found guilty, or should be treated as having been found guilty, as an accessory. That is the nature of accessorial liability. Having been found guilty as an accessory, Sako became liable for the acts carried out in the execution of the joint criminal enterprise.  
      
       
     172    I find no error in the assessment of criminality. 
      
       
     173    In this case also, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     174    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
       1.  
       Esho 
        
        
       (i) appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       (ii) leave to appeal against sentence granted, appeal dismissed. 
        
        
       2.  
       Sako 
        
       (i) appeal against conviction dismissed. 
        
        
       (ii) leave to appeal against sentence granted, appeal dismissed. 
        
       
     175    SMART AJ: I agree with Simpson J.

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
      
      
       
        
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Judge Blanch, the Chief Judge of the District Court. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years with a non-parole period of two years for a single offence of breaking, entering and stealing for which the prescribed maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. His Honour imposed that sentence after the applicant pleaded guilty and he was asked to take into account three further offences on a Form 1. 
     2 It is appropriate to make some reference to the background of offences of the applicant as they appeared before the sentencing judge. 
     3 The offence for which sentence was imposed was committed between 23 and 27 April 1999. The reference to “July” in the transcript is obviously a typing error. The three offences his Honour was asked to take into account were another offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 1 August 2000, a charge of possessing house breaking implements on the same date and a charge of larceny on 3 August 2000. 
     4 His Honour regarded it as important to analyse what he described as some of the applicant’s recent history. He noted that on 12 January 2000 the applicant had been before the District Court on appeal from a sentence imposed by a Magistrate in respect of charges of breaking, entering and stealing and goods in custody. He was sentenced to two months imprisonment and released on a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. On 17 June 1999 he had been dealt with in a Magistrate’s Court on two charges of breaking, entering and stealing and sentenced to a minimum term of one year dated to commence on 21 May 1999. 
     5 A number of matters were observed by his Honour. They included the commission of offences whilst on parole and it also may be observed that offences were committed very shortly after the applicant was from time to time released from custody. The applicant has apparently had a drug problem and there was put before his Honour a proposition that the applicant might be considered for the Salvation Army bridge programme. He had been assessed as suitable and there was a recommendation that he undergo that programme. His Honour noted a submission that the applicant should be given one last chance but reached the conclusion that the applicant had had such a final chance previously and failed to meet it. Accordingly, he imposed the sentence which I have indicated. 
     6 The applicant, in response to the Registrar’s direction, has put before this Court in writing three matters upon which he wishes to rely and has orally added a fourth matter. 
     7 The first matter asserted that the applicant applied for rehabilitation but that the judge did not take that into consideration. As I have indicated, his Honour made a specific finding in that regard, although it was not favourable to the applicant. Accordingly, it cannot be said that his Honour did not take it into consideration. 
     8 The second matter related to the applicant’s medical condition. I do not, for present purposes, need to specify all the detail but there has been handed to the Court today some pathology reports which confirm what he has said about the matter. He has also indicated that because of matters to which I shall turn concerning his present circumstances of custody, he is not receiving or at least is disadvantaged in receiving appropriate treatment. This is, of course, a matter which is subsequent to sentence and is a matter for the gaol authorities. It does not manifest error in the Court below that his Honour was unable to foresee the precise circumstances about which the applicant now speaks. 
     9 The third matter which the applicant raises is a matter which, had it been current at the time of sentence, might have given rise to the type of discount in sentence which is usually referred to by reference to the case of Queen v Cartwright. In the interests of the applicant I have indicated that I do not intend to elaborate the circumstances which he has detailed not only in the response to the Registrar but in another document which he has handed to the Court today. It is important that I record that the matters relating to this topic have been confirmed by inquiries on the part of the Crown and, for my part, I would strongly recommend to the Executive and to the prison authorities that assessment be made and consideration be given to the circumstances that the applicant has here raised. 
     10 However, as I have said, this is a matter which is entirely subsequent to sentence and, accordingly, it is not a matter which is appropriately investigated by this Court at this juncture. 
     11 I have explained to the applicant that the jurisdiction of this Court is enlivened by error and not by matters which are subsequent to the sentencing proceedings except in the most exceptional circumstances and these are not they. Fresh evidence is not received in order to determine the exercise of appeal jurisdiction. 
     12 The matter which the applicant raised orally concerned the discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty. The sentencing judge mentioned at the outset of his remarks that the applicant had pleaded guilty and later observed that he was entitled to consideration for the fact that he had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and he said that any sentence must reflect a discount not only for the contrition that that demonstrates but also for the saving of Court time.  
     13 Relatively recent authority has encouraged sentencing judges to specify the amount of any such discount with particular reference to the discount for what is generally referred to as the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. In this case his Honour referred to the saving of Court time. Whilst judges are encouraged so to do, it does not bespeak error to omit to do so. 
     14 Given the applicant’s record – and it is only to some of the recent matters that I have made reference – the sentence imposed clearly would have taken into account in the applicant’s favour the matters which his Honour said he was going to take into account in his favour. 
     15 Accordingly, I would repeat my commendation to the appropriate authorities that consideration be given to the matters raised by the applicant, with particular reference to the consequential effects which are taking place in relation to his custody.  
     16 That said however, as a matter of this Court’s jurisdiction, I am unpersuaded that a case for intervention can or has been established. Accordingly, I would grant the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     17 BELL J: I agree. 
     18 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will, therefore, be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v JOHN HERBERT SCOTT 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
      1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Nield DCJ at the Parramatta District Court. On that occasion the applicant appeared before his Honour charged upon indictment with supplying a prohibited drug, namely heroin, of not less than the commercial quantity and in the alternative of supplying that prohibited drug. The applicant pleaded guilty to the alternative count and was accordingly convicted. 
     2 I mention at the outset that three matters were taken into account on a form one. These related to essentially what might, I think, be called traffic matters although two of them were quite serious, but for present purposes I do not regard them as of great moment. 
     3 It is appropriate to sketch a little history which ultimately brought the applicant before the Court at Parramatta. The offences in the indictment were alleged to have occurred between January and August 1991. The evidence showed that the applicant's involvement would have become known to police in about 1994 when information was forthcoming from a co-offender. The applicant was then charged in 1996. The original charge against him was the more serious charge relating to the commercial quantity which is manifest in the first count of the indictment, which I have already mentioned, in respect of which the Crown accepted his plea of not guilty. However, that charge was earlier brought to trial before his Honour Judge Grogan and a jury and resulted in a conviction. Grogan DCJ sentenced the applicant to seven years imprisonment and a non-parole period of four years. At least he sentenced him in terms equivalent to those I have mentioned. 
     4 The applicant succeeded in an appeal to this Court. It can be mentioned that the appeal ground which was successful really had nothing to do with the merits of the matter but that does not seem to me to be relevant. A new trial was ordered and it was in relation to the presentation of the applicant for further trial that the Crown added the alternative to the indictment to which the applicant pleaded guilty. It should be observed, therefore, that the actual offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was not available to him until relatively recently. 
     5 The applicant had appeared before his Honour in February this year and thus it was some 10 years between offence and appearance before the District Court. 
     6 I would not regard the four years, or three years, which elapsed between 1991 and 1994 as particularly relevant to sentencing discretion. If investigating authorities are not in possession of appropriate information it can scarcely be complained of as a matter of disadvantage that a person's wrong doing has not been detected. It is important, however, to bear in mind that ultimately the wrong doing of the applicant is to be assessed in terms of the offence to which he actually pleaded guilty and not that which was outstanding between about 1996 and the early part of this year. 
     7 The applicant is forty four years of age. He has had, on the evidence before his Honour, a long term problem with addiction to heroin. No doubt at least in part as a consequence of that he has a significant criminal record. However, it might be observed that between 1992 and the present, and the current matter as I have said relates to events in 1991, the applicant has only twice been before courts, on neither occasion in relation to drug matters but overall, given his offending in the past it might be said there is at least slightly more than a glimmer of prospect that he may have the ability to turn around his previous conduct. 
     8 On behalf the applicant three grounds have been presented. They are in short; first, that the learned sentencing judge did not give sufficient weight to the staleness of the offence; second, that he erred in failing to find special circumstances (which was the case, and his Honour did not vary the statutory ratio) and; third, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Although his Honour was, as I have indicated, dealing with an offence which did not involve a Crown allegation relating to commercial quantity he nevertheless assessed the appropriate sentence at six years imprisonment. This was, it can be observed, but one year less than Grogan DCJ had imposed for the more serious offence. His Honour Judge Nield, however, did express the view that in his opinion the sentence earlier imposed was inadequate. It was not necessary for this court to express an opinion about that difference between the views of the two judges. 
     9 His Honour expressed himself as taking into account the applicant's plea of guilty and said that he would give him a discount of 20 percent for that reason. Rounding figures slightly, he then imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years and nine months with a non-parole period of three and a half years. It is, therefore, against that sentence that this application is brought. 
     10 In his remarks on sentence he made reference to the delay which is the subject of the first ground advanced on behalf of the applicant today. What his Honour said was ""frankly I cannot see how the delay in the prisoner being charged is either relevant or important in determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the prisoner for the offence of which he has pleaded guilty. However, the period between the commission of the particular offence and the imposition of punishment for that offence is both relevant and important in determining an appropriate sentence."" I would take his Honour to be referring to the total of ten years which had elapsed between the commission of the offence and the applicant appearing before him. In my view it is correct for the applicant to describe the offence as ""stale"" but that is not to say that appropriate punishment should not be imposed. 
     11 However that delay ought to work in favour of the applicant and yet, as the discount which I have mentioned would reveal if his Honour applied the discount as he said he would for the plea of guilty, it appears, although he has made this remark (of favour for delay), he has given the applicant no credit in respect of it. Indeed, other than the discount for the plea of guilty it can be seen that in his Honour's assessment there has been no other benefit towards the applicant's interest. 
     12 There is what I might describe as a peripheral matter which should be the subject of reference. At the outset of proceedings before Judge Neild in the usual fashion the Crown Prosecutor presented facts and addressed his Honour. He told the learned judge something of the curial history that had brought the matter before the Court and then stated, obviously in the presence of the applicant, ""I anticipate that Mr Gelbert will be submitting, bearing in mind that sentence was for a commercial quantity, the prosecution has now accepted a plea to supply simpliciter that the period of two years and twenty two days would meet the necessary criminality as a minimum term or as a fixed term if you like."" The learned Crown Prosecutor then went on to say he had been briefed in the matter in lieu of another prosecutor who was unavailable but then added "" that the prosecution concedes that your Honour would not be falling into any appealable error if your Honour accedes to that submission."" The period of two years and twenty two days represents time in custody pending the appeal which the applicant had served in respect of the offence. 
     13 In the course of Mr Gelbert's submissions on behalf of the applicant he made reference to that submission. It is obvious that his Honour had the impression therefrom and from what had been said by the Crown Prosecutor that both parties were inviting him to construct a sentence which would involve an acceptance that time served to the then present time would be sufficient and he said, after looking at some documents however that he needed to consider the position more fully ""before I accede to the proposition that you both have put forward."" Again, it must have occurred in the presence of the applicant and the Crown Prosecutor then sought to clarify his position and pointed out that, although he had said that the judge would not fall into appealable error, he was not submitting that such a sentence would be an appropriate result. 
     14 Given that background, it would be unsurprising if there was not created in the mind of the applicant or indeed any person in a similar position, an expectation as to what might happen. His Honour simply observed when he came to pass sentence that ""the Crown Prosecutor, although not making any submission as to sentence commented that if I was to sentence the prisoner to imprisonment for a fixed period of two years twenty two days, I would not fall into appealable error."" As is obvious from the balance of his Honour's remarks, his assessment was that a longer imposition should be made. 
     15 It would have been desirable if his Honour had perhaps elaborated his reasons for rejecting the matters which had been canvassed before him, importantly in the hearing of the applicant. If one were to combine those circumstances with the absence of any discount beyond the arithmetical discount which his Honour mentioned he would give for the plea of guilty, it would seem to me that circumstances are shown which make it appropriate for this court to intervene and reconsider the matter of sentence. 
     16 I have not, however, made reference to the other two grounds advanced on behalf the appellant. Simply to say that the sentence was manifestly excessive seems to me to carry little weight. An assessment of six years to be discounted for a plea of guilty would not seem to me to be outside the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
     17 That brings me to the final ground which asserts that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances. A finding of special circumstances is essentially a finding of fact. His Honour, when he came to that question, merely commented that he could not see any circumstances which he considered to be special. He mentioned the type of circumstances which may occur in various cases. There was evidence before him of the age of the applicant. I have already made some reference to the comparative absence of offending during a relatively long period during the decade last past which contrasts considerably with the applicant's record of persistently offending in his younger days. A submission was made in writing that the applicant could be regarded as at an age where long term users of illicit drugs can ""run out of steam"" and seek a lifestyle less active and turbulent. It is acknowledged that the applicant has been in gaol for a number of years but in recent years he seems to have modified his lifestyle. That would seem to be confirmed by the absence of adverse encounters with the law to any great extent during the 1990s. It appears to me then, therefore, that there is, as I have earlier said, more than a glimmer of real prospect that rehabilitation might be able to be achieved. Accordingly, I think, given the evidence it can be concluded, although perhaps marginally, that his Honour's determination that there were no special circumstances to be found, was wrong. 
     18 I would propose, therefore, that the following orders be made. The application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal allowed. The sentence below quashed but there be reimposed upon the second count of the indictment imprisonment for a term of four years and nine months to commence on 15 March 1999 and I would specify a non-parole period of two years eight months to commence on 15 March 1999 and, therefore, to expire on 14 November 2001 upon which date the applicant would be eligible for consideration for parole. 
     19 BELL J: I agree. 
     20 GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v Joseph Hana Kalife RAHME 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 MASON P: The appellant and two others (Cane Pejovski and Zivko Bunevski) were jointly indicted on the charge that  
      
       
       on 10 December 1997 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did without reasonable excuse attempt to obtain possession of prohibited imports to which section 233B of the  
       Customs Act 1901 
        applied, namely, narcotic good consisting of a quantity of 3, 4 methylenediozymethamphetamine (MDMA) being not less than the trafficable quantity application to MDMA which had been imported into Australia in contravention of the said Act. 
       
     2 The trial took place in the District Court before Wall ADCJ in May-June 2000. On 2 June 2000 the appellant and Mr Bunevski were found guilty. The jury were unable to agree in respect of Mr Pejovski. 
     3 The prosecution case was circumstantial. A package containing 214g of pure Ecstasy was intercepted by customs officers when it arrived in Australia. It was addressed to “Beck Architectural Company, 73 Vaumans Road, Peakhurst”. It later transpired that the intended address was 73 Baumans Road Peakhurst which was Pejovski’s home under renovation. 
     4 The package (containing a much reduced quantity of Ecstasy) was delivered to the home. Pejovski signed for it and took possession of it and he stored it in a locked shed. He later gave the key to the shed to Bunevski who subsequently travelled with the appellant by taxi to the address and collected the package. All three men were arrested shortly afterwards. 
     5 There was evidence from the taxi driver that the appellant had given directions, showing the driver a piece of paper with the words “Baumans Road” on it. When they arrived, the appellant told the taxi driver “we are going back to Rockdale, park on [or around] the corner … not in front of the house”. The appellant came back to the taxi carrying a plastic bag which was found to contain the drug. 
     6 The main issue at trial was whether it was proved that each accused was intentionally in possession of the controlled delivery with the requisite belief or awareness of the likelihood that the package contained a trafficable quantity of the drug. There was evidence capable of establishing guilt against each accused. 
     7 Each accused gave evidence denying awareness or belief. Bunevski and the appellant each claimed that the other misled him. 
     8 At trial Bunevski testified that he had been told that the package was “for Mr Rackman” (sic, ie the appellant) although he believed that it contained “divorce papers”. He testified that the appellant asked him to accompany him to 73 Baumans Road to pick up the package. 
     9 By contrast the appellant testified that he had been asked by Bunevski to accompany him to an address in Peakhurst and that at some point along the way Bunevski told him that he wanted to “pick [up] a gift from his Aussie friend’s house in Peakhurst arriving from overseas”. 
     10 There are three grounds of appeal and they are related, namely: 
      
       
       Ground 1. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of statements made by the appellant in his record of interview. 
        
       Ground 2. The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the evidence of statements made by the appellant in his record of interview could be used only in respect of his credibility. 
        
       Ground 3. The trial judge erred in refusing to separate the trials of the appellant and his co-accused. 
       
     11 A separate trial application had been rejected by Rummery DCJ on 25 October 1999. 
     12 Applications for separate trials were renewed before Wall ADCJ on 8 May 2000. They were rejected. As regards the appellant, the learned judge indicated that the argument for a separate trial proceeded on the basis that the appellant’s record of interview would be admitted into evidence (AB 72-3). His Honour added that the record of interview appeared to be consistent with an induced statement given by the appellant on the same day, the inference being that the appellant was unlikely to be disputing the material in the record of interview. 
     13 On the day of his arrest on 10 December 1997, the appellant was taken to Australian Federal Police Headquarters. He was brought handcuffed to an interview room and interviewed by two federal police officers named Barrett and Purcell. The record of interview is quite a lengthy one, spanning the period between 4.11pm and 5.40pm (646 questions).  
     14 When the prosecutor sought to tender the video record of the interview, counsel representing the appellant objected. He referred inter alia to s84 of the Evidence Act 1995. That provides: 
      
       
       84(1) 
        Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the court is satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by: 
        
       (a) violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct, whether towards the person who made the admission or towards another person; or 
        
       (b) a threat of conduct of that kind. 
        
       (2)  
       Subsection (1) only applies if the party against whom evidence of the admission is adduced has raised in the proceedings an issue about whether the admission or its making were so influenced. 
       
     15 A voir dire was conducted. 
     16 Mr Purcell said: 
      
       
       And as best I can recall … just prior to the interview commencing I said to him, “so you are going to cooperate with police today”. He said, “yes, sir” and then I foolishly said to him, “well, that’s good. If you cooperate with police today it may be a merry Christmas after all” (Tr p267)  
       
     17 Mr Purcell agreed that his remarks carried an implied, albeit unintended, threat that if the appellant did not cooperate he might spend Christmas in custody (Tr pp273-4). The transcript of the record of interview also revealed that the appellant regarded Purcell’s words as an inducement (see A633-643). 
     18 It is hardly surprising that the prosecutor indicated that the Crown did not intend to rely on the record of interview and withdrew the tender (Tr p276). The trial judge therefore did not have to rule on the voluntariness of the record of interview. He contented himself with remarking [AB 370]: 
      
       
       Although I had no concluded view about it I must say I was very, very concerned as to the compromised integrity of the record of interview. It was not only an inducement but the converse was a threat or an implied threat. And in the background a man having been handcuffed and taken into custody was going to raise all sorts of problems but be that as it may I will have that noted. 
       
     19 The trial proceeded to completion without the issue of voluntariness being revisited. The Crown never suggested that the appellant’s answers in what can now be described as the excluded record of interview could go to the jury as evidence of the appellant’s guilt. Unfortunately, the appellant’s co-accused effectively did so, and the jury were permitted to do so. 
     20 Immediately after the rejection of applications for directed verdicts at the close of the Crown case there was discussion about the use that could be made of the excluded record of interview. 
     21 Counsel for Bunevski stated that all parties had assumed at the outset that the record of interview would be admitted into evidence. Nevertheless, he made it clear that he wished to be in a position to cross-examine the appellant in the interests of his client by putting to him any inconsistencies between his sworn evidence at trial and what he had said in the record of interview (Tr pp451-3). It was agreed between counsel for Bunevski and counsel for the appellant that rulings would be sought as to the appropriate limits of cross-examination at the conclusion of the evidence in chief of their respective clients (Tr pp453-4). 
     22 Counsel returned to the issue a few days later. Reference was made to s104(6) of the Evidence Act which states: 
      
       
        Leave is not to be given for cross-examination by another defendant unless: (a) the evidence that the defendant to be cross-examined has given ..includes evidences adverse to the defendant seeking leave to cross-examine and (b) that evidence has been admitted. 
       
     23 There was also reference to s103(1) which stipulates that: 
      
       
       The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination of a witness if the evidence has substantial probative value. 
       
     24 Counsel for the appellant submitted that Mr Bunevski should not be permitted to cross-examine the appellant by using the record of interview (a) because that document was not in evidence in the Crown case and (b) because to do so would be unfairly prejudicial (contrary to ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act). 
     25 The learned trial judge said this (Tr 23 May 2000 pp 6-7, transcript partially corrected, emphasis added): 
      
       
       It 
        [the record of interview] 
        could only have been admitted as statements made by accused which could be before the jury for the purpose of considering that evidence in relation to the over all evidence of the Crown against the accused, Mr Rahme. For the Crown to be able to lead that evidence as evidence relevant to the guilt of the accused, the Crown would have to establish that it was voluntary and that there was no requirement for it to be excluded in the exercise of the court’s discretion….  
       That in my view does not prevent the statements that were made by Mr Rahme to the police about the subject matter of the very charge or the topic relevant to the very charge being a matter of cross-examination by a co-accused in his case, where a co-accused is claiming that he is innocent of any wrong doing and has been led into the net so to speak by the conduct of the co-accused 
       . 
        
       ELLIS 
        (counsel for the appellant at trial) 
       : It follows from that, if there is a matter of consistency, I would then be entitled to cross-examine Mr Bunevski in relation to statements he made to the police which had been excluded you had  
       (sic) 
       . 
        
       HIS HONOUR: Certainly they come under no different category. They’re prior statements made. In relation to the fact that the jury would be aware that there were conversations between Mr Bunevski and conversation and the police and the conversation between Mr Rahme and the police that can be the subject of the directions to the jury that they confine their attention to the evidence in the trial and not speculate how matters were discussed. As I see it …, each co-accused is entitled should the witness give evidence in the witness box adverse to an accused’s interest in this trial, then each co-accused is entitled to cross-examine the witness accused on matters affecting the credit of the witness accused, provided that the matters have substantial probative value. And that means a very substantial and I now using the words of the Supreme Court in …  
       Nikau 
         
       [Howie AJ, unreported, 23 October 1997] 
       , there must be very substantial connection between the evidence sought to be admitted and the effect that it can have upon the witness’s credibility. As an overview so to speak  
       insofar as the record of interview deals with statements made by a witness accused to the police about the very matter going to the root of the charge, I would have thought that there would have been manifest a very substantial connection. It is difficult to imagine a more substantial connection because he’s making statements about the very matter the subject of the police investigation that led to the charge. 
       
     26 The appellant submits that the passage that I have just set out contain two distinct rulings: 
      
       
      1. that statements of the appellant in the excluded record of interview relating to the events of 10 December 1997 (ie directly relevant to the offence charged) could be adduced by a co-accused in cross-examination where it was adduced for the purpose of establishing the innocence of the co-accused. 
       
       
      2. that evidence of statements made to the police in the excluded record of interview which were inconsistent with his testimony in the trial, which counsel for Bunevski proposed to adduce in cross-examination of the appellant, had substantial probative value (cf s103) and thus the credibility exclusionary rule (cf s102) did not apply. Accordingly, leave was granted pursuant to s104(2) for the proposed cross-examination of the appellant. 
       
     27 I agree with this analysis. Had matters remained there, there would still have been very real problems in achieving a fair trial given the difficulty that the jury would have had in separating material adduced in cross-examination of the appellant that could (1) support the case of his co-accused and (2) undermine the appellant’s credibility but not (3) operate as substantive evidence in the trial of the appellant adverse to the appellant’s interests. The appellant’s credibility as a witness was indiscerptible. 
     28 However, later developments showed that the judge permitted material from the excluded record of interview to be treated as substantive evidence adverse to the appellant’s interests in his own case. 
     29 At one stage during discussion with counsel on 23 May 2000 the trial judge indicated that evidence adduced by cross-examination of one co-accused would be evidence in the joint trial generally. The exchange with counsel was: 
      
       
       THANGARAJ  
       (counsel for Bunevski) 
       : I ask the cross-cross-examination by defence counsel, based on material otherwise excluded, be limited to the case of the accused for whom the question is being asked. If Mr Ellis asked Mr Bunevski, you said to the police there was no phone call in the cab and you also said that you never spoke to Vlado in the taxi, that evidence, because it was otherwise inadmissible, be limited to the case of Mr Rahme. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: No, I can’t do that. I won’t do that. Any evidence that is given in the witness box, on oath, which by cross-examination, which is within the permissible area of questions that may be asked, is evidence in the trial. 
        
       That’s why I said it is a matter where counsel for each co-accused will have to be very circumspect about what matters they open up in cross-examination of the co-accused. Because the questions, if the question is admissible that is within the ruling I gave in relation to credibility, any answer that is given is evidence in the trial, and it is a matter to be considered by the jury in relation to all three cases, or all four cases I should say.  
       
     30 His Honour also adverted to the likelihood that s165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act would be engaged, thereby triggering a judicial warning as to the unreliability of the evidence of a criminal associate concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding. 
     31 Later, after the appellant had given evidence in chief, counsel for Bunevski took his Honour back to these rulings in order to clarify what he would be permitted to do in cross-examination of the appellant. The judge effectively confirmed the two rulings summarised at par 26 above, without any remarks restricting the impact of the cross-examination to the case of the party seeking to adduce it by cross examination (Tr 251 on 29 May 2000). 
     32 While cross examining the appellant, counsel for Bunevski made extensive reference to the record of interview by the police on 10 December 1997. Several of the appellant’s answers were put to him. And, when he had agreed with the record, he was challenged either as to the substance of his evidence, as to credit, or on both bases.  
     33 For example, there was the following cross examination by counsel for Bunevski (Tr p263 29/05/00): 
      
       
       Q. You told the police at question 138 “he grabbed something from inside the shed and he tried to get out. I said ‘give me that, I took the bags off him, to push the door for him and we went out, we jumped in a taxi”? 
        
       A: I don’t remember sir, I’m sorry. 
        
       THANGARAJ: He would have to have a copy of the document. He has to at least agree that he told the police that. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: What is the question? 
        
       THANGARAJ: 138. He told the police “give me that --- 
        
       ELLIS: It is an excerpt from a long answer. I concede that the portion there correctly states part of the answer. It has only partly been to put the witness and I am quite happy for it to be put in front of him. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: It is conceded by Mr Ellis, on behalf of the accused Rahme, that when he was questioned by the police he gave an answer to the effect that when Bunevski was in the shed at Baumans Road on that day, 10 December, that Bunevski grabbed something from inside the shed and tried to get out and that Rahme told the police that he said, that he Rahme said, “Give me that, I took the bags off him, to push the door for him and we went out, we jumped in a taxi”. 
        
       THANGARAJ: Q: What you told the police was that you said “Give me that”. You never said that Bunevski said “Hang on to that”? 
        
       A. I don’t remember sir. 
        
       Q. Because you lied in Court on Friday? 
        
       A. Never sir. 
        
       Q. You agree that they are completely inconsistent answers? 
        
       A. I don’t know sir. 
       
     34 Several other statements in the withdrawn record of interview were put to the appellant by counsel for Bunevski on the basis that they were lies minimising the appellant’s involvement and showing consciousness of guilt. 
     35 In the summing up the jury were told (in conventional terms) that the evidence in relation to one accused could differ from the evidence available against another accused (SU p8). Later, the jury were reminded of the evidence given by each accused as a witness. The jury were told, in fairly general terms, that the appellant’s case (like that of his co-accused) was that he was an innocent dupe: in particular that he was a victim of Bunevski misleading him about picking up a shopping bag for someone who had sent a gift from overseas (SU 60). 
     36 In the absence of the jury there was discussion about the giving of a direction to the effect that all of the evidence led in the trial was admissible against all accused (SU 64). It would appear that counsel were specifically addressing evidence in relation to certain telephone records. What the jury were told was (SU 68-9): 
      
       
       Well I have been reminded by counsel that at the outset I indicated to you that there might be evidence admitted in a case that was admissible against a particular accused only and not against the other accused, and for example, when the telephone records were first tendered and admitted by me in relation to the telephone records between Bunevski and Rahme, on 1st, 2nd, 6th and 9th December, that they were admissible in relation to Rahme and Bunevski only and not Pejovski. But, the way the case has been conducted members of the jury, with each accused going into the witness box and questions being asked and the telephone records being the subject of evidence in the witness box on oath etcetera, all counsel are agreed that the evidence in this trial now is evidence in all cases. Do you understand that? That the evidence that was formerly confined to a particular accused, is now evidence in relation to all cases for you to consider, because all counsel from time to time have referred to particular evidence and there has been evidence given from the witness box about it and there was an opportunity to cross-examine on it. 
       
     37 The jury were given no directions as to the limited use to which they might put the cross-examination of the appellant based upon his excluded record of interview. The passage from the summing up that I have just quoted must have reinforced in their mind the propriety of making general use of any evidence adduced in the cross-examination of the appellant, including cross-examination referring to and based upon the appellant’s answers in the excluded record of interview. 
     38 In these circumstances there must be a new trial, because Bunevski’s counsel put before the jury “evidence of an admission” by the appellant that was excluded by s84 of the Evidence Act and because of the real possibility that the jury relied upon this evidence in proceeding to their guilty verdict against the appellant.  
     39 The record of interview was withdrawn because all concerned perceived that the trial judge was not going to be satisfied that the admission, and the making of the admission, were not influenced by “oppressive” conduct or a threat of such conduct. This case is not an appropriate vehicle to explore the inner or outer limits of the concept of “oppressive conduct”. It is sufficient that an objection based on s84 had been taken and, following the voir dire, the Crown withdrew the record of interview. The appellant never thereafter waived his objection to the admissibility of the record of interview and the judge was never thereafter invited to revisit the issue of whether he was satisfied of the matters stated in the terms of s84(1). 
     40 The rulings permitting Bunevski’s counsel to use the record of interview (albeit in Bunevski’s interests) and the failure thereafter to direct the jury in any way to confine themselves as regards consideration of that evidence in the context of Bunevski’s case (assuming that to have been practically possible) meant that evidence which was not made admissible against the appellant went to the jury as evidence of his guilt. 
     41 The Crown submitted that Bunevski’s counsel’s use of the record of interview did not constitute the admission of “evidence of an admission” within s84(1). I cannot agree. The Dictionary in the Evidence Act defines “admission” to mean: 
      
       
       … a previous representation that is: 
        
         
          
          (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
     42 When counsel for Bunevski got the appellant to agree with the contents of the record of interview in circumstances where those answers were put before the jury; and when those answers were used to attack the appellant’s credibility as a witness in the trial generally and thereby to undermine his own case that it had been Bunevski who duped him, the “previous representation” embodied in the excluded record of interview was being used in a manner adverse to the appellant’s interest in the outcome of his trial (see R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426). 
     43 The questioning should not have been permitted and the jury should not have been left free to use it inter alia to the detriment of the appellant’s case. 
     44 The Crown invoked the proviso, but this was not a case where the court could be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage occurred. 
     45 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Set aside the conviction and sentence. 
       
       
      3. New trial ordered. 
       
     46 LEVINE J: I agree with Mason P. 
     47 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed and reasons given by Mason P.

      REGINA v STEVEN GRANT GROAT 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment.  
      
       
     2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Andrew A/DCJ at the Cowra District Court. The applicant appeared before his Honour and pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying a prohibited drug, in each case methylamphetamine. 
      
       
     3 The facts, I regret to say, could almost be described as mundane. At about 12.30 pm on 30 May an undercover police officer contacted the applicant by mobile phone. Arrangements were made and there was a sale of what turned out to be 2.83 grams of methylamphetamine after the applicant arrived in his motor vehicle. He paid the undercover officer $350, which was said to be an over-payment. Consequently at about 1.45 pm on the same day there was another contact with the applicant and an amount of 3.2 grams of the same drug was supplied, as a result of a similar transaction, this time for $120, the discount apparently representing the over-payment for the first transaction. These two supplies constituted the first two counts charged against the applicant.  
      
       
     4 The third count arose out of the execution of a search warrant at the applicant's home on 7 June. The search detected a white powder and 30.52 grams of methylamphetamine were located in the possession of the applicant.  
      
       
     5 The learned judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years concurrently on each count and specified a non-parole period of two years.  
      
       
     6 The applicant in this Court has canvassed three grounds on his application. As I am of the view that one of the matters raised has been made out, I can deal relatively briefly with the other two. I turn to do so. The submission was advanced that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give the applicant credit for contrition. In the course of sentencing his Honour had observed “firstly he cooperated with the police and he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. Whilst he probably had little choice, having been caught red-handed, nevertheless he has cooperated and the utilitarian effect of the plea has saved the expense and time of a trial. I assess the plea of guilty as amounting to a discount on his sentence of twenty-five percent”.  
      
       
     7 It was complained that the judge made no reference to the matter of contrition. It was not a matter advanced on behalf of the applicant, but it might be observed in passing that in Regina v Thomson 2000 49 NSWLR 383 the Chief Justice [at paragraphs 135 and 136] referred to the necessity for separation of the elements of contrition and the utilitarian value of the plea and expressed a view, agreed by the other members of the court, that the strength of the Crown case should not have any bearing upon the weight to be attributed to the aspect of discount that relates to the utilitarian value. Although his Honour made no express reference to the issue of contrition, I am unpersuaded that any error is manifest in his dealing with the applicant and I would reject the argument advanced. 
      
       
     8 Similarly I would reject the argument that the sentence was manifestly excessive for the offences. Part of the applicant's subjective case revealed that he was the father of six children and the stepfather of two others. For a person aged thirty-nine years in his position to involve himself in the distribution of illicit drugs into the community is a matter of considerable seriousness. One is given pause to wonder whether, if another had supplied his own children, the applicant would be so sanguine as he appears to be in relation to this matter.  
      
       
     9 I turn however to the matter which I have indicated I consider the applicant has made out. In the course of his remarks on sentence the learned judge referred to the applicant's prior record. This was by no means clear and included a drug offence. In reference to that his Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The cultivation charge is said to relate to the growing of a few plants of marijuana in a forest and the sentence imposed would support that. Although the sentence for the supply of a prohibited drug was only a sixty hours community service order, nevertheless he has a prior conviction which is an aggravating feature."" 
         
        
       
     10 The contention is advanced that his Honour erred in treating this prior conviction as an aggravating feature. As a matter of principle the learned Crown Prosecutor in a written submission has made an appropriate concession that the fact of prior convictions can never, unless specifically legislated for, be used in the sentencing process as an aggravating feature. It is pointed out, and I would endorse the proposition, that an aggravating feature relates to something which makes the instant conduct more serious. A prior record is something which is capable of depriving an offender of leniency that otherwise might be merited. Mr Dawe QC who has appeared for the Crown, has argued that the sentencing judge's remarks, treated as a whole, should be construed so as to understand his reference to an aggravating feature as being a contemplation relating to lenience in the light that I have mentioned. I am unable to accept that submission. What his Honour said is plain in its terms and it is, as conceded, erroneous. What the Court does not know is what effect that error had upon the imposition which he concluded should be made. Nevertheless, as the ground has been made out, it is apt for this Court to consider the question of re-sentence. 
      
       
     11 It should always be borne in mind that the jurisdiction of this Court when dealing with a matter of sentence is to consider, pursuant to section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, whether some other sentence more or less severe is warranted. There is before the Court material relating to the progress of the applicant whilst in prison. There has also been some attention paid to a matter which scarcely does the applicant credit. In the proceedings in the District Court his wife gave evidence. She testified that he himself was not a user of drugs. Thus the learned sentencing judge understandably approached the matter on the basis that the applicant involved himself in crime for commercial reasons. The matter now tendered before the Court asserts that the applicant himself was, at least to a recreational extent, a user of drugs. Given the circumstance that his wife must either have lied or been ignorant of his usage, the important circumstance is that the applicant permitted that matter to go uncorrected before the sentencing judge. It seems to me that there is no reason why this Court should place any credence upon assertions emanating from the applicant.  
      
       
     12 When sentencing him the learned judge found that there were special circumstances justifying a departure from the proportions between the head sentence and the non-parole period specified in the relevant statute. Whilst I have some reservations about his Honour's findings in that regard, I have come to the conclusion that, to an extent, they should not be the subject of any departure by this Court.  
      
       
     13 I would therefore propose the following orders, that the application for leave to appeal be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
      
       
     14 On each count to imprisonment for a period of two years and six months to date from 7 June 2000, each of those sentences to be served concurrently. 
      
       
     15 I would specify a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 7 June 2000 and to expire on 6 December 2001. 
      
       
     16 I would order that the applicant be released to parole on 6 December 2001. 
      
       
     17 WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. I wish to add some brief observations. So far as it was submitted that the objective seriousness of the applicant's criminality was limited by reason of the fact that the substance here involved was amphetamine, and the amount involved was not substantial, I would disagree. The supply of amphetamine in a traffickable quantity, for profit, remains a serious offence. It was in my view utterly reprehensible that a thirty-nine year old man, who was the father of six children aged between three and seventeen years, elected to stoop to the supply of this substance, bearing in mind the extent that the younger members of this community resort to its use, and also bearing in mind the consequences for them. It is impossible to accept that any father could ignore that reality. It is equally impossible to give credence to the expression of contrition which he later offered for his conduct. That expression of contrition, I believe, was baseless. However, it is by reason of the error which Grove J has identified that I consider that this Court should intervene. The orders of the Court will therefore be as his Honour has proposed.

      TONY WISBEY V REGINA (NSW) 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Sides QC, on 20 July 2000 following his pleas of guilty to a series of offences. They may be briefly noted. 
      
       
       Count upon indictment  
       
     2 This involved an offence of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years: (s 66C (1) of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence for which the maximum available sentence is imprisonment for eight years). In relation to this count an offence of aggravated indecent assault was also taken into account. 
      
       
     3 The offence the subject of the indictment occurred in May 1997 and involved a thirteen year old boy who had been staying with the applicant. It occurred when the applicant sucked the boy's penis while he was asleep in his bed, causing him to awake. He had been on bail for an earlier sexual assault at the time of its commission.  
      
       
     4 The offence on the form 1 occurred over the Easter weekend in 1998. On this occasion, again during the night, the applicant touched the same boy in the area of his genitals.  
      
       
     5 When this matter came before his Honour on 26 November 1999, it was stood over by way of a Griffiths remand until 26 May 2000, to enable the applicant to develop a co-operative relationship with a counsellor in order that he might address the disability and the personal problems which I will later mention, and to prove himself to the Court. He was required, as a condition of his bail, to accept the reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service in relation to counselling and therapy.  
      
       
     6 His Honour took this course notwithstanding the fact that the matter had previously been adjourned for six months for a similar purpose. His Honour did, however, make it clear to the applicant that if he did not co-operate and show signs of progress, his bail would be revoked and he could expect to receive a gaol sentence. 
      
       
     7 When the matter came back before his Honour on 29 May 2000 it became apparent that the applicant had not co-operated in relation to counselling and his bail was then rescinded. 
      
       
        
       Section 51A Document 
       
     8 This encompassed the following counts: 
      
       
       Count 1 - Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the circumstance of aggravation relating to the fact that the victim was under the age of sixteen years, (s 61J Crimes Act) an offence for which the maximum available penalty was imprisonment for twenty years); 
        
        Count 2 - Same offence as that involved in Count 1; 
        
        Count 3 - Same offence as that involved in Count 1. 
        
       
     9 These matters came before his Honour on 20 July 2000, following pleas of guilty entered in the Queanbeyan Local Court earlier that day. As a consequence, they were dealt with at the same time as the offence on the indictment, thereby allowing the applicant to be sentenced upon a totality basis.  
      
       
     10 Counts 1 and 2 involved another thirteen year old boy and occurred in April 2000 at the applicant's home. Each involved acts of oral intercourse. The offence involved in Count 3 occurred between January and May 1999. The victim, on this occasion, was an eight year old boy who similarly was subjected to an act of oral intercourse.  
      
       
     11 These three offences occurred while the applicant was on bail for the offence which was included in the indictment, that being an offence to which he had pleaded guilty on 6 August 1999. Additionally, the year 2000 offences were committed during the period of the Griffiths remand. 
      
       
        
       The sentences  
       
     12 The sentences passed by his Honour were as follows: 
      
       
       
       (a) Offence on indictment, (taking into account the form 1 matter) - fixed term of eighteen months to commence on 19 May 2000 and to expire on 18 November 2001; 
       
     13 (b) Counts 1 to 3 on the s 51A document, four years' imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently with each other but cumulatively upon the fixed term for the offence on the indictment, commencing accordingly on 19 November 2001 and expiring on 18 November 2005. A non-parole period of two years was fixed for these offences commencing on 19 November 2001 and expiring on 18 November 2003.  
      
       
        
       Subjective circumstances 
       
     14 In sentencing the applicant his Honour took into account the disability with which he had been born in August 1965 as a consequence of his mother having contracted Rubella during her pregnancy. This had left him with a condition of deafness and deficient literacy abilities, associated with the fact that, while he had been taught to lip-read, he had never learned sign language. 
      
       
     15 His Honour accepted that as a consequence he had not been able to form appropriate sexual and social relationships, particularly within the isolated community of Araluen where he lived. He was found to be emotionally and socially very immature, and to be more comfortable in the company of the young boys with whom he has mainly associated, and who shared his interest in trail bikes, model aeroplanes, computers and similar activities. 
      
       
     16 Additionally, it was established that he suffered from Crohn's Disease, a condition involving inflammation of the bowel which had necessitated a number of operations including an ileostomy in 1996. Although not diagnosed as suffering from any form of psychiatric illness, he had from time to time engaged in suicidal gestures and threats leading to admission to a psychiatric hospital on one occasion. 
      
       
     17 He was aged thirty-five years when he appeared for sentence. He had been educated to the age of fourteen years, was able to read and write and had considerable computer, electronic and mechanical aptitudes, particularly in relation to motor mechanics. He was in receipt of a disability pension which he supplemented by seasonal fruit picking and by the sale of vegetables which he grew himself. He was somewhat isolated from his parents although he maintained limited contact with them. 
      
       
     18 The material before his Honour left him satisfied that while his grandmother and other members of the local community had endeavoured to keep an eye on the applicant, and to ensure that he avoided the company of young boys, they had not been particularly successful in this regard.  
      
       
     19 Further, the material left his Honour satisfied that he had in the past declined to take responsibility for his offending, and had refused to move to Queanbeyan where he would have had access to appropriate services. However, his presence in such a larger community, it was recognised, might have increased his risk of re-offending. 
      
       
     20 The applicant's disabilities, his Honour recognised, meant that he would be ""An extraordinarily vulnerable individual"" within the prison system. It was for this reason that he had been held on strict protection since being taken into custody on 19 May 2000. 
      
       
     21 It was the case that he had a prior record of dishonesty, and of sexual offences involving young boys, which had been dealt with by recognisance, bonds and community service orders. One such bond was current at the time of the offence on the indictment, while a recognisance for an offence of sexual assault was current at the time of the offence in the form 1. 
      
       
     22 The further material placed before his Honour in July 2000 left him with the impression that there had been some progress and hope for the future, so far as the applicant had established a degree of rapport with a psychologist. On the other hand, it was the fact that two of the offences included in the s 51A document had occurred during this period of counselling. Furthermore, the pre-sentence report expressed continuing concerns of a serious kind which tended to cast a significant doubt upon the extent to which the applicant had developed any insight into his conduct and upon the question whether he had any favourable prospects of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     23 This report disclosed that in April 2000 the applicant had been barred from a refuge in Queanbeyan due to his aggressive and threatening behaviour. In May he had received fines totalling $1,600 in relation to a series of driving offences. He had also admitted to associating with boys in breach of his earlier bail conditions and he had become subject to an apprehended violence order following a complaint to the effect that he had been video taping them. 
      
       
     24 Ken Mayes, the unit leader of the Queanbeyan office of the Probation and Parole Service, advised that, by reason of strong local feeling, the applicant would be unable to return to Araluen. His report concluded: 
      
       
        
         
         ""In relation to sentencing options, Mr Wisbey remains unsuitable for a community service order or periodic detention. It is considered that at present Mr Wisbey cannot be effectively supervised by this Service in the community. He has no suitable accommodation and his behaviour and attitude indicate that he is an unacceptable risk in the community. Consequently, and despite Mr Wisbey's disability, a custodial sentence appears appropriate. Such a sentence may serve to impress upon Mr Wisbey the seriousness and unacceptable nature of his behaviour and could encourage him to accept responsibility for his actions. 
          
          
         Because of his disability, Mr Wisbey is not suitable for the sex offender programmes as they are conducted in groups. However enquiries with the Forensic Services Unit indicate that if Mr Wisbey is imprisoned, classification to the Long Bay Sex Offender Unit would be appropriate. Assessment of his communication skills would be undertaken and programmes arranged to address needs in this area. There is also a possibility that individual specialist counselling in relation to his sexual offending will be provided. A custodial sentence will also enable Mr Wisbey, with the assistance of this Service, to develop an appropriate pre-release plan. It is anticipated that such a plan could include supported/supervised accommodation, ongoing counselling and personal development opportunities. 
          
         
        
       
     25 His Honour found that the applicant's lack of insight and his continued offending, while on strict bail and subject to a Griffiths remand, meant that he was a danger to the community. This finding could not be seriously challenged in the light of the applicant's history which, unfortunately, places him into the category of a repeat offender with limited insight or ability to control himself.  
      
       
     26 In sentencing the applicant his Honour expressly took into account every circumstance that could possibly have operated in his favour commencing with the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. While recognising that there was no strong evidence of contrition, his Honour accepted that this could in part be attributed to his disabilities which hindered his capacity to gain insight into his criminality. As a result he considered it appropriate also to extend some leniency based on the contrition evidenced by the pleas.  
      
       
     27 His Honour also made it clear that because of his disabilities he was entitled to have his sentence mitigated as ""He is not an appropriate individual to be made an example of"". His criminality was dealt with on a totality basis. Express account was taken of the fact that his disabilities, and the fact that he would need to serve his sentence upon protection, would render his custodial sentence more burdensome than usual.  
      
       
     28 Special circumstances were found with regard to the need for an extended period of post-release supervision and counselling, to the fact that he would serve the sentence on probation and to the fact that there would be an accumulation of sentence. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal 
       
     29 It was the applicant's submission that the sentences imposed were excessive and in particular that, in imposing an accumulation of sentences, too much weight was given to general deterrence. Further, it was submitted that the objectives of punishment and rehabilitation could have been sufficiently dealt with by way of periodic detention or a suspended sentence. 
      
       
     30 In my view, the appeal is without merit. On the contrary, his Honour gave careful, compassionate and considered attention to every facet of the matter. The offences were serious. They were repetitive and they were accompanied by circumstances of aggravation so far as they occurred while the applicant was on bail or subject to a recognisance or during a period of a Griffiths remand: R v Readman (1990) 47 ACR 181.  
      
       
     31 Regrettably, and by reason of his disabilities and lack of insight, the applicant remains at a serious risk of re-offending notwithstanding the many attempts that counselling which have been made. His future prospects are very poor and other sentencing options have failed.  
      
       
     32 In my view, the approach taken by his Honour was entirely justified and the case is not one where the accumulation erroneously gave undue weight to the interest of general deterrence. On the contrary, his Honour expressly recognised that such interest was unimportant, in this case. What the accumulation did appropriately reflect was the totality of the criminality involved, in accordance with the authorities conveniently noted by Smart AJ in R v Tripodina (2001) NSW CCA 136. There clearly was a need to punish the offender, and to provide a personal deterrent for him which the sentencing options previously employed had failed to achieve. The fact of accumulation was otherwise allowed for as a special circumstance. 
      
       
     33 Neither periodic detention nor a suspended sentence would have been appropriate for an offender with the applicant's record, particularly for one who was appearing for sentence in relation to the number and type of offences here involved, each of which involved the utterly unacceptable sexual invasion of young boys. It is also not unimportant. in this regard that it was the assessment of the Probation and Parole Service, based on a long association with the applicant dating back to 1995, that it was unable to effectively supervise him in the community.  
      
       
     34 Being unpersuaded that an error of law has been shown, while I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.  
      
       
     35 However, I would wish to add that it is important for the Corrections System to pay proper regard to the special needs of this applicant, concerning both his communication difficulties and his feeding problems relating to the ileostomy. It is their duty to ensure that those medical needs are addressed and not ignored as his solicitor suggested from the Bar table has been the case. It also seems to me appropriate that at some stage, during his period of incarceration, attempts should be made to provide one on one counselling, directed towards rehabilitation in relation to the kind of offending behaviour which brought him before the Court.  
      
       
     36 GROVE J: I agree with the judgment of Justice Wood and the orders which he proposed. I associate myself with the final remarks concerning the treatment of the applicant while in custody.  
      
       
     37 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will, therefore, be as I proposed. A copy of these remarks should be provided to the Corrective Service.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him by Maguire DCJ on 12 May 2001 following his pleas of guilty to four offences of robbery in company. One further offence of the same kind was taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to the first count on the indictment. 
      
       
     2 The sentencing order was framed in the following way:  
      
       
        
         
         ""A. Count 1 - imprisonment for a term of six years and six months to date from 9 March 1999 expiring on 8 September 2005 with a non-parole period of three years and three months. B. Counts 2, 3 and 4 - imprisonment in relation to each for a fixed term of three years and three months to date from 9 March 1999 and to expire on 8 June 2002."" 
          
         
        
       
     3 His Honour specified that he had imposed fixed terms for counts 2, 3 and 4, having regard to the nature of the sentence imposed for count 1. All sentences were to be served concurrently. 
      
       
       FACTS 
       
     4 His Honour expressly adopted the statement of facts which had been prepared in relation to the five offences, each of which involved a robbery in company of console operators working at service stations in the northern districts of Sydney. Since there is no suggestion that his Honour erred in relying upon this document when assessing the objective criminality of the applicant, I will simply adopt it as a sufficient statement of the circumstances in which the offences occurred. 
      
       
     5 That statement of facts discloses:  
      
       
        
         
         ""Robbery of Caltex Normanhurst on 9 March 1999. 
          
         At approximately 4 am on 9 March 1999 Naser Ghaderi and Amir Vojdani entered the Caltex Service Station, Pennant Hills Road, Normanhurst. Once inside the service station area the prisoners selected a packet of chips from the display. They then approached the console area where one produced a silver bladed knife, at that time the blade had not been unfolded. The operator, Durga Gutta, fearing for his safety, was pushed to the floor behind the counter by the prisoners. Ghaderi demanded that the till be opened and Mr Gutta reached towards the till, releasing it. The prisoners then removed the money from the till. 
          
           
          
         Mr Gutta was then taken into the office where the two prisoners were joined by the prisoner Wahidullah Ibrahim-Khel, who was armed with a block splitter. Ibrahim-Khel proceeded to smash the video surveillance cassette recorder with the block splitter. The video cassette recorder was then placed into a Glad garbage bag that the prisoners had brought with them.  
          
          
         On viewing a freestanding floor safe, the prisoners demanded that Mr Gutta open it, however he was unable to do so. The prisoners then placed the safe on a trolley and wheeled it from the office, before taking it out of the service station. The prisoner Ibrahim-Khel remained in the office, smashing various items with the block splitter. Using electrical cords and computer cables, the prisoner tied the hands of Mr Gutta behind his back, before leaving the store. 
          
          
         The prisoners left the service station and went to a white coloured Nissan Pulsar hatchback, registration UZT 829, that was parked by the prisoner Adris Zabul, who was also waiting in the vehicle. The prisoners placed a plastic garbage bag containing a quantity of cigarettes, taken from the service station, into the boot of the car, together with the video cassette recorder, also stolen from the store. The block splitter was placed on the floor in the rear of the car, and the floor safe was placed on the rear seat. The four prisoners then decamped from the area. 
          
          
         As a result of a number of armed robberies within the Ku-ring-gai local area, a police taskforce had been formed to investigate these matters. On 9 March 1999 officers from this taskforce were performing mobile surveillance duties in the vicinity of Pennant Hills Road, Thornleigh. 
          
          
         Some time after 4 am vehicle UZT 829 was observed by police and pursued along Beecroft Road, where it was stopped as it neared Epping. The occupants were arrested and the prisoner Adris Zabul was identified as driving the vehicle, the prisoner Ibrahim-Khel was in the front passenger seat, while the prisoners Ghaderi and Vojdani were in the rear of the car. 
          
          
         The vehicle was searched by police in the presence of the prisoners, and the following property of the service station was located: the surveillance video recorder; the surveillance video cassette; 28 cartons of cigarettes; seven packets of tobacco; six packs of matches; an amount of cash totalling $377.55 and the floor safe. 
          
          
         Police also located in the vehicle the block splitter, together with the silver bladed knife and a packet of Glad garbage bags similar to those used in carrying the property from the service station. 
          
          
         During the robbery Mr Gutta stated that he was fearful that the prisoners would hit him, because of the threats that they made towards him and would suffer injuries as a result. 
          
          
         Robbery of BP Express, Merrylands on 5 March 1999. 
          
          
         On 5 March 1999 the BP service station, Sherwood Road, Merrylands was the subject of a robbery. At about 4 am two males entered the service station shop and asked for hot food. When the operator, Peter Lenardon, turned his back he was grabbed from behind and pushed towards the storeroom. The men proceeded to ask for the money and demanded that the register be opened. A threat was made that Mr Lenardon would be stabbed if he did not comply. 
          
          
         At this point a third male, the prisoner Ibrahim-Khel, entered the store carrying a block splitter, another said they had a shotgun. Mr Lenardon opened the till as requested and was pushed into a storeroom. Ibrahim-Khel said, 'Where is the video?' and he was told that it was locked in the office. Two of them then began to fill garbage bags with cigarettes from the shelves in the storeroom, while the third was heard banging with the block splitter. The men also filled their pockets with money found in the till in the storeroom. While this was occurring, Mr Lenardon was told to remain in the corner of the storeroom. 
          
          
         The men decamped and the attendant called police and then rang his employer at 4.30 am. At the same time as the robbery, police in a routine patrol saw a white Nissan EXA parked in Kenyon Road adjacent to the service station. They stopped and spoke to the driver, who was lying back in the seat, and he told them he was resting before driving home to Westmead. When police returned to the service station when called by the attendant, the Nissan had gone. The vehicle, owned by Adris Zabul, was not at home when police attended a short time later. When he was later interviewed, Zabul told police that he was in the car and was driving home to Westmead from Fairfield, but after the police spoke to him in the car, he then went to a friend's place at Merrylands. The service station attendant described the three men who robbed him as follows: 
          
          
           
           5'4"", black T-shirt, long track pants, 20 years, short black wavy hair, baseball cap, medium build, olive skin, Lebanese appearance. 
            
            
           5'7"", slim, short dark hair, baseball cap, dark track pants and white T-shirt, 20, olive complexion, Lebanese. 
            
            
           6'0"", slim to medium, T-shirt, baseball cap, 20 years old and Lebanese. 
           
          
          
         Mr Lenardon later identified a photograph of Ibrahim-Khel as the robber with the axe. 
          
          
         Robbery of Caltex service station, Carlingford on 16 December 1998 
          
          
         On 16 December 1998 the Caltex service station at Carlingford was the subject of a robbery. At approximately 2 am the console operator, Mr Brian Williams, was packing the fridges in the store when he noticed the prisoner Adris Zabul and the co-offender standing outside the store. The men motioned to be let in and Mr Williams opened the door for them. As he did so, one of the men grabbed his upper arm and pulled him around, facing into the store. Zabul then grabbed him about the neck in a headlock type hold. The men forced Mr Williams to the floor before dragging him about to the console sales area. 
          
          
         One of the men then said, 'Open the fucking till, keep your head down, lift the tray'. Mr Williams did as he was told. However, there was only a small amount of cash there. The man then said, 'Where's the fucking money? Where's the fucking money? Open the safe.' He took the money from the till and Mr Williams replied, 'I'm only an employee, I can't.' The man then asked where the cigarettes were and Mr Williams told him that they were in the back storeroom. 
          
          
         The men dragged Mr Williams into the storeroom and one of the men said, 'Where are the cameras? Where's the fucking cameras?' Mr Williams replied, 'The place has just been taken over and they don't have any.' While Mr Williams was being held by one of the men, Zabul produced an orange bag from his pants, pulled his tracksuit arms over his hands and proceeded to walk along the shelves, scooping cigarette cartons into the orange bag as he walked along. The male holding Mr Williams then reached towards Mr Williams' back pocket and said, 'Give me your wallet.' Mr Williams showed him the wallet and said, 'Rob the company, don't rob me.' 
          
          
         At this point there was a conversation between the two robbers and Mr Williams was asked if the driveway was clear. Mr Williams replied, 'The paper man and the milko will be here, they're running late.' With that, the man holding Mr Williams threw him on the ground and slammed his foot onto his back, which winded him. He said, 'Stay there and you won't get hurt.' 
          
          
         Mr Williams heard the front door open and got off the floor and ran from the store. He noticed the men drive from the service station in a small red car, which he described to police as the same size as a three door Barina, about five to ten years old, with number plates which looked like TYY 389 or TVY 389. 
          
          
         Police inquiries revealed that Adris Zabul was the owner of a small red Daihatsu registration TYV 389. Further to this Zabul reported his vehicle stolen to police at 2.55 pm on 16 December 1998, stating that it was stolen between the hours of 12.30 am and 1 pm on that day. 
          
          
         Mr Williams gave the following description of the men involved in the robbery: 
          
          
           
           Male one: Middle Eastern appearance; early to mid twenties, wearing light blue track suit top, dark track suit pants; Nike runners, dark coloured baseball cap - peak over his eyes. Height 6 ft; stocky build. 
            
            
           Other male: Middle Eastern; early to mid twenties; 5 ft 11; stocky build - heavier than the other. Wearing black track suit; white T-shirt; gold necklace and Nike runners. 
           
          
          
         On 23 March 1999 Mr Williams viewed an identification video and identified the prisoner Zabul as being a person involved in the robbery on 16 December 1998. 
          
          
         Robbery of Ampol service station, Dural on 14 December 1998. 
          
          
         On 14 December 1998 the Ampol service station, Dural was the subject of a robbery. At about 2 am the console operator, Mr Michael Avery, was on duty when he noticed a man standing near the hot dog machine. Mr Avery went to speak to the man when he was pushed in the chest, and told to go to the cash register. The man then grabbed him on the right upper arm and pushed him behind the console area. At this point Mr Avery noticed a second man, the prisoner Zabul, enter the store. 
          
          
         The man holding Mr Avery said to him, 'Open the register or I will kill you.' Mr Avery complied and the man took the money from the drawer. While this was happening Zabul came around the counter and kept saying, 'If you fuck with me, I'll kill you.' The other male asked if there was any more cash and when Mr Avery replied no, stated, 'If you're lying to me, I'm going to kill you.' He then demanded that Mr Avery open the other drawers around the console. 
          
          
         Mr Avery was then asked where the cigarettes were kept and he replied that they were kept out the back in the storeroom. He was then taken out to the storeroom and as he was pushed through the door, he noticed that the prisoner Zabul was holding a knife. He said to Mr Avery, 'If you don't do what we say, we will kill you.' Both men then proceeded to unload cigarette cartons from the cabinet into a green plastic garbage bag with yellow drawstrings. Whilst the prisoner Zabul was packing the cigarettes, he passed the knife to the co-offender, who was still holding Mr Avery. This man then told Mr Avery to get on the floor. 
          
          
         At this stage a customer entered the store and Mr Avery was told to go and serve them and not to do anything stupid or they would kill him. Mr Avery went out and served the customer who wanted to purchase petrol and required the pump to be activated. The co-offender then gestured for Mr Avery to return to the back room. When he returned the male asked where the video surveillance equipment was. Mr Avery replied that it was in the office and he was told to get the video from the video player. Again, another customer entered the store and Mr Avery was told to serve them. As he returned to the storeroom he heard them ripping out the video player, and when he arrived he saw it lying on the floor. Mr Avery was then told to wait under the table in the office until the men left the store. After about twenty seconds Mr Avery activated the alarm button and called the police. 
          
          
         Mr Avery was able to give the following description of the two men: 
          
          
           
           First male: about 19-22 years old; taller - 5'9""; skinny/athletic build; face was thin, nose quite long and pointy, some acne scars, short hair, Mediterranean appearance. Wearing white baseball type cap; cream/grey shorts cut above the knee and a plain shirt - darker than the shorts. 
           
          
          
           
           Second male: about 23-25, older than the tall guy; shorter, stockier - 5'7"", bigger, stockier build; face fattish; short black hair; goatee with a moustache; rest of face clean shaven; Mediterranean appearance. Wearing track suit pants with three white strips down the side, long sleeve dark grey shirt, almost black, pocket on left side of chest. Both ears pierced with thick silver sleepers. 
           
          
          
         After Mr Zabul's arrest on 9 March 1999 police executed a search warrant on the prisoner's residence. During the course of the search a scrunched up video tape was found under the prisoner's bed. The tape was respooled and was revealed to be the video surveillance tape taken from the Ampol service station, Dural on 14 December 1998. 
          
          
         Robbery of Ampol service station, Chatswood on 22 February 1999. 
          
          
         On 22 February 1999 the Ampol service station, Chatswood, was the subject of a robbery. At approximately 5 am the console operator, Mr Ismail Patel, was on duty in the store and stocking the magazine racks when he was grabbed from behind and pulled towards the storeroom. As he was pulled, Mr Patel felt something hard press against his right hand side. Mr Patel began to struggle. However he stopped when he saw three other men walk into the store. As he was struggling the man holding him was yelling, 'Don't move or I'm going to kill you. I've got a pistol.' 
          
          
         Mr Patel was then dragged into the storeroom and the man holding him told him to sit down. The other three men then entered the storeroom and one of them asked Mr Patel how to open the till. When he replied that he did not know the man stated, 'Don't be silly, otherwise I will kill you.' He then leant forward and punched Mr Patel with his fist and took the glasses that he was wearing. The man again asked Mr Patel how to open the till stating that, 'otherwise we'll hit you'. Mr Patel then gave instructions on how to open the till. 
          
          
         One of the men then left the storeroom and moved into the service area of the store. When he returned Mr Patel observed that he had money in his hand. One of the men then asked whether the door from the storeroom led to the security system and Mr Patel replied, 'Yes'. He was then asked where the garbage bags were kept and told, 'Show me or else I'll kill you', by one of the men. Mr Patel was also asked where the video was, however he replied he did not know. 
          
          
         At this point the man who had hold of Mr Patel let go and then three of the men commenced hitting the door with their shoulders until the door broke open. While this was occurring, a customer pulled into the outside area of the service station and the men allowed Mr Patel to activate the petrol dispenser for the customer. The customer then entered the store and Mr Patel served him. Three of the men waited in the storeroom while the fourth stood near the counter, however he was far enough away for Mr Patel to tell the customer, Mr Damien Macey, that he was being robbed. The customer replied that he would get the police and left the store. 
          
          
         Another customer then entered the store and asked for the balance on his card to be checked. While this was occurring the three men in the storeroom came into the main store area, all were carrying garbage bags which were full. The four men then left the store and Mr Patel activated the store alarm. Along with the cash that was taken from the store, was a large quantity of cigarettes and the videotape from the security video. 
          
          
         Mr Patel gave the following description of the men responsible for the robbery: 
          
          
           
           Male 20 to 25 years, 6'0"", thin build, black curly, short hair, Middle Eastern, wearing black trousers and dark blue shirt. 
            
            
           The one in charge as: 25 years, medium to large build, 5'6"" tall, black short hair, Middle Eastern, black trousers, white T-shirt. 
            
            
           Two other males about 25 years, about 5'10"" tall, black short hair, black trousers. 
           
          
          
         The customer, Damien Macey, described the men he saw at the service station as: 
          
          
           
           6'0"" tall, solid build, Adidas type track suit, Mediterranean, short black curly hair, clean shaven. 
           
          
          
           
           Shorter, wearing black oversized trousers, light hair, less Mediterranean, both 18 to 22 old. 
           
          
          
         On 29 March 1999 Mr Macey viewed an identification video and identified a photograph of the prisoner Adris Zabul as a person in the store on 22 February 1999."" 
         
        
       
     6 The criminality of the applicant, it may be observed, spanned a period between 14 December 1998 and 9 March 1999. When sentencing the applicant his Honour also dealt with Naser Ghaderi and Wahidullah Ibrahim-Khel, who had respectively pleaded guilty to four counts of robbery in company on an indictment, and one count on a Form 1; and five counts of robbery in company on an indictment and two offences on a Form 1. 
      
       
     7 The offences to which the other offenders pleaded guilty were the same kind as those committed by the applicant, but only one of them was committed by Ghaderi in company with the applicant and only two were committed by Ibrahim-Khel in company with him. 
      
       
     8 The effective overall sentencing order for each offender was the same. That circumstance gives rise to the sole ground of appeal - namely that there was a disparity in sentencing such as to engender a legitimate sense of grievance in the applicant.  
      
       
     9 Otherwise it is clear that his Honour in a carefully considered and very thorough statement of reasons: 
      
       
        (a) properly weighed the objective criminality involved in offences of the kind here involved, as well as the need for a significant element of general deterrence in accordance with the principles enunciated by this Court in decisions such as  
       Regina v Thwaites 
        (Unreported, NSWCCA 9 October 1993); 
        
        (b) gave proper credit for the pleas of guilty and contrition expressed by the applicant; 
        
        (c) carefully and fairly weighed his subjective circumstances and his prospects of rehabilitation; 
        
        (d) properly found special circumstances to exist, which were then reflected in the adjustment of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence; and 
        
        (e) appropriately reflected the totality of the criminality taken into account in relation to the first count in accordance with the decision of this Court in  
       Regina v Morgan 
        (1993) 70 ACrimR 368. 
        
       
     10 Standing alone there could be no possible argument to the effect that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were outside the proper range of sentencing discretion available for offences each of which carried a potential maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. Those offences were particularly serious and they were potentially very frightening for the victims. 
      
       
     11 While in the case of each offender the offences were committed in order to feed a drug habit, this provides no excuse whatsoever for what occurred. His Honour appropriately remarked in this respect: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The needs of drug users which they satisfy by preying on shop assistants are of little interest to the victims. Their lives are so often seriously affected by their terrifying experiences. Those who seek to earn a modest income by manning service stations and like facilities at night are entitled to think that judges will act responsibly when dealing with those who terrify and rob them. They have a real interest in the operation of the criminal justice system and its treatment of those who rob service stations and as to whether they are to be protected by deterrent sentences. The community generally has a legitimate expectation that sentences will be imposed which will act as a deterrent to other would-be robbers."" 
          
         
        
       
     12 With those remarks, I would express my wholehearted agreement. As I have observed, the sole question alive is that of parity.  
      
       
     13 In that regard it may be first noted that his Honour expressly found that there was ""no significant difference in the criminality"" of the three young men standing for sentence. 
      
       
     14 The parity argument advanced by the applicant, in substance, involves the following propositions, which, it was submitted, leave the applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance: 
      
       
        
         
         ""A. He was dealt with for five offences while Ibrahim-Khel was dealt with for six offences and Ghaderi faced sentence for seven offences; 
          
          
         B. He had no prior criminal record, whereas Ibrahim-Khel, who was said to have a record of no great significance, was on a three year bond for a series of driving offences including an offence of high range PCA; and Ghaderi also had a criminal history, although it similarly was assessed to be 'minor and of no real significance to the sentencing exercise'; 
          
          
         C. At the time of sentencing the applicant was aged twenty-one years, Ibrahim-Khel was aged twenty four and Ghaderi was aged twenty; 
          
          
         D. Subjectively, each of the applicant and Ibrahim-Khel had been born in Afghanistan and had drug dependencies which they had begun to address, while Ghaderi had similarly come to Australia as a refugee and had a problem with heroin."" 
         
        
       
       
     15 The relevant question for consideration is whether, when comparing the sentence of the applicant with the sentences of his two co-offenders, the applicant could be properly left with a ""justifiable sense of grievance"", as that expression has been explained in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295. 
      
       
     16 As Sully J, with whom Newman J agreed, said in Regina v Doggett (Unreported NSWCCA 24 March 1997), in order to succeed on appeal: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""what has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened, would see that the offender's grievance is justified"". 
         
        
       
       
     17 That sense of grievance, it was submitted would be evident to a reasonable mind looking at what had occurred, once it was appreciated that: 
      
       
        A. Ibrahim-Khel was older than the applicant, had committed six offences and was on a bond, a circumstance recognised as an aggravating factor (see  
       Regina v Readman 
        (1990) 47 ACrimR 181); 
        
        B. While Ghaderi was younger, he was being dealt with for two more offences than the applicant and he did not have a clean criminal record. 
        
       
     18 Despite the cogent and careful submissions of Mr Button of counsel for the applicant, I am not persuaded that this submission has been made good. In Regina v Hoole (Unreported NSWCCA 17 March 1998), Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""Where two or more offenders are sentenced in relation to multiple offences (whether by the same or different judges) and where they are co-offenders in relation to some but not to all of the multiple offences for which each was sentenced, there is little if any value in attempting to compare the individual sentences imposed upon the different offenders in relation to the same offence."" 
         
        
       
       
     19 Mr Button sought to distinguish that proposition by reference to the fact that his Honour was directing his attention particularly to individual sentences with the consequence, so it was submitted, that the proposition was of limited, if of any value, where there were a series of offences being dealt with upon a totality basis. There is some force in that submission, however, it is not to my mind persuasive. 
      
       
     20 The same proposition does apply, to my mind, where there are a series of different offences, and where the offenders involved fulfilled different roles in relation to each of them. In a case such as the present, where there was a multiplicity of offences, with each offender performing a different role, it would involve a somewhat pointless, if not hypothetical exercise to attempt a weighing process in relation to their individual culpability for each offence. 
      
       
     21 At the end of the day, what a sentencing judge must do is to regard the matter in a global way, taking into account the objective and subjective circumstances present, and come to a conclusion in relation to the criminality of the individual offences involved. 
      
       
     22 In the present case I am satisfied that this is precisely what his Honour did and it was that to which his Honour referred when observing that the criminality of the individual offender was of a similar degree. 
      
       
     23 Moreover, in my view, when offenders are involved in a series of offences of this type, there is not necessarily any significant difference objectively between the position of an offender who carried out five such offences and one who committed, for example, eight such offences. What was more material, in my view, was the fact that the applicant offended over a longer period, that is, between 14 December 1998 and 9 March 1999, while Ibrahim-Khel's offences were confined to a period of approximately one month, between 4 February 1999 and 9 March 1999; and those of Ghaderi were confined to a period of six weeks, between 24 January 1999 and 9 March 1999. 
      
       
     24 The one matter which I accept does call for closer reflection is the fact Ibrahim-Khel was subject to a bond and did have a worse record than the applicant. That clearly was a difference of importance which would have been of considerable significance had the offences for which it had been imposed been of the same genus as those for which he and the applicant stood for sentence before his Honour. 
      
       
     25 A counterbalancing consideration in this case, it seems to me, is the circumstance that the applicant had a personal experience of being the victim of an armed robbery, which he acknowledged had been an occasion of great trauma for him. To deliberately offend against others in a similar way, after having had this experience and within a matter of days of it, was quite inexcusable and a circumstance which, in my view, disentitled him to much in the way of leniency. 
      
       
     26 At the end of the day, I am of the view that to intervene in this case would result in a sentence that would be manifestly lenient, and one that would not be reflective of the significantly serious objective circumstances involved. In that regard, counsel did accept that to intervene would produce a lenient sentence, although he argued not one which would be manifestly lenient. That was a fair concession on his part. However, I think it understates the consequence of intervention. 
      
       
     27 In this regard it is accepted that the doctrine of parity is not to be applied so as to require the imposition of an inadequate sentence (see Regina v Pritchard and McDonald (Unreported NSWCCA 22 April 1993). In Regina v Steele (Unreported NSWCCA 17 April 1997) Simpson J, in declining to reduce a sentence by reason of parity said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""The frequently cited passage from the judgment of Mason J ( 
         Lowe 
         ) is not authority for the proposition that, in any case where such disparity is shown, a Court of Criminal Appeal must reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate. It is authority for the proposition that, in an appropriate case, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the existence of a justifiable sense of grievance in the more heavily sentenced co-offender, the appellate court has a discretion to do so."" 
          
          
         
        
       
     28 Although I am not convinced the applicant is entitled to entertain a sense of grievance of any great magnitude, quite independently of that conclusion, I am satisfied that an application of this principle is decisive. To reduce the sentences here imposed would be an affront to justice, particularly having regard to matters discussed in the guideline judgment in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
      
       
     29 I would accordingly grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     30 GROVE J: I agree. 
      
       
     31 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I propose.

       REGINA v DAVID JOHN PERRIN 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon the applicant by Sorby DCJ in the Parramatta District Court. The applicant had appeared in that Court charged with two offences of armed robbery and his Honour sentenced him on the first count to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years, and on the second count, to imprisonment for four years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and six months. Both sentences were ordered to commence upon the same date and therefore were to the extent of the first imposition, concurrent. 
     2 This application, thanks to the co-operation of counsel, can be dealt with relatively expeditiously. 
     3 The facts of the matter are that the applicant was then a nineteen-year-old young man who had apparently been viewing videos, in the course of which he developed an idea of committing a robbery. I remain mystified as to how that thought sprang into his mind. However, in the afternoon of Wednesday, 20 September 2000, he left his premises, riding his brother's bicycle. He was wearing a black coloured back pack and had taken with him a kitchen knife. 
     4 I do not need to specify all of the events which occurred, but in short, he went to a Blockbuster video store where he exposed the handle of the knife, as a result of which staff opened the tills and gave him approximately $330. 
     5 At about 6 am the following morning, again riding his brother's bicycle, there was almost a repeat of what had occurred on the previous afternoon, although on this occasion the target was a McDonalds hamburger store. 
     6 The applicant sought to flee the scene of this crime, but was chased by members of the staff, including one in a motor car. As a result of a collision, his brother's bicycle was damaged and he was forced to continue his flight on foot. Coincidentally, he encountered a police officer, but was able to persuade this police officer he was visiting a friend and he was on this occasion not arrested. 
     7 However, it is obvious information was pointing towards him and a search warrant was executed. On Sunday morning, the applicant no doubt having heard the police had an interest in him, presented himself at the Parramatta Police Station. He was interviewed by detectives, and made a full confession in relation to both matters. He pleaded guilty when charged. That plea was maintained when he appeared before the District Court. 
     8 The learned sentencing judge, as is obvious from the sentences which I have specified, found that there were special circumstances justifying a departure from the proportion of non-parole period to the head sentence specified in the statute. 
     9 One matter which has been canvassed in the course of this appeal relates to his Honour's remarks concerning the application of the guidelines set down in the case of Regina v Henry. His Honour expressed himself as intending to sentence the applicant in accordance with guidelines set down therein. He also said that he found that the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent because of his plea. 
     10 It needs to be observed that in Regina v Thompson, the Chief Justice expressly observed that the Court had been asked to clarify its earlier guideline judgments, in particular including the case of Regina v Henry. An important observation for present purposes is that his Honour affirmed that in the case of Henry the Court was concerned with a guilty plea of limited value. In the present case the plea was as early as one could imagine is possible. 
     11 It seems to me therefore that the application by his Honour of a discount, which would be appropriate simply to the utilitarian value of the plea, would seem not in all the circumstances to have been sufficient for this particular case. In my view the jurisdiction of this Court is enlivened, and we should proceed to re-sentence. 
     12 I have already observed that the applicant was but nineteen years of age at the time of the offence, and he has only just turned twenty. He has no prior convictions. I have already observed that the circumstances of the offence, although no doubt frightening, even terrifying, for the victims, were somewhat peculiar. The learned sentencing judge observed that there had been a degree of planning, but for my part it is difficult to identify exactly what planning had occurred. 
     13 It is true, as the Crown Prosecutor has pointed out, that there was evidence that the applicant had contemplated the matter apparently over a period of weeks, but contemplation and planning are not in my vocabulary synonymous words. 
     14 The applicant is entitled, in my view, to considerable favourable weight to be given to his early confession in this matter. As the Court is proceeding to re-sentence, we can also take into account material in an affidavit by the applicant sworn on the fourth of this month. That shows that the applicant is performing very well in gaol, and I observe his statement that he never wants to return again to gaol after he is released from this sentence. His prospects of rehabilitation would seem to be every bit as good as his Honour hoped for, and his progress to date would indicate that it is likely to be achieved. 
     15 It was said in the Court below - and I have no reason to doubt it - that the applicant had got into financial difficulties as a result of gambling. He had, however, associated himself with Gamblers Anonymous, and it appears he has insight into his problem and it has helped considerably to overcome that, showing the enthusiasm for rehabilitation that he expressed in the affidavit. 
     16 I would propose therefore that the Court make the following orders: The application for leave to appeal be granted, the appeal allowed, the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed, and in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced as follows: On the first count to imprisonment for one year and nine months to commence on 6 February 2001 and to expire on 5 November 2002. I would not set a non-parole period in respect of that sentence, having regard to the following sentence to be imposed in respect of the second count. 
     17 On the second count I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for three years and six months, to commence on 6 February 2001 but I would specify a non-parole period of one year and nine months, to commence on 6 February 2001 and to expire on 5 November 2002. The applicant would therefore be eligible for release to parole from 5 November 2002. 
     18 HOWIE J: I agree. The discount that the applicant was entitled to was perhaps even more than 25 per cent, as specified by the sentencing judge, having regard to the fact that he voluntarily went to the police station and confessed his guilt. Even though this may not be a case where the confession was of a type that he would not have been discovered by the police, nevertheless it was a matter to which the applicant was entitled to receive an additional discount, other than the plea of guilty before the Magistrate. 
     19 This is a matter, of course, like all of these appeals being dealt with by a two-person Bench, which is determined on its own facts and circumstances, and it does not indicate at all what might be the appropriate sentence in other facts and circumstances. 
     20 GROVE J: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v LUKE AIKEN 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Job DCJ in the Gosford District Court on 6 July 2000. On that occasion the applicant appeared and was convicted on one count of supplying a prohibited drug, in this instance methylamphetamine, and there was taken into account on a form 1 a charge of possessing cannabis.2 The applicant was sentenced to two years imprisonment to date from 30 June 2000, and a non parole period of eighteen months was set. The applicant was ordered to be released to parole on 29 December 2001. He appeared for himself in this application. 
     3 A written submission sent in response to the Registrar's direction stated that the applicant had been advised he was not actually appealing on the severity of the sentence but was seeking a back dating of his sentence to 19 May 2000, which was the date he was taken into custody. 
     4 As has been pointed out by the Crown, and pointed out to the applicant in the course of the hearing today, the applicant was indeed taken into custody on or about 19 May but he appeared in the Wyong Local Court on 30 June 2000 when, for a number of offences not the subject of the current appeal, he was sentenced to a fixed term of six months to date from 18 May 2000. It might also be observed he re-appeared in the Wyong Local Court on 20 June in respect of other charges and he was sentenced to two months imprisonment to date from 20 May 2000. 
     5 Accordingly, it may be seen that Job DCJ ordered the current sentence now the subject of challenge to commence on 30 June 2000 when the applicant still had outstanding to be served approximately four and a half months of the longer sentence imposed in the District Court, and approximately five or six weeks of the shorter sentence. To that extent he has already had the benefit of serving sentences concurrently. 
     6 In my opinion, the applicant's challenge insofar as it is based upon a failure to back date the current sentence to the first occasion on which he was taken into custody is doomed to failure. 
     7 The applicant has pointed out that one effect of the current sentence is that he will be released shortly after Christmas and it was hoped that he could help and be with his wife and four young children during that time. That circumstance undoubtedly provokes sympathy, but it must be pointed out that these matters were put before the sentencing Judge and he expressed himself to be aware of those circumstances. Indeed, the applicant's de facto wife Kellie Joan Clark gave significant evidence in the sentencing proceedings. 
     8 It has been pointed out to the applicant that the jurisdiction of this court can only be invoked where error has been demonstrated in the proceedings the subject of challenge by way of appeal. No such error has been demonstrated. In these circumstances I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     9 HOWIE J: I agree. 
     10 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

       REGINA v RUSSELL SABELGUNST 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Sides in the District Court at Campbelltown. The applicant appeared upon indictment charging four separate offences. In short his Honour imposed concurrent sentences of 18 months fixed terms in respect of charges of breaking, entering and stealing, taking and driving a conveyance and malicious damage by fire. The first count in the indictment, which was manifestly the most serious charged, was robbery, and on that offence the learned judge imposed a sentence of 5 years imprisonment cumulative upon the fixed term which I have mentioned and he set a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months, thus rendering the applicant eligible for parole from the earliest date at 27 May 2004. 
     2 The applicant has represented himself before this Court. It was indicated to him, and I confirm, that if the Court was minded to grant him leave to appeal against sentence then any necessary extension of time would be granted. In response to the Registrar's direction the applicant has set out a number of matters in a letter dated 3 September 2001. It is appropriate to move to those matters without recapitulating the facts of the offences which are adequately set out in the remarks on sentence by the learned judge in the District Court. It should be observed in passing that on the third count of the indictment some 12 further offences were taken into account on a schedule. All of the matters which are set out in the letter of submissions received from the applicant relate to matters which were known at the time of sentence. These can be summarised by noting that the applicant has referred to the circumstances that his natural father left his mother before he was born and that he was raised in a dysfunctional family. He has explained that he was, himself, sexually abused at the age of 14 and commenced to use drugs at a young age. He said: ""I ended up with a habit and needing drugs to feel normal in my life and it became out of control and I couldn't keep a job and money became a problem so I had to break the law by stealing to get money to feel normal."" 
     3 The applicant has, before this Court today, repeated orally the assurance contained in his letter that he is anxious to have a chance to demonstrate to others that he can lead a law-abiding life. It is apparent from the content of that letter and the applicant's remarks today that he does not possess a full appreciation of the nature and jurisdiction of this Court, which is what is described as a court of error in distinction from being a court of review. It is not open to this Court simply to reassess matters which were available to be considered at first instance and substitute any sentence which this court might feel it would have imposed in substitution for that already indicated in the District Court. 
     4 There is no error detectable in the proceedings below. There are a number of other matters adverted to by the applicant including an assertion that he has been bashed and almost raped whilst in gaol. He is only 20 years of age. It is not open to this Court to investigate matters subsequent to sentence for the purposes of detecting asserted error below. Those sorts of matters can be looked at but only if there is some basis upon which this court should proceed to resentence. 
     5 The applicant appears today as a young man of sincerity. It is to be hoped that he is able to fulfil the assurance which he has offered to the Court. Regrettably, however, as I have said, it is necessary for there to be circumstances which lawfully trigger the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court and an examination of the papers reveals none to my mind. 
     6 In those circumstances I would grant an extension of time for leave to appeal, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     7 HOWIE J: The sentence imposed upon the applicant no doubt appears to him to be a lengthy one in light of his young age and the fact that he will have to serve until 27 May 2004 before becoming eligible for parole. However, as the presiding judge indicated there is no error at all apparent in the remarks of the sentencing judge and in my view the sentence imposed, in light of the seriousness of the criminal conduct of the applicant, was well within the sentencing judge's discretion. In those circumstances, whilst one feels some sympathy for the applicant looking at such a long sentence at such a young age and with his background it is quite impossible for this court to interfere in any way with the sentence imposed. Therefore, I agree with the orders of the presiding judge. 
     8 GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be, therefore, as I have proposed.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL60457/01Mason PLevine JHowie J 
     Monday 8 October 2001REGINA v Maurice William BLYTHJudgment1 Mason P: I agree with Levine J. 2 Levine J: The appellant was tried in the District Court before Judge Nield and a jury and convicted of the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely, 3, 4 Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA - ""ecstasy""), being an amount not less than the commercial quantity for such drug; see s 24(2) Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 which provides a maximum penalty of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole of 2 yeas and six months. He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 3 There are two grounds of appeal: that his Honour erred in not directing a verdict of not guilty; alternatively, that the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice. (No complaint is made as to the trial judge's summing up to the jury). More specifically, it is contended, that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty because: (a) there was no or no sufficient evidence of manufacture of the specific prohibited substance; (b) there was no or no sufficient evidence of the appellant's knowing participation in the manufacture of any prohibited substance; and, (c) there was no or no sufficient evidence of the appellant's intention to manufacture not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA. 4 As to the structure of the trial, the evidence which went to the jury was only that called in the Crown case. It fairly can be remarked that that evidence overall was not challenged though its import or significance, in the light of the grounds of appeal before this Court, was. 5 Very briefly as to the facts: the execution of a search warrant on 22 February 1999 at premises at Waterloo, which the evidence disclosed the accused had said were ""his place"", revealed the existence of a clandestine laboratory. Its paraphernalia, spread widely over the premises, is described in detail in the evidence, particularly of Detective Clarke and Mr Judd, a Forensic Chemist. The latter noticed upon his examination of the premises a smell of safrole. Additionally a search of the vehicle being driven by the appellant (there is no evidence that the appellant was the registered owner of that vehicle), revealed two glass jars containing safrole. A fingerprint of the appellant was developed on the base of a glass vessel and in respect of two other fingerprints Detective Kirby was reasonably certain that they were, but could not positively identify them as, the fingerprints of the appellant. Traces of bromo-safrole were found on the appellant's jeans and running shoes. I interpolate that evidence in relation to the jeans and running shoes as exhibits being packed together and thus leading to a chance of cross-contamination from the shoes to the jeans around the pockets of which traces of the relevant substance were found in any event, could not in the end realistically, assist the appellant. It was open to the jury to reject any innocent explanation because of the proliferation of paraphernalia and the substances in fact found in the premises described by the appellant as ""his"" and in the vehicle he was driving. The same observation can be made as to the attempt to gain some comfort from the strength of ""fumes"" within the premises accounting in some way for the material in fact located on the appellant's clothing. 6 Mr Ballard, a Forensic Chemist, gave evidence as to the method of manufacture of MDMA in two steps as applicable in the circumstances of this trial: the conversion of safrole to bromo-safrole and then the reaction of bromo-safrole with methylamine to produce MDMA. All necessary apparatus for the process of MDMA was present. Traces of MDMA were found at the premises. Although no methylamine was found, it was the evidence of Mr Ballard that he was satisfied that that component must have been used somewhere and at sometime in the premises given the existence of the traces of the final product, MDMA. 7 As to the first ground of appeal, the learned trial judge approached the application for a not guilty verdict by appropriately cataloguing the elements of the offence:  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""1. The accused did something knowingly. 
            
            
           2. The thing that the accused did knowingly was to take part in something. 
            
            
           3. The thing in which the accused took part was the manufacture of something. 
            
            
           4. The thing that was manufactured was a particular prohibited drug, namely, 3-4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or MDMA. 
            
            
           5. The amount of the prohibited drug that was manufactured was not less than, that is, equal to or more than, the commercial quantity for that drug which is 125 grams"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     8 His Honour thereupon considered the evidence with respect to each element and came to the conclusion under challenge. 9 It is first contended that there was no or no sufficient evidence of manufacture of the specific substance. His Honour dealt with this as follows:  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           """"Thirdly, manufacture. The following evidence shows beyond argument that a manufacturing process was being conducted on the premises to manufacture Bromo-safrole (BS) by reaction between safrole and hydrobromic acid:  
           
          
         
        
       
     1. The smell of safrole about the premises. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     2. The sound of the fan from the bedroom in which the manufacturing process was being conducted. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     3. The apparatus within which the chemical reaction was taking place within this bedroom. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     4. The apparatus about the premises generally. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     5. The quantity of chemicals about the premises generally. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     6. The safety equipment, the breathing mask and the goggles, on the premises. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     7. The apparatus containing traces of, inter alia, MDMA found in the bedroom in which the chemical reaction was taking place. 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
           8. The container containing, inter alia, MDMA in the roof space adjacent to the accused's bedroom. 
            
           As the Crown Prosecutor said, the accused would have had to be blind and deaf and without any sense of smell to be unaware of what was happening on the premises"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     10 I agree with his Honour's analysis of the evidence and would add that the presence of traces of MDMA was of special significance. 11 It was next contended that there was no evidence of the appellant's knowing participation in the manufacture. 12 What his Honour said on this element was as follows:  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""Firstly, knowingly. The evidence must show beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knowingly did something in the manufacture of something. To do something knowingly is to do the thing intentionally or deliberately with appreciation or awareness of the purpose for which the thing was done. The evidence does not prove directly what the accused knew about what he did in relation to the manufacturing process. But the evidence proves directly that he intentionally or deliberately did some things in relation to the manufacturing process, namely, he was living in premises in which a clandestine laboratory was operating, his fingerprints were found on two jars containing Safrole, his fingerprints were on one of the two glass vessels being used in the manufacture of Bromo-Safrole, BS, he had BS on his jeans and he had Safrole and BS on his shoes. In my view this evidence is capable of showing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had knowingly done something in relation to the manufacturing process"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     13 Furthermore, in this context, it was contended that there was no or no sufficient evidence of the accused's knowing ""participation"" in the manufacture of any prohibited substance. 14 His Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""All that is required is that the evidence be capable of showing beyond reasonable doubt that he: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     A. Took part in any step in that process or: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
     B. Provided the premises in which any such step in that process was taken or: 
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
           C. As the occupier of the premises, if that is what he was, suffered or permitted any such step in that process to be taken. 
            
           In my view, the following facts are capable of showing that the accused took a step in the manufacturing process. His fingerprints were found on two jars containing Safrole, his fingerprints were found on one of the two glass vessels being used in the manufacturing process and BS was found on his jeans and on his shoes.  
           Also, in my view, the evidence shows that the accused provided the premises on which the manufacturing process was conducted. However, in my view, the Crown cannot rely upon the accused as the occupier of the premises, if that is what he was, suffering or permitting someone else taking any step in the manufacturing process on the premises"" 
            (emphasis added). 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     15 I am of the view that the approach of his Honour reflects a proper application of principle as to ""taking part in,"" as provided by s 6(a) and (c) of the Statute and its import as stated by Gleeson CJ in Regina v Thomas (1993) ACR 308 at 310. 16 Section 6 of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 relevantly states:  
      
       
        
         
         ""For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the cultivation or supply of a prohibited plant or the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug if: 
           
          
           
           (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation, manufacture, production or supply, 
            
            
           ... 
            
           (c) the person provides the premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management of which the person participates"". 
           
          
         
        
       
     17 It is to be borne in mind in relation to s 6(c) that his Honour specifically found that the accused ""provided the premises on which the manufacturing process was conducted"". He ruled that the Crown could not rely upon the accused as the occupier of the premises or ""suffering"" or ""permitting"" someone else to take any step in the manufacture. 18 I will say no more than that the words ""providing the premises"" could be characterised as elusive in terms of their clarity of meaning once any notion of ""occupation"" or ""suffering"" is eliminated. For the purposes of the disposition of this appeal, they are not so opaque, in my view, as to render unavailable the evidence constituted, for example, at the very least, by the statement of the accused that the premises were ""his"", that the accused resided there with his defacto wife and child, and even though there was another person present. Additional evidence is constituted by the keys from the vehicle being driven by the accused and one of them being available to unlock the gates. As to ""knowingly"" I have set out above what his Honour said: the evidence to which his Honour refers clearly is capable of leading to the finding of knowledge in accordance with the test correctly stated by his Honour to the effect that knowledge in the context of ""knowingly take part in"" may be established either by proof that the accused knew or was aware of something or alternatively, had a belief, falling short of actual knowledge, or an awareness of the likelihood in the sense of the significant or real chance of something: see R v CWW (1993) 70 A Crim R 517 at 524; R v Greatorex (1994) 74 A Crim R 496 at 498; R v Karl Karam (1995) 83 A Crim R 416 at 423-424. 19 Enveloped by various contentions made in the written submissions (but not spoken to in the course of oral submissions), was the assertion that with respect to the offence of ""taking part in"" there rests upon the Crown an obligation to exclude beyond reasonable doubt the participation of others by analogy to the principles in relation to ""possession"" referred to in The Queen v Filippetti (1978) 13 A Crim R 335 at 338. All I am disposed to say on this undeveloped point is that I have great difficulty as a matter of logic and good sense in transposing to the statutory requirement as to ""taking part"" in by the accused charged with that offence the principles that have evolved in relation to exclusive physical control. Insofar as his Honour ruled that there was no such requirement on the Crown in a case such as this, his Honour was correct. 20 Finally it was submitted that there was no sufficient evidence as to quantity. His Honour said:  
      
       
        
         
          
           
           ""Lastly, not less than the commercial quantity for MDMA. It is essential that the evidence show beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to manufacture not less than the commercial quantity of 125 grams of MDMA. This is the effect of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
           CWW (1993) 
            70 ACR 517 applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
           Davey  
           CCA 3 March 1995 unreported. The accused's counsel submitted that the evidence does not show that the accused intended to manufacture MDMA not les than the commercial quantity. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
           CWW 
            does not apply to the manufacture of a prohibited drug but that, if it does, the evidence shows an intention to manufacture not less than the commercial quantity. In my view, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
           CWW 
            applies to the manufacture of a prohibited drug in an amount not les than the commercial quantity in the same way that the Court of Criminal Appeal applied it in  
           Davey 
            to the supply of a prohibited drug in an amount not less than the commercial quantity. In my view, the evidence of the total quantity of Safrole found o the premises and in the vehicle being driven by the accused and the evidence of Mr Ballard as to the minimum amount of MDMA capable of being manufactured from the total quantity of Safrole is capable of showing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's intention was to manufacture an amount of MDMA not less than the commercial quantity. 
            
           To paraphrase what was said by Sheller JA in  
           CWW 
           , intention may be proved by showing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the belief, falling short of actual knowledge, or was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that the amount of MDMA likely to be manufactured from the quantity of Safrole was equal to or more than 125 grams"". 
            
           
          
         
        
       
     21 For present purposes, contrary to the submissions for the Crown, CWW to which his Honour referred, in my view, is applicable to this offence: see Sheller JA at 524. Here there was evidence, as his Honour held correctly, to go to the jury on the issue. I add that the alternative count was left to the jury in the event of it not being persuaded beyond reasonable doubt as to this fifth element of the charge in the indictment. 22 The matters to which I have referred are the only matters relevant to the first ground of appeal in the light of the structure of the Crown case. I do not consider his Honour to have been in error either as a matter of principle or in the application of principle as to the evidence as analysed by him. 23 The first ground of appeal thus fails. 24 As to the second ground relating to an asserted miscarriage of justice this must also fail. It is inextricably bound up with the structure of the appeal in relation to the first ground. The case was essentially a circumstantial evidence case, properly left to the jury and the subject of proper directions. Upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury, in my view, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt. I note that his Honour said words to the effect in his remarks on sentence that the outcome was no surprise to him. The appeal fails on this basis. 25 The complaint about sentence is that his Honour erred in finding that the appellant was a ""principal"". His Honour was, as I understand it, in no doubt of it. His Honour's remarks on sentence are clear and well ordered and without error. What his Honour described as the overwhelming case against the appellant led him to the view he formed which was clearly open to him. Indeed, it is very difficult to isolate a basis upon which it could be asserted, as I understand it to have been asserted during the proceedings on sentence, that the appellant was engaged at a ""low level,"" whatever that might mean. Nothing that was said by the High Court in The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, where the concern was with the desirability of any notion of hierarchy and the onus and standard of proof on matters of sentence provides a basis for impugning his Honour's approach. As I have said, his Honour was satisfied beyond doubt as to the status of principal which he found the appellant to have enjoyed and I am quite satisfied that there was an abundance of evidence upon which his Honour could do so. To my mind no error has been exposed in his Honour approach to the exercise of his sentencing discretion and the finding led to the imposition of a custodial sentence well within the available range. 26 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders:  
      
       
        
       1. That the time to institute the appeal be extended to 5 July 2001. 
        
        
       2. That the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
        
        
       3. That leave to appeal against sentence be granted. 
        
        
       4. The appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
        
       
     27 Howie J: I agree with the orders proposed and reasons given by Levine J.

     070029/01 - REGINA v JUNIOR VAA MAMAE 
     
     
     SENTENCE 
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 September 2001 the offender was arraigned at this Court on a charge of murder and, in the alternative, aggravated assault with intent to rob. The offences alleged occurred at St Mary's on 15 July 2000 when Mr Pieter Hage was attacked whilst walking home in the early hours of the morning. 
     
      
    2 The offender put himself at the scene of the crime, but denied any involvement. He attributed the attack to his companion, Jason Young. That offender was sentenced by me on 3 September last in circumstances that are detailed later in these remarks. 
     
      
    3 The jury in Junior Mamae's trial was instructed that the crime of murder is committed when the act of an accused which caused the death of the deceased was done by him during or immediately after the commission by that accused or by some accomplice with him to the crime of aggravated assault with intent to rob with wounding. Before returning a verdict of guilty to murder, it was essential that the Crown prove that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the offender and Jason Young to attack Mr Hage. The jury was also instructed that an alternative verdict of manslaughter should be returned if, taken with other elements that are not relevant at the moment, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Jason Young and the accused jointly attacked Mr Hage at St Mary's on 15 July 2000 and that the assault upon Mr Hage was unlawful and dangerous. 
     
      
    4 During the trial it became clear that there was no issue that the death of the victim resulted from the attack upon him. As any verdict of guilty for the felony of murder necessarily involves consideration of the second count, it would have been too confusing for the jury to be left with the count of aggravated assault with intent to rob with wounding. Accordingly, during the course of the trial, the Court granted leave to the Crown to withdraw the second count on the indictment. 
     
      
    5 The trial concluded on 14 September when the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to murder, but guilty of manslaughter. The jury's verdict meant that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a joint attack with the intention to rob occurred, but it was satisfied to the required standard that the offender joined in the assault upon the victim. The offender was convicted and remanded in custody pending sentence. 
     
      
    6 Bearing in mind the jury's verdict and material that was not in issue, the Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the following facts and circumstances of and surrounding Mr Hage's death. 
     
      
    7 On Friday 14 July last year, Mr Pieter Isak Hage, who lived in Edgar Street, St Mary's, went to work. After work he went with a friend to an hotel and consumed some alcohol. He then went to his home. After that he went to the St Mary's Band Club. There Mr Hage had a fair bit to drink. At about some time around 11.30 on Friday evening he left the Band Club. He went to a pizza shop on the northern side of the Great Western Highway a little before midnight and bought a pizza and ate it there. He went to sleep for part of the time whilst sitting in the pizza shop. He then woke up and left about 12.10 am. 
     
      
    8 He then walked towards his home in Edgar Street and arrived at the north-western corner of Edgar Street in Mamre Road. It was there he was assaulted by the two young men, Jason Young and the offender. Jason Young punched Mr Hage several times to the head and, when Mr Hage fell to the ground, Jason Young then kicked Mr Hage several times to the lower body. The offender kicked Mr Hage several times to the upper area of his body. During the attack Mr Hage was wounded, in that he received lacerations to the eye. Mr Hage also received flap lacerations.  
     
      
    9 The Crown led evidence in support of its case that the purpose of the attack was to rob Mr Hage. The jury was not satisfied that such a joint criminal enterprise occurred and that aspect of the Crown case plays no part in the sentence. 10 After Mr Hage was assaulted, the offender and Jason Young then continued to walk in a northerly direction up Mamre Road and then to the Band Club and also to a disco by the name of Colours. 
     
      
    11 At about 12.20 am a resident of Edgar Street saw Mr Hage's body on the footpath and telephoned the local police who responded, as did the ambulance officers who were called. Mr Hage was found to be deceased. A later post-mortem revealed that he had died from the stress of the attack upon him, and particularly his diseased heart. Mr Hage did not die directly from the injuries received, but from the distress brought about by the physical attack upon him.  
     
      
    12 The injuries the victim received did not amount to grievous bodily harm. They, by themselves, did not result in serious injury. So much is clear from Dr Little's findings. The victim was an unhealthy man who was intoxicated at the time he was assaulted by the offender and Mr Young. The blows to him from the offender and Mr Young resulted in his death. 
     
      
    13 The offence of manslaughter is a serious crime since it involves the taking of human life, the protection of which is the primary objective of the criminal justice system: Regina v Veech (2001) NSWSC 68. In Blacklidge NSW CCA 12 December 1995 Gleeson CJ said at page 4: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, common manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the Courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element is the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case."" 
        
       
       
      His Honour referred to  
      Regina v Dodd 
       (1991) 57 A Crim R 349;  
      Regina v Hill 
       (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402. 
       
       
      
    14 The fact that the offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years provides a powerful indicator as to the seriousness with which it is regarded and to ensure that the sentence is commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, in the sense that, having regard to all the proved circumstances of the case, it accords with the general moral sense of the community. 
     
      
    15 The attack on Mr Hage was callous and cowardly. He was in no position to defend himself or resist in any way. He was a harmless man, simply walking home after his recreation at his local club. 
     
      
    16 The offender was totally unconcerned about his victim left lying on the ground and continued to the club to drink and dance, before returning to his ex girlfriend's house. 
     
      
       
        
      
    SENTENCE OF CO-OFFENDER17 Jason Young was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for his part in the attack. A non-parole period of four years was set. The Court was satisfied that Jason Young's assault upon the deceased was in the context of an intention to rob him, and I am satisfied that Jason Young was the instigator of the assault. 
     
      
    18 The present offender, to use a phrase utilised throughout the trial, 'joined in'. He played a significantly lesser role in the attack. The nature of the injuries, not amounting to grievous bodily harm, is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. Jason Young's subjective factors differ from the offender's. He is younger. He received a discount on sentence because of the plea of guilty and co-operation with the authorities. The Court took into account that Jason Young's sentence would be served in protection in harsher conditions. 
     
      
    19 Balancing those factors in this matter produces a similar result. The Court has to give consideration to that aspect because the inconsistency in the sentencing of co-offenders can give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
       
       
       
      THE OFFENDER'S SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
      
    20 The offender is now 23 years of age. He has a conviction for low range PCA and drive in a manner dangerous to the public. He has no criminal or social history of violence. He comes from a supportive home and had a happy childhood. He has a good relationship with his parents and siblings. He is suited to undertaking semi-skilled practical labouring work. He was regularly employed since leaving school. A psychological report points to a drinking problem that began to develop when the offender was seventeen. Ominously, the psychologist concluded, ""Under the influence of alcohol he would be more disinhibited and likely to act more impulsively."" 
     
      
    21 Alcohol played a large part in the offender's behaviour. He consumed a large quantity of alcohol and was affected by it at the time of the assault. He told the psychologist that he drank extremely heavily on Friday nights and then spent the rest of the weekend recovering. This pattern has now changed for him. He will need supervision on his release from prison to assist in his rehabilitation, in particular, not returning to the pattern of drinking heavily and acting impulsively.  
     
      
    22  I find that there are special circumstances in this case that require adjustment of the relationship between the non-parole period and the total term as governed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Court considers that a relatively short reduction in the non-parole period is appropriate to rehabilitation. In imposing sentence, the Court has also taken into account the youthfulness of the offender, which is a recognised mitigating factor. Generally, the younger the offender, the greater the weight that should be given to the element of youth. In this case, the youth of the offender plays some part. His present age and the fact that he has not been to prison before also indicate a need to foster the rehabilitation of the offender. 
     
      
       
      PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY 
       
      
    23 The offender was bail refused for a period of 54 days and he has been in custody since 14 September 2001. His sentence will be back-dated to 13 July 2001.  
     
      
    24 The prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for six years. I set a non-parole period of four years to commence on 13 July 2001 and to conclude on 12 July 2005, when the prisoner is eligible to be considered for release to parole. o0o

       RIXON v STAR CITY PTY LIMITED (formerly SYDNEY HARBOUR CASINO PTY LIMITED) 
       
       
       
      The appellant sued the respondent to recover damages for unlawful arrest, assault and false imprisonment. In June 1996, the appellant had been made the subject of an exclusion order issued under s79 of the  
      Casino Control Act 
       1992. On 25 November 1996, an employee of the respondent approached the appellant in the casino and informed him that, as an excluded person, he was required to follow him to an interview room. The appellant was held in this room for approximately an hour and a half before police arrived, during which time he claimed he suffered stress and anxiety.  
       
       
      Section 84 of the Act provided that a person the subject of an exclusion order must not enter the casino. Section 88(2) enabled a casino employee to detain a person who was in contravention of a prescribed provision. Clause 23 of the  
      Casino Control Regulation 
       1995 prescribed s84 for this purpose.  
       
       
      Section 85 provided for the removal of excluded persons from the casino. Section 88(1) enabled an inspector to detain a person suspected of contravening “a provision of this…Act”.  
       
       
      The trial Judge found that the employee’s actions could not amount to an assault because he lacked the requisite intention, or to a battery because he lacked the requisite hostile attitude. The actions for false imprisonment and unlawful arrest failed as the respondent acted within the scope of its legislatively conferred power in detaining the appellant.  
       
       
      The appellant challenged this decision on a number of grounds. 
       
       
      Held 
      : per Sheller JA, Priestley and Heydon JJA agreeing: 
       
      1. Clause 23(a) of the Regulation was not inconsistent with the Act. Although s85 provided for the removal of designated persons, and the regulation provided for their detention, s88(1) of the Act showed that detention and removal were not inconsistent in the scheme of the Act. 
       
      2. The fact that s85(2) refers to a person who “knows”, and that s88 refers to a person who “suspects on reasonable grounds” that an excluded person is in the casino is of little significance. It is highly unlikely that the legislative intent was to require a different state of mind on the part of casino employees in relation to detaining persons on the one hand, and removing them on the other. 
       
      3. The detention of the appellant was reasonable in the circumstances, and the Act clearly overrides any common law rights of personal liberty which might otherwise have made the detention wrongful. 
       
      4. The exclusion order was valid, as the person who issued it was duly authorised to do so. 
       
      5. There was no battery by the casino employee because the evidence suggested that his conduct was for the purpose of engaging the appellant’s intention, and was generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life.  
       
      6. It was open to the trial Judge to conclude that there was no assault because the respondent’s employee did not possess the necessary intention to create in the appellant an apprehension of imminent harmful conduct.

       RIXON v STAR CITY PTY LIMITED (formerly SYDNEY HARBOUR CASINO PTY LIMITED) 
       
       
       Judgment 
       
     1 PRIESTLEY JA: I agree with Sheller JA. 
     2 SHELLER JA:  
      
      Introduction 
       
       
      On 13 June 1996 Sydney Harbour Casino Pty Limited (SHC), which has since become Star City Pty Limited (SCPL), purported, pursuant to s79 of the  
      Casino Control Act  
      1992 (the Act), to give an exclusion order to the appellant, Brian Rixon. “Exclusion order” was defined in s3(1) of the Act as meaning a written order under s79 prohibiting a person from entering, or remaining in, a casino. 
        
      Section 79 of the Act provided, so far as presently relevant, as follows: 
       
       
        
        “(1) The Director or the casino operator or the person for the time being in charge of the casino may, by order given to a person verbally or in writing, prohibit the person from entering or remaining in a casino.” 
        
       
       
      The exclusion order was signed and given to Mr Rixon by John Bell, a security shift manager, employed by SHC. 
       
     3 “Casino” was defined in s3(1) of the Act to mean premises, or part of premises, defined as a casino for the time being under s19 of the Act. Section 19(1) of the Act provided for the boundaries of a casino to be defined “initially” by being specified in the casino licence, and enabled the New South Wales Casino Control Authority (the Authority) constituted under the Act to re-define the boundaries from time to time. The casino licence granted by the Authority to SHC on 14 December 1994 defined “casino” to mean for the Temporary Period, (that is to say that part of the period of licence before the Lease Commencement Date for the Permanent Site), as that part of the temporary site enclosed by the boundaries specified in Schedule 1. At the relevant time the casino premises were the temporary casino premises within the boundaries so specified. I shall refer to them as the “casino premises”.  
     4 On 25 November 1996 Mr Rixon was playing roulette in the casino premises. Employees of SHC identified Mr Rixon as a person the subject of an exclusion order, approached him and accompanied him to an “interview room” where he remained for a period of approximately one and a half hours until police officers arrived. Ultimately, Mr Rixon was escorted by police from the interview room elsewhere to be charged. 
      
       
      District Court Proceedings  
       
     5 Mr Rixon sued SCPL in the District Court to recover damages for alleged unlawful arrest, assault and false imprisonment. Mr Rixon claimed compensatory, exemplary, aggravated and punitive damages with interest. On 30 May 2000 her Honour Acting Judge Balla dismissed the proceedings. Mr Rixon by leave of the Court appeals from that decision. 
      
       
      Relevant legislation 
       
     6 Section 77(1) of the Act provided that a person enters and remains in casino premises “only by licence of the casino operator” with exceptions not here material. The following sections of the Act are significant in considering this appeal: 
      
       
        
        “Excluded person not to enter casino 
         
         
        84. A person the subject of an exclusion order must not enter or remain in a casino to which the order relates. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. 
         
         
        Removal of excluded persons from casino 
         
         
        85. (1) This section applies to the following persons in a casino:

          (b) an agent of the casino operator; 
          
         
         
          
          (c) a casino employee. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person to whom this section applies who knows that a person the subject of an exclusion order is in the casino, must remove the person from the casino or cause the person to be removed from the casino. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units. 
         
         
        (3) It is lawful for a person to whom this section applies, using no more force than is reasonable in the circumstances: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to prevent a person the subject of an exclusion order from entering the casino; and 
           
           
          (b) to remove such a person from the casino or cause such a person to be removed from the casino.

        obtain for himself or herself or another person, or induce a person to deliver, give or credit to him or her or another person, any money, chips, benefit, advantage, valuable consideration or security. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person must not, in a casino, use any device for the purpose of enabling the person or some other person to count or otherwise record cards dealt in the course of gaming in the casino unless the casino operator approves of its use. 
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. 
         
         
        (3) A person must not, in a casino or on premises of which a casino forms part, use or have in his or her possession: 
         
         
          
          (a) chips that he or she knows are bogus, counterfeit or stolen (within the meaning of sections 188, 189 and 189A of the Crimes Act 1900); or 
           
           
          (b) cards, dice or coins that he or she knows have been marked, loaded or tampered with; or 
           
           
          (c) for the purpose of cheating or stealing - any equipment, device or thing that permits or facilitates cheating or stealing. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. 
         
         
        (4) Subsection (3) does not prohibit the possession in a casino of any thing referred to in subsection (3) (a) or (b) by a person in charge of the casino, an agent of the casino operator, a casino employee, an inspector or a police officer, if that thing has been seized by any of those persons from another person for use as evidence in proceedings for an offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Detention of suspected person 
         
         
        88. (1) An inspector who suspects on reasonable grounds that a person in a casino has contravened, is contravening or is attempting to contravene a provision of this or any other Act may detain the suspected person in a suitable place in or near the casino until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any other person who is: 
         
         
          
          (a) for the time being in charge of a casino; or 
           
           
          (b) an agent of the casino operator; or 
           
           
          (c) a casino employee, 
          
         
         
        and who suspects on reasonable grounds that a person in the casino has contravened, is contravening or is attempting to contravene section 87 (Cheating) or a prescribed provision of this Act may detain the suspected person in a suitable place in or near the casino until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person may not be detained under this section unless: 
         
         
          
          (a) no more force is used than is proper in the circumstances; and 
           
           
          (b) the person detained is informed of the reasons for the detention; and 
           
           
          (c) the person effecting the detention immediately notifies a police officer of the detention and the reasons for the detention; and 
           
           
          (d) the person detained is detained for no longer than is reasonable to enable a police officer to attend.” 
          
         
        
       
     7 “Inspector” was defined by s3(1) of the Act to mean a person appointed by the Director of Casino Surveillance holding office as such under s102 to be an inspector for the purposes of the Act: see s106. An inspector might at any time enter and remain on the casino premises for various supervisory purposes: s108. The functions of inspectors were set out in s109 and their duties and powers in s110 and s111. These did not include removing persons from the casino premises. An inspector was not one of the persons to whom in that capacity s85 applied. 
     8 In summary s88(1) enabled an inspector who suspected on reasonable grounds that a person in a casino had contravened or was attempting to contravene a provision of the Act to detain the suspected person in a suitable place in or near the casino until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer. Section 88(2) gave more limited power to persons who were either for the time being in charge of the casino or an agent of the casino operator or a casino employee. They might detain persons on such grounds only where the contravention or attempted contravention was of s87 (cheating) or a prescribed provision of the Act. Neither Sir Laurence Street’s Report into the Establishment and Operation of Legal Casinos in New South Wales, nor the explanatory notes to the Act nor the Second Reading Speech explained the scheme of these subsections. 
     9 Clause 23 of the Casino Control Regulation 1995 (the Regulation) headed “Detention of suspected person for certain offences” provided that for the purposes of s88(2) of the Act, “the following provisions of the Act are prescribed: 
      
       
        
         
        (a) section 84 (Excluded person not to enter casino),…” 
        
       
       
     10 Section 170 of the Act provided: 
      
       
        
        “(1) The Governor may make regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, for or with respect to any matter that by this Act is required or permitted to be prescribed or that is necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act. 
         
         
        (2) In particular, regulations may be made for or with respect to any matter specified in Schedule 3. 
         
         
        (3) A provision of a regulation may: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) impose a penalty not exceeding 100 penalty units for a contravention of the provision; and 
           
           
          (b) provide that a contravention of the provision by a casino operator is to be considered to be a contravention of the conditions of the operator’s casino licence.” 
          
         
        
       
     11 Schedule 3 specified in twelve numbered paragraphs matters such as the installations, devices and equipment to be provided in a casino for gaming, advertising relating to a casino, notices to be displayed in a casino with respect to the availability of counselling and the form of contracts for the supply of goods or services to a casino. None related to the subject matter of clause 23(a) of the Regulation. 
      
       
      Mr Rixon’s case at trial 
       
     12 Mr Rixon was given the exclusion order as a consequence of an incident which occurred on the casino premises on 13 June 1996. He claimed that on that occasion he was thrown to the floor and put in leg and arm locks with his face on the carpet. According to a statement made by an attending police officer, a SHC employee had told Mr Rixon, when he was taken to the interview room, that he would be issued with an exclusion order and that he was prohibited from entering the casino while the order remained in force. The employee also explained to Mr Rixon the circumstances in which he could obtain a revocation of the order. Mr Rixon was arrested by the police and charged with assault. The charges were dismissed in the Local Court one or two months later. 
     13 According to Mr Rixon on 25 November 1996 he was playing roulette when someone grabbed him on the shoulder, said “Are you Brian Rixon?” and spun him around. Mr Rixon said he felt pain in his neck. He responded “Yes I’m Brian Rixon.” The other person said “Are you aware that you are an excluded person?” Mr Rixon said “No.” The other person then asked him to come with him. Mr Rixon said that if he was an excluded person, after going to court when the case against him was dismissed, he would leave. The other person requested him to go to the interview room. Mr Rixon went without the use of any physical force but in the belief that if he had not gone he would have been taken. At the trial there was no attempt, so far as appears, to lead evidence about the location of the interview room and in particular whether it was within the casino premises as specified in the licence. The parties seemed to assume that it was. Certainly s88(1) contemplated that the suspected person might be detained in the casino. 
     14 Mr Rixon said he asked to make a telephone call to his solicitor. This was refused. He said he felt nervous and was sweating and clammy. He asked to leave and was told he should not try. He then asked whether the SHC employee was going to smash him to the floor. According to Mr Rixon the employee smiled. He claimed that he was refused permission to go to the toilet on three or four occasions but was allowed to go after forty-five minutes. When he returned he asked to see a doctor. He informed the SHC employees present he had experienced unstable angina since the June incident and was experiencing those symptoms. Some time later a nurse arrived. Mr Rixon claimed to be feeling severely stressed and nervous with a heavy feeling around his chest.  
     15 When the police arrived Mr Rixon made a statement which was recorded in a notebook he signed. He told Detective Senior Constable Lee that he believed that he could return to the casino as the police charge had been dismissed. About the approach the SHC employee made to Mr Rixon in the casino the entry in the notebook read “When approached by casino staff to accompany them I willingly did so which can be verified by video tape of tonight’s incident.” Mr Rixon was taken to the police station and charged. The charges were heard in the Local Court in February 1997. 
      
       
      Other evidence 
       
     16 Other witnesses were called. Mr Ross Perry, an inspector employed by the Department of Gaming and Racing, was stationed at the casino in November 1996. He said that on 25 November he recognised Mr Rixon and contacted the surveillance department by telephone to confirm his identity. Mr Perry advised the person to whom he spoke that he believed a patron who had been excluded was gaming at a table. He gave the location of the patron by reference to the “table number, pit number”. He met Sasha Sheldon, an SHC employee, at the table and spoke to him. Shortly afterwards he saw Mr Sheldon speak to Mr Rixon and they both moved away to the interview room. He did not see Mr Sheldon touch Mr Rixon though he conceded in cross-examination that there was a point of time when Mr Sheldon was approaching Mr Rixon at the table and was standing between him and Mr Rixon. At that time he may not have been able to see what was happening to Mr Rixon. He did not see Mr Sheldon move his arm.  
     17 Mr Perry made notes of the incident and prepared a report which did not mention Mr Sheldon touching Mr Rixon or Mr Rixon complaining of any injury. Detectives Warren Lee and Robert Duncan from Gaming and Vice were contacted and attended at 21.55. 
     18 Mr Alison was the SHC surveillance director in November 1996. The evidence was that cameras were stationed throughout the casino premises, some in fixed positions and some adjustable. One camera was over each gaming table. SHC employees monitored the cameras in the monitor room. The procedure required an operator who monitored any incident which could be a security risk to complete a surveillance incident report. A video was extracted from the system if it was considered that it would be needed for the defence of the casino. A video of the incident in November 1996 had been made but could not be located. Mr Alison gave evidence that “one year ago” he ordered the destruction of all of the tapes made in the temporary casino. He said he believed there were no cases pending but agreed, on cross-examination, that he had not consulted anyone before making the decision and had not checked with the legal department. 
     19 Mr Alison had retained a short video of Mr Rixon in the interview room. He said it was standard procedure to make a thirty second film to show that a person had entered the casino in breach of an exclusion order. A copy of that video was sent to Mr Rixon’s solicitor by letter dated 28 January 1999. By letter in reply dated 5 February 1999 Mr Rixon’s solicitor inquired whether there was any other video of Mr Rixon. Mr Perry said that he had separate access to the cameras and took film independently of SHC. However, the film of Mr Rixon on that evening had not been retained. Mr Perry said that films were re-cycled after seven days unless they showed an incident of some note. He did not consider the entry of an excluded person to be an incident of some note. 
     20 Ms Kingston was a nurse employed by SHC at the casino in November 1996. She was called to attend Mr Rixon and her records were tendered. In the section headed “Injury” she recorded “General observations”. There was no mention of any injury to Mr Rixon’s neck. She took his blood pressure and pulse.  
     21 An incident report by T Brackenreg showed that security was first notified by Mr Perry of Mr Rixon’s presence in the casino at 20.29, Mr Rixon was approached by Mr Ross and Mr Sheldon at 20.34 and escorted “without force” to the interview room. Mr Rixon was escorted to the toilet at 21.49 and attended by Ms Kingston at 21.52. The police arrived at 21.57. An incident report completed by B London described Mr Rixon as leaving to attend the toilet at 21.46 and returning at 21.52 at which time a medic had been called as Mr Rixon was feeling chest pain.  
     22 Mr Sheldon did not give evidence. SHC tendered material designed to demonstrate that it had been unable to find Mr Sheldon and bring him to court. Mr Sheldon completed an incident report in which he stated:  
      
       
        
        “At 20.30 HRS I was contacted by Government Inspector Ross [sic no doubt a reference to Ross Perry] in regards to an excluded person who was inside the casino. I liased with Government Inspector Ross [sic] at pit three where he pointed out to me a male who was purchasing cigarettes from the cigarette machine near the southern entrance. The Government Inspector assured me that he and surveillance where [sic] definate [sic] that the male was excluded so I approached the male on the eastern side of pit four and invited him to interview room two to speak about the matter. The male now known to me as Bryan [sic] Rixon entered the interview room at 20.35 hours.”  
        
       
       
       
      Acting Judge Balla’s findings 
       
     23 The trial Judge found as follows: 
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff claims that he was grabbed on the shoulder by Sasha Sheldon and spun around. Counsel for the defendant has submitted that this evidence should be rejected as it is not mentioned in any of the contemporaneous incident reports or the statement made by the plaintiff to the attending police officer and is denied by Mr Perry. 
         
         
        I accept the evidence of the plaintiff in relation to the manner in which he was approached by Sasha Sheldon, that is that he placed his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder. I am satisfied that the plaintiff gave his evidence to the best of his recollection and made appropriate concessions in relation to the histories which he gave the various doctors. Mr Perry did concede that there was a point at which he would not have seen whether Sasha Sheldon did touch the plaintiff and I do not accept that the short summaries set out in the defendant’s internal records contain an exhaustive description which would necessarily include a gesture to attract the plaintiff’s attention. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the failure to call Sasha Sheldon I accept the submission made by counsel for the plaintiff that he could be described as being, in a broad sense, in the defendant’s camp being its former employee and the person whom the plaintiff says touched him on the shoulder. I do not think that the perfunctory attempts to locate him amount to a sufficient explanation for the failure to call him and I infer that his evidence would not have assisted the defendant. 
         
         
        I accordingly find, taking all of these matters into account, that Sasha Sheldon placed his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder. 
         
         
        I am not satisfied however that Sasha Sheldon used any degree of force or caused any injury to the plaintiff’s neck or shoulder when he put his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder while standing at the roulette table. In making this finding I have taken into account the plaintiff’s failure to mention any injury or force to the attending police officer, the nurse at the casino or to his treating doctors. 
        
       
       
        
        I also accept the plaintiff’s evidence as to the events which took place in the interview room after he was taken there up until he left. 
         
         
        The defendant denied that the incident at the roulette wheel amounted to battery and claimed that each of the causes of action relied on by the plaintiff were overridden by the provisions of the  
        Casino Control Act 
         1992. 
         
         
        Counsel for the defendant did not dispute that the provisions of the legislation overrode the common law, but submitted that they did not apply.” 
        
       
     24 Acting Judge Balla held that the exclusion order was valid and that SHC acted within the scope of the legislation in detaining Mr Rixon so that the claims for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment failed. 
     25 The trial Judge found that Mr Sheldon placed his hand on Mr Rixon’s shoulder without using any degree of force or causing any injury to Mr Rixon’s neck or shoulder. However, she did not accept that Mr Sheldon’s actions could be said to be an assault or battery because they lacked “the requisite intention in relation to assault and the requisite anger or hostile attitude in relation to battery.” 
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
     26 The grounds of Mr Rixon’s appeal were that the trial Judge erred in law in holding that the exclusion order given to Mr Rixon was valid, and that s88 of the Act gave SHC the power to detain Mr Rixon for breach of s84 of the Act (grounds 1 and 2) and in failing to hold that clause 23(a) of the Regulation was ultra vires (ground 3). Mr Rixon also claimed that the trial Judge erred in holding that Mr Sheldon’s physical contact with Mr Rixon did not in the circumstances amount to assault and ought to have held that Mr Rixon was assaulted, unlawfully arrested and falsely imprisoned by SHC (grounds 4 and 5). Finally Mr Rixon claimed that there was no evidence or insufficient evidence on which to base a finding that an agent or employee of SHC had reasonable grounds for suspicion that Mr Rixon had contravened s84 of the Act (ground 6). 
      
       
      Detention 
       
     27 Mr Rixon’s case was that his arrest was unlawful and his imprisonment false (that is wrongful) because it was without any lawful justification at all or became unlawful in the way Mr Rixon was detained or subsequently treated. SCPL relied upon clause 23 of the Regulation to enable its agent or employee to detain Mr Rixon “in a suitable place in or near the casino until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer” on suspicion of contravening s84.  
     28 Acting Judge Balla rejected Mr Rixon’s submission put in various ways that clause 23(a) of the Regulation was invalid with the result that his detention was to an unlawful arrest and false imprisonment. The grounds that, according her Honour, Mr Rixon relied on were: 
     · that s88 could apply only to the removal of patrons for cheating or a similar activity. Entering the casino premises as an excluded person was not such an activity; 
     · that clause 23(a) of the Regulation was inconsistent with the Act and was not made for or with respect to any matter by the Act required or permitted to be prescribed or necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to the Act or, in particular, made for or with respect to any matter specified in Schedule 3. Accordingly it fell outside the Governor’s regulation making power under s170 of the Act. Mr Rixon submitted that before the personal liberty of a subject could be infringed there must be a clear unambiguous statutory power. Acting Judge Balla was of the view that the legislation, first by providing that a visitor enters by way of a licence and next by providing lengthy and detailed procedures for the removal and detention of entrants, sufficiently demonstrated an intention to abrogate personal freedoms and common law rights; 
     · Mr Rixon also relied on s32(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 to submit that s170(2) qualified s170(1) to make the list of matters set out in Schedule 3 exhaustive. This submission, too, her Honour rejected. 
     29 On the application for leave to appeal from the District Court decision Senior Counsel for Mr Rixon put the matter differently. The alleged regulatory repugnancy stemmed from the legislative command in s85(2) that any of the person in charge of the casino, the agent of the casino operator or the casino employee who knew that a person, the subject of an exclusion order, was in the casino premises “must remove the person from the casino or cause the person to be removed from the casino.” As a matter of interest the subsection was amended in 2000 to provide that such person 
      
       
        
        “must, as soon as practicable after it becomes known to the person that a person the subject of an exclusion order ….. is in the casino, notify an inspector, and then remove the person, or cause the person to be removed, from the casino.” 
        
       
     30 Counsel submitted that the command in s85(2) that the person the subject of an exclusion order be removed from the casino premises, was inconsistent with clause 23(a) of the Regulation which, by prescribing s84, enabled the persons, namely the person for the time being in charge of the casino, the agent of the casino operator or a casino employee, if that person suspected on reasonable grounds that a person in the casino had contravened s84, to detain, pursuant to s88(2), the suspected person in a suitable place in the casino until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer. The importance of the matter both for the administration of the Act and the nature of the powers given to detain led the Court to grant leave to appeal. 
     31 The conditions upon which s85(2) and s88(1) and (2) operated are different. Section 85(2) imposed upon a person to whom the section applied “who knows that a person the subject of an exclusion order is in the casino” the obligation or duty to remove that person from the casino. Section 88 empowered an inspector (subs(1)) or the persons designated in subs(2) “who suspects on reasonable grounds that a person in the casino has contravened certain provisions of the Act” to detain the suspected person. In the one case the condition for the imposition of the obligation or duty is knowing, in the other case, the condition of the grant of power is suspecting on reasonable grounds.  
     32 The difference raises a question whether the two sections should be read as exclusive of each other. If the designated person “knows”, removal is required. If the designated person “suspects on reasonable grounds”, there is a power to detain but the obligation or for that matter power to remove does not arise. Thus, so it might be said, if a casino employee knew that Mr Rixon was the subject of an exclusion order the employee was bound to remove him from the casino but if the employee merely suspected on reasonable grounds that, contrary to s84, he had entered or remained in the casino he could detain him but not remove him. Neither party made submissions which adverted to or relied upon this difference in language. 
     33 In a dictionary sense, “know” means to perceive or understand as fact or truth or apprehend with clearness and certainty whereas “suspect” combined with the phrase “on reasonable grounds” means to believe. The distinction is clouded by the concepts in law of actual and constructive knowledge. In the present case, the knowledge required by s85(2) seems to combine a knowledge that a particular person is in the casino and that that person is the subject of an exclusion order. 
     34 In Vines v Djordjevitch (1955) 91 CLR 512 at 522 the High Court said: 
      
       
        
        “The word ‘know’ is used in the provision in an ordinary sense, without any intention that it should be analysed or refined upon. But of course there are gradations of knowledge or belief upon such a matter. The gradations extend from a slight inclination of opinion to complete assurance.” 
        
       
       
      The provision in that case concerned the knowledge of a person injured by a motor car that the identity of the motor car could not be established.  
       
     35 In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that the legislature intended that a casino employee, before acting to detain a person in the casino or remove that person from the casino, had to determine where his or her awareness or consciousness lay on the gradations between knowledge and suspicion. Perhaps carelessly the legislature has used different words without sufficient attention to the difference. As I have said, neither party relied upon the difference. In my opinion, it does not in itself result in there being no power in a person designated in s88(2) to detain a person in the casino because he or she “knew” that the person to be detained for contravening s84 was the subject of an exclusion order. 
     36 Mr Rixon submitted that clause 23(a) of the Regulation was repugnant to the Act and particularly s85(2). On the one hand the Regulation enabled the designated persons to detain an excluded person in the casino premises, on the other s85(2) required that such designated persons remove the excluded person from the premises. The Governor’s power under s170(1) of the Act was confined to making regulations “not inconsistent with” the Act. It was submitted that clause 23(a) of the Regulation was inconsistent with the Act. Accordingly, it should be regarded as varying or departing from the positive provisions made by the Act.  
     37 In Morton v Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited (1951) 83 CLR 402 the High Court was concerned with a statutory power to make regulations not inconsistent with the Excise Act 1901-1949 “prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or permitted to be prescribed or as may be necessary or convenient to be prescribed for giving effect to the Act or for the conduct of any business relating to the Excise”. At 410 the Court said: 
      
       
        
        “A power expressed in such terms to make regulations enables the Governor-General in Council to make regulations incidental to the administration of the Act. Regulations may be adopted for the more effective administration of the provisions actually contained in the Act, but not regulations which vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or regulations which go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself.” 
        
       
       
      It was argued, that clause 23(a) of the Regulation departed from the positive provisions of the Act and, because it was inconsistent with the Act, went outside the field of operation which s170(1) marked out. 
       
     38 Section 85(2) required the person to whom the section applied, relevantly the SHC’s agent or employee, to remove the person from the casino premises or cause the person to be removed from the casino premises under penalty. While the subsection did not expressly require immediate removal of the person subject to an exclusion order it did not contemplate the designated SHC employee permitting the excluded person to remain or preventing the excluded person from leaving the casino premises. The Act did not condition the command to remove so as, in particular circumstances, to allow the SHC employee to detain that person within the casino premises, that is to say, to refuse to let that person leave the casino premises.  
     39 If s88(2) of the Act alone was the source of power to detain persons suspected of contravening provisions of the Act, these arguments would have considerable force. But it is not the sole source of such power. Section 88(1) enabled an inspector to detain in the casino premises a person suspected of contravening “a provision of this or any other Act.” 
     40 The clear language of s88(1) cannot, in my opinion, be read down to mean “contravene a provision, other than s84, of this Act”. Thus s88(1) enabled an inspector who suspected that a person in the casino premises was the subject of an exclusion order to detain that person in the casino premises until the arrival at the place of detention of a police officer. 
     41 If an inspector detained a person in the casino premises on the reasonable suspicion that that person was the subject of an exclusion order, the execution by any of the persons designated in s85(2) of the Act of the duty to remove that person from the casino premises was necessarily postponed. The inspector was under no such duty to remove the person. However, even if he had been, the execution of the duty to remove would necessarily have been postponed during the period of detention. A degree of contradiction could accordingly be found between the requirements of s85(2) and s88(1), particularly if the removal contemplated by s85(2) could be read as entailing immediate removal or, in the language of the 2000 amendment, removal as soon as practicable after the person’s presence in the casino premises became known. But the purpose of s88 is clear. Contravention of provisions such as ss84 and 87 made the contravener liable to a penalty. Detention was permitted on reasonable suspicion of contravention to await the arrival of the police. The formal charging of such persons, if thought appropriate, was made by the police, no doubt after due investigation. In my opinion, s85(2) must be read in a way which accommodated the inspector’s power to detain under s88(1).  
     42 In the context of that legislative purpose, the circumstances that a person who contravened s84 by entering or remaining in casino premises is subject to a penalty and that s88(1) enabled an inspector to detain such persons until the arrival of a police officer inferentially so that the detained person be charged by the police, lead me to conclude that s85 should not be read as requiring immediate removal without detention under s88 and is not therefore repugnant to the regulatory extension under s88(2) of the power to detain persons reasonably suspected of being the subject of an exclusion order. 
     43 Nor do I think that there is any reason to read the Governor’s power to prescribe a provision of the Act within the meaning of s88(2) as limited to provisions proscribing conduct as serious as cheating or as, in some other way, regarded as like cheating. The purpose was to allow a person reasonably suspected of contravening provisions of the Act to be detained and held until the police arrive so that they could be charged and if the offence was proved penalised in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
     44 In my opinion, clause 23(a) of the Regulation was validly made. 
     45 The trial Judge found that the detention of Mr Rixon was made on reasonable grounds and that no more force was used than was proper in the circumstances. Her Honour said that Mr Rixon’s evidence established that he was informed of the reasons for the detention and that the police were notified immediately of the detention. Further, her Honour found that Mr Rixon was not detained for any longer than was reasonable to enable a police officer to attend at the casino premises. The evidence was that Mr Perry suspected that Mr Rixon was subject to an exclusion order. He had reasonable grounds for doing so. He spoke to Mr Sheldon who on the basis of what Mr Perry told him had reasonable grounds for so suspecting and asking Mr Rixon to go to the interview room. Nothing was put to the Court that persuaded me that these findings were not open to the trial Judge on the evidence. Reliance was placed on the size of Mr Sheldon (Mr Perry described him as “a big boy” weighing perhaps 120, 130 kilos) and Mr Rixon’s experience at the casino premises on 30 June 1996 to explain and justify some apprehension. But such apprehension, if it existed, does not undermine the trial Judge’s decision.  
     46 At the trial counsel for Mr Rixon drew attention to the cases which emphasise that the law in this country is very jealous of any infringement of personal liberty and that any statute which purports to impair a right to personal liberty is interpreted, if possible, so as to respect that right. “Unless the Parliament makes unmistakably clear its intention to abrogate or suspend a fundamental freedom, the courts will not construe a statute as having that operation.”; see Re Bolton (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 523, a passage which her Honour quoted. In my opinion, the Act made it unmistakably clear that s84 could be prescribed as a provision the suspected contravention of which, if on reasonable grounds, would enable the persons designated in s88(2) to detain the suspected person. Accordingly, in my opinion the appeal against her Honour’s conclusion that Mr Rixon’s case for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment must fail, also fails. 
      
       
      Validity of Exclusion Order  
       
     47 The appellant challenged the efficacy of exclusion order of 13 June 1996 and the authority of Mr Bell to issue it. There was evidence in the form of a letter of 25 January 1996 from SHC’s recruitment and placement director to Mr Bell that he had been appointed security shift manager effective from 29 January 1996. There was evidence in the form of a letter of 7 November 1995 from SHC and signed by David McGlinchey “General Counsel - Director of Compliance” to Mr R L Harrex, Director of Casino Surveillance, Department of Gaming and Racing, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        “EXCLUSION ORDERS: CASINO CONTROL ACT 1992; SECTION 79 
         
         
        I refer to our meeting on 24 October 1995 and confirm that the persons holding the following positions are authorised to issue Exclusion Orders for and on behalf of Sydney Harbour Casino;” 
         
        
       
      There follow a list of eight “positions” including “8. Security Shift Manager”. This letter was said by SCPL to be evidence that the person holding the position of security shift manager had been duly authorised by SHC to issue exclusion orders for and on its behalf; see s69 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995 and  
      Compafina Bank v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited 
       [1982] 1 NSWLR 409 at 412.  
       
     48 Mr Rixon submitted that the power of “the casino operator” under s79(1) of the Act to give an order prohibiting a person from entering or remaining in a casino must be exercised by the board of directors or, alternatively, a member of the executive or a person in senior management. But I see no reason so to limit its exercise. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that SHC could not by appropriate means authorise an officer to exercise this power. There is nothing to suggest that the authority was not duly given. There is evidence that it was duly given. Accordingly, in my opinion, this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
      Battery 
       
     49 Mr Rixon’s evidence about the alleged battery was specific. He described the approach of the SHC employee, by implication Mr Sheldon, as follows: 
      
       
        
        “I heard somebody grab me in the shoulder ….. and spun me around”. 
        
       
       
      In cross-examination he said: 
       
       
        
        “Q. Your account of the events Mr Rixon is that whilst you were standing at the roulette table someone approached you, put their hand on your shoulder and I think you said turned you around and then asked were you Brian Rixon or something to that effect, is that your evidence? A. That’s what happened. 
         
         
        Q. I suggest to you that no-one at that point touched you on the shoulder at all and that all that was simply done was you were approached and the question asked, are you Brian Rixon? A. That’s incorrect.” 
        
       
     50 Apparently the questioner’s phrase “put their hand on your shoulder” and Mr Rixon’s assent to the question led the trial Judge to “accept the evidence of the plaintiff in relation to the manner he was approached by Sasha Sheldon, that is that he placed his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder.” Placing the hand on the shoulder is not grabbing the shoulder, that is to say, seizing it suddenly. Her Honour must have rejected the evidence of grabbing and spinning around. Having made this finding, the trial Judge rejected Mr Rixon’s case in battery on the basis that the touching lacked “the requisite anger or hostile attitude”. 
     51 The placing of the hand on the shoulder could be a battery. As Holt CJ said in Cole v Turner (1704) 6 Mod 149; 87 ER 907 “the least touching of another in anger is a battery”. On the other hand, as the Chief Justice said, “if two or more meet in a narrow passage, and without any violence or design of harm, the one touches the other gently, it will be no battery”. 
     52 However the absence of anger or hostile attitude by the person touching another is not a satisfactory basis for concluding that the touching was not a battery. In In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) [1990] 2 AC 1 at 73 Lord Goff of Chieveley said: 
      
       
        
        “In the old days it used to be said that, for a touching of another’s person to amount to a battery, it had to be a touching ‘in anger’ (see  
        Cole v Turner 
         per Holt CJ); and it has recently been said that the touching must be ‘hostile’ to have that effect (see  
        Wilson v Pringle 
         [1987] QB 237, 253). I respectfully doubt whether that is correct. A prank that gets out of hand; an over-friendly slap on the back; surgical treatment by a surgeon who mistakenly thinks that the patient has consented to it - all these things may transcend the bounds of lawfulness, without being characterised as hostile. Indeed the suggested qualification is difficult to reconcile with the principle that any touching of another’s body is, in the absence of lawful excuse, capable of amounting to a battery and a trespass.” 
        
       
     53 In Collins v Wilcock [1984] 1 WLR 1172 Lord Goff (then Robert Goff LJ) sitting in the Divisional Court, at 1177-8 referred to the fundamental principle, plain and incontestable, that every person’s body is inviolate, and that any touching of another person, however slight may amount to a battery. His Lordship referred to Cole v Turner and to Blackstone’s Commentaries, 17th ed (1830) Vol 3, 120: 
      
       
        
        “the law cannot draw the line between different degrees of violence, and therefore totally prohibits the first and lowest stage of it; every man’s person being sacred, and no other having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner.” 
        
       
       
       
      His Lordship continued: 
       
       
        
        “But so widely drawn a principle must inevitably be subject to exceptions. For example, children may be subjected to reasonable punishment; people may be subjected to the lawful exercise of the power of arrest; and reasonable force may be used in self-defence or for the prevention of crime. But, apart from these special instances where the control or constraint is lawful, a broader exception has been created to allow for the exigencies of everyday life. Generally speaking, consent is a defence to battery; and most of the physical contacts of ordinary life are not actionable because they are impliedly consented to by all who move in society and so expose themselves to the risk of bodily contact. So nobody 
          
        can complain of the jostling which is inevitable from his presence in, for example, a supermarket, an underground station or a busy street; nor can a person who attends a party complain if his hand is seized in friendship, or even if his back is, within reason, slapped: see Tuberville v Savage (1669) 1 Mod 3. Although such cases are regarded as examples of implied consent, it is more common nowadays to treat them as falling within a general exception embracing all physical contact which is generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life. We observe that, although in the past it has sometimes been stated that a battery is only committed where the action is ‘angry, revengeful, rude, or insolent’ (see Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed (1824), vol 1, c15, section 2), we think that nowadays it is more realistic, and indeed more accurate, to state the broad underlying principle, subject to the broad exception 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        Among such forms of conduct, long held to be acceptable, is touching a person for the purpose of engaging his attention, though of course using no greater degree of physical contact than is reasonably necessary in the circumstances for that purpose. So, for example, it was held by the Court of Common Pleas in 1807 that a touch by a constable’s staff on the shoulder of a man who had climbed on a gentleman’s railing to gain a better view of a mad ox, the touch being only to engage the man’s attention, did not amount to a battery: see  
        Wiffin v Kincard 
         (1807) 2 Box & Pul 471; for another example, see  
        Coward v Baddeley 
         (1859) 4 H & N 478. But a distinction is drawn between a touch to draw a man’s attention, which is generally acceptable, and a physical restraint, which is not. So we find Parke B observing in  
        Rawlings v Till 
         (1837) 3 M & W 28, 29, with reference to  
        Wiffin v Kincard 
        , that ‘There the touch was merely to engage [a man’s] attention, not to put a restraint upon his person’.” 
        
       
     54 This distinction is explained in Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 17th ed, 12-06 where the question is posed whether the physical contact imposed on the plaintiff was in excess of that “generally acceptable in everyday life”. It is pointed out in a footnote that acceptable conduct must be considered in the context of the incident in dispute.  
      
       
        
         
        “For an adult to jump on another and snatch her shoulder bag is clearly unacceptable. Between 13-year-old schoolboys it might perhaps be seen as ‘as unremarkable as shaking hands’.” 
        
       
     55 No error has been demonstrated which would entitle this Court to interfere with the trial Judge’s finding that the touching lacked “the requisite anger or hostile attitude.” More accurately, and consistently with her Honour’s findings, it could not be said that the conduct of Mr Sheldon in the circumstances found and clearly for the purpose of engaging Mr Rixon’s attention, was not generally acceptable in the ordinary conduct of daily life. 
      
       
      Assault 
       
     56 A traditional definition of assault is “an overt act indicating an immediate intention to commit a battery, coupled with the capacity of carrying that intention into effect”; see Clerk & Lindsell 12-12. The irrelevance of the intention to carry the battery into effect is demonstrated by the act of presenting an unloaded firearm in such circumstances that if it had been loaded its discharge would have been likely to cause injury. Such an act is an assault unless the person at whom it is pointed knows that it is empty; see generally Clerk & Lindsell 12-13. 
     57 According to Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed, at 31-32: 
      
       
        
        “Assault consists in intentionally creating in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. …. there may be an assault without battery if the threat to inflict unlawful force is not in fact carried out. …. Since the gist of assault lies in the  
        apprehension 
         of impending contact, the effect on the victim’s mind created by the threat is the crux, not whether the defendant actually had the intention or the means to follow it up. The intent required for the tort of assault is the desire to arouse apprehension of physical contact, not necessarily to inflict actual harm.” 
        
       
     58 Proof of assault requires proof of an intention to create in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact; see, for example, Hall v Fonceca [1983] WAR 309. If the assault lies in creating an apprehension of impending contact, proof of the assault does not require proof of an intention to follow it up or carry it through. The trial Judge rejected the case in assault by finding “that the actions of the defendant’s employee lacked ‘the requisite intention in relation to assault’.” By this her Honour must have meant the intention to create in Mr Rixon an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Having rejected Mr Rixon’s account of being grabbed or spun round, her Honour’s finding that Mr Sheldon placed his hand on Mr Rixon’s shoulder without using any degree of force and said “Are you Brian Rixon?” led her to conclude that Mr Sheldon had no intention of creating in Mr Rixon an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive conduct. 
     59 In my opinion, the evidence left it open to her Honour to find that the necessary intention to create in Mr Rixon an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact was lacking. The appeal against the trial Judge’s decision that neither battery nor assault was made out accordingly fails. 
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
     60 In my opinion, Acting Judge Balla correctly dismissed Mr Rixon’s claims. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     61 HEYDON JA: I agree with Sheller JA.

       Judgment 
       
     1 MASON P: I invite Hodgson JA to give the first judgment. 
     2 HODGSON JA: On 4th August 2000, Gibb DCJ found a verdict for the defendants NSW Technical and Further Education Commission (TAFE) and Wyn Manners (Ms. Manners) in proceedings brought against them by Marcus Trevitt, and ordered Mr. Trevitt to pay the defendants’ costs of the proceedings. Mr. Trevitt has appealed from those orders.  
     3 The appellant’s claim arose out of an incident which occurred during a TAFE course which the appellant attended in 1997, when a mock hold-up was staged by another student at the instigation of Ms. Manners. The appellant claimed damages for psychological injuries resulting from alleged assault, false imprisonment, and negligence, and also exemplary damages. Before considering the grounds of appeal, it is convenient to outline the background circumstances. 
      
       
      BACKGROUND CIRCUMSTANCES 
     4 The appellant was born on 8th July 1964. He completed the HSC in 1982. He commenced a degree in engineering and science at the University of Sydney, and left that course after eighteen months. In 1985 he commenced an Arts/Law degree at the University of New South Wales, and he left that course after six months. He then travelled in New Zealand and Asia. After his return, he continued with an Arts degree at the University of New South Wales, which he completed in 1988.  
     5 He then worked for his father in the Pilbara for about four months, then travelled in Europe, and then worked for his father again for about a year. He travelled around southern Australia for a time, and in 1992 he went to the Hunter District of New South Wales, where he lived on “a bit of inheritance” and the dole. In 1996 he went to Armidale, where he worked from time to time on a herb farm.  
     6 In 1997, at the suggestion of Social Security, he took a thirteen week “industrial cooking” course at the New England Institute of TAFE in Armidale.  
     7 On 12th August 1997, the appellant was in a class on occupational safety and security conducted by Ms. Manners, with ten or twelve other students. At about 11.30am, another student “Graham” left the classroom, and shortly afterwards came back dressed in army fatigues and carrying what looked like a pistol. Graham shouted a couple of times that everyone was to get on to the floor. The other students did not move. Graham put his hand on the appellant’s shoulder and put the metal object he was carrying against the appellant’s head. The appellant reached up to remove the object from his head, and Graham pushed him to the floor. Graham then demanded that the students give him their wallets or money. The appellant passed his wallet to another student. Graham left the room. The incident took about one or two minutes. 
     8 When the appellant got up, he saw that Ms. Manners was still sitting on her desk. The incident had been a role play. Ms. Manners had previously used role plays in the course, but this was the first time a role play had occurred without warning. Graham returned to the room, there was discussion about what had happened, and the class was required to fill out “police forms” and to identify the things that Graham had worn, and so on. 
     9 The appellant gave evidence to the effect that he may have missed one day’s attendance at TAFE following this incident, but otherwise continued to attend the course. After about a week or so, he went to see the TAFE counsellor, and spoke twice to him, and also to the head teacher Helen Steward. 
     10 On 4th September 1997, the appellant filled out a customer complaint form. The details of the complaint set out on the form are attached to the end of this judgment. 
     11 Some months later, the appellant made some corrections to this document, and also added the following words: “I was forced to the ground when I reached up to remove the pistol as it felt uncomfortable against my head”. 
     12 On 23rd September 1997, the campus manager Mr. Binnington wrote to Mr. Trevitt the following response to the complaint: 
      
       
        
        You recently submitted a Customer Complaint Form at this Campus and I would like to assist you in reaching a satisfactory outcome. I have made some preliminary enquiries and to progress the matter further I feel it is necessary for you to meet with me. 
         
         
        Could you please contact me or my assistant Mrs Wendy Marsden on 6773 7704 to make an appointment.  
         
         
        I look forward to being of assistance to you. 
        
       
     13 On 30th September 1997, the appellant met with Mr. Binnington and Ms. Steward to discuss the complaint. On the same day, Mr. Binnington sent a further letter to the appellant, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        Thank-you for calling at my office today and discussing your concerns with Helen and myself. I respect the position you have taken regarding the resolution of this matter. Firstly I must say that I regret that this incident has caused you deep concern and I apologise on behalf of this Institute. 
         
         
        This afternoon I met collectively with Wyn Manners, the teacher involved, and with Helen Steward. This meeting gave me the opportunity to listen to Wyn's description of the role play and the events prior to and immediately after the event. Following her explanation I expressed my concern to her regarding the reality of the role play and how this had affected you as an individual. I pointed out that individual differences in all of our students are important when developing teaching strategies as reactions can be widely varied. 
         
         
        It is apparent to me that the key to this issue is the reality in which the ""bandit"" role was carried out including the props used. This reality occurred due to the prior training and experiences of the ""bandit"" and also due to the lack of guidelines given to him by the teacher. Wyn has informed me that she has used this particular role play on many other occasions but never has she experienced such reality induced by the ability of the individual. She accepts that the reality was beyond what she expected and realises that the student was able to put an undefined reality into the role due to a lack of guidelines to the students. 
         
         
        It must be pointed out that at all times throughout the role play it was apparent that the ""bandit"" was a class member and not disguised in any way and there were a range of anticipated reactions from students. Wyn assures me that your reaction was never anticipated and with the benefit of hindsight would have modified the reality of the role play. 
         
         
        I believe it is worth noting that the subject of Occupational Safety and Security is a very serious one dealing with emergencies in the real world of the hospitality industry where the risks are quite high. The role play was intended to simulate a real occurrence and to be able to deal with feelings and subsequent actions of individuals in such a situation. The debriefing after the event would under most circumstances take care of any concerns of individuals. It would appear that the usual debriefing was not effective for your particular concerns. 
         
         
        To prevent future occurrences of similar events I have taken the following appropriate action: 
         
        * Wyn has been directed that any planned use of role plays will be advised to her Head Teacher. 
         
        * Wyn has also been directed to issue strict guidelines to students involved in ""surprise"" role plays. These guidelines are to be approved by the Head Teacher. 
         
        * A memorandum has been sent to all Head Teachers advising them of the need to strictly control role plays in order not to cause distress, embarrassment or danger to any participants. 
         
         
        Wyn has expressed to me her regret that you feel you have been adversely affected by the role play and as such wishes to apologise to you. From our discussion Wyn has indicated that she would like to meet with you to personally apologise for the concern that you feel and she looks forward to having a productive teacher/student relationship with you during Term 4. 
         
         
        I am confident that I have taken the necessary action to prevent any repeat of a role play that will cause distress to students. If you wish to further discuss the essence of your complaint please feel free to contact me on 67737705. 
        
       
     14 The appellant completed his course in December 1997, with good results.  
     15 The appellant first consulted a medical practitioner concerning the incident on 9th April 1998, when at the request of his solicitors he saw Dr. Synott. Dr. Synott’s report contains the following history given by the appellant: 
      
       
        
        Angry about an incident that occurred at TAFE in September, 1997. He was attending a hospitality course when the lecturer organised a ""mock"" hold-up -this was explained with the comment of ""the hospitality industry can be very dangerous"". The patient was, unsuspectingly, taken as a hostage during this mock hold-up and he found it threatening and humiliating. He was frightened and unsettled by the event. He felt the lecturer had been quite inappropriate in her decision to organise the event and that there should have been some consequences (perhaps even sacking her). He did not raise this directly with her but approached the manager of TAFE, whom he felt was unsympathetic and dismissive of his complaint. 
         
         
        Since that time he has found himself ""feeling bad"", loss of confidence and ""they made me feel weak"". He has tended to be a little avoidant in going out and confronting things. Although wishing some major action to be taken against the teacher, and perhaps the manager, he has not been prepared to confront them, although he did write a letter. He also acknowledged some sense of depression, but denied any suicide ideation. 
        
       
     16 Dr. Synott recorded the following impression and diagnosis: 
      
       
        
        Impression. 33 year old unemployed man presents with various symptoms, which he directly relates and attributes to an event/mock robbery in which he was an unwilling participant, at TAFE eight months ago. 
         
         
        The patient willingly described himself as ""passive"" and on several occasions acknowledged his lack of consistency and discipline and that is certainly highlighted in the history given by him. He has become phobic and avoidant, a tendency he displayed well and truly before the event and has looked to others to react as he feels they ""should"". He blames others for his sense of ""they made me feel weak"". 
         
         
        Although acknowledging a sense of depression he did not want antidepressants. 
         
         
        Differential diagnosis. 
         
        Axis 1. Adjustment reaction with anxiety and depression 
         
        Axis 2. Personality. Dependent traits, query some schizoid traits. 
         
         External locus of control 
         
         Limited personality resources 
         
         Immature defence mechanisms - projection, distortion. 
        
       
     17 Subsequently, the appellant saw another psychiatrist Dr. Jungfor on 10th November 1998. That report sets out the following history: 
      
       
        
        Mr Marcus Trevitt indicates that in 1997 he was undertaking a TAFE course at Armidale. He indicates that this course was in the area of hospitality and it was while undertaking one of the subjects that Mr Trevitt feels that he was injured. Mr Trevitt was undertaking a 13 week TAFE course for those individuals who are long term unemployed. It was approximately 10 weeks into the course and he was learning the safety and security module when the incident happened. Mr Trevitt can clearly recall the incident and can picture it within his mind with minimal effort. Mr Trevitt indicates that he remembers an individual by the name of Grahame left the room. He thought that Grahame must have gone out of the room to have a cigarette however the next thing he recalls is that Grahame returned to the room in an Army jacket with the hood up, wearing gloves. Mr Trevitt indicates that Grahame screamed to class, ""everyone on the ground"". Mr Trevitt can recall clearly that he knows that it was Grahame, a fellow student and believes that he thought that something may have happened to Grahame to encourage him to act this way. Immediately following Grahame returning to the room and telling everyone to get on the ground Mr Trevitt can recall that he was extremely confused and didn't know what was going on. He was aware that no-one knew what was happening. He can recall having the gun put to his head and felt that his entire body went hot and he was extremely fearful. Subsequent to this he felt feelings of embarrassment and humiliation. He can recall Grahame thumping around the room asked people for wallets. He was lying on the floor, he didn't move and he was concerned that he may be punched or kicked in the head by someway. He knows that a girl was being used as a shield and that the women looked scared and he can recall this quite clearly. At some stage that class recognised as a. group what was happening, however Grahame left and Marcus felt that everyone was confused and paralysed and uncertain as to what they had experienced. Grahame was apparently carrying a gun, it was a mock gun but it looked exactly like that of a pistol. He remembers when Grahame had left the room that he was just simply lying there, that people were wondering what was going on and he was waiting for people to move. He was fearful that Grahame would return and that Grahame may shock them in some way by returning and becoming increasingly aggressive and violent. Apparently 4-5 minutes later Grahame returned to discuss the incident. Mr Trevitt clearly recalls the teacher laughing and smiling following the incident and that she discussed with them wanting them to experience a situation of an armed hold up. He believed that the situation was real and that he can recall the teacher laughing at him. He is also aware that another woman thought the situation was real and that she ceased the course on that day. Following the incident Mr Trevitt can recall being extremely anxious and jittery , he wondered what he could do about the situation. He recalls during the situation feeling quite useless, ashamed and embarrassed. Following this he felt very depressed. 
         
         
        After the incident Mr Trevitt described increasing feelings of depression and a sense of hopelessness. He became socially withdrawn and isolated. He was unable to talk to people and wanted to deal with the situation himself. He constantly ruminated regarding the incident. He attempted to return to college to complete his course and sought out the manager of the course because he felt the situation needed to be addressed. However he was unable to successfully return to TAFE although he has completed the course. He feels the actions of the TAFE manager with regards to addressing the situation were inappropriate and that the TAFE did not handle the situation seriously. Apparently 5 days after the incident Mr Trevitt saw the college counsellor who indicated to him what his rights were but no treatment was offered to him. 
        
       
     18 Dr. Jungfor expressed the following opinion: 
      
       
        
        OPINION 
         
        17. Mr Marcus Trevitt is a 34 year old individual who is somewhat avoidant of social situations and isolative gentlemen who was involved in a mock hold up situation in the course of his studies. As a consequence of how the situation was handled and the behaviour of his teacher Mr Trevitt felt at one stage quite fearful for his life and subsequently humiliated and embarrassed that such a situation should have arisen. Subsequent to this he developed an avoidance of social situations. Initially he had nightmares, recurrent intrusive recollections of the incident, hypervigilence and avoidance of the situation which was consistent with that of a post traumatic stress disorder. However these symptoms have now largely resolved and he is left with some mild residual psychological symptoms that are best considered that of an adjustment reaction. Mr Trevitt almost certainly was pre morbidly someone is excessively vulnerable to the development of such a condition and it has improved significantly despite the lack of any form of appropriate psychological intervention. It is however my recommendation that he receive some psychological treatment for this condition to improve his recovery from the situation at hand. It is my opinion that Mr Trevitt would not be in the current circumstances that he is in and his psychological state were he not to have been exposed to this situation. He should be acknowledged and rewarded for the recovery that he has made to this point in time and it would be my expectations that Mr Trevitt would be able to show significant recovery with appropriate treatment. There is no doubt however that the experience that he has had was quite unnecessary and resulted in a significant degree of trauma and distress to him. 
        
       
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
     19 The appellant gave evidence that he believed the incident was genuine until some time after Graham had left the room; and that when he was on the floor, he was afraid that Graham would kick him if he raised his head. The primary judge found the appellant’s evidence unsatisfactory, and rejected the appellant’s evidence on both these points. The primary judge found that the appellant believed that the mock hold-up was real only for a brief instant, referring inter alia to the consideration that he would not have reached up to remove the metal object against his head if he had believed that Graham was a genuine armed robber; and she found that by the time the appellant was on the floor, he knew that Graham was role playing and had no fear that he would be kicked.  
     20 The primary judge found that at no time did the appellant hold any apprehension of any imminent harmful or offensive conduct, and held that there was no assault and no false imprisonment.  
     21 The primary judge noted that if there had been assault or false imprisonment, there would be questions concerning the liability of Ms. Manners and TAFE, and of damages.  
     22 As regards the former, the respondents conceded that Graham was their agent in as much as Ms. Manners in the course of her employment by TAFE had appointed Graham as her agent to play the role of a bandit; but they made no admission in respect of the scope of his authority as he played his role. The primary judge was not satisfied that Graham’s actions were within the scope of his ostensible or real authority or instructions.  
     23 As regards damages, the primary judge found that the appellant suffered no actual damage, so that she would have awarded nominal damages only. The primary judge analysed the medical evidence. She accepted Dr. Synott’s diagnosis, and noted his silence about any causal relationship between the incident and the appellant’s psychological problems. The primary judge rejected Dr. Jungfor’s opinion to the effect that the appellant’s psychological symptoms had been caused by the incident, inter alia because the primary judge found the history given to Dr. Jungfor was inaccurate. The primary judge dealt similarly with Dr. Phillips’ opinion to similar effect.  
     24 The primary judge was not satisfied that the appellant suffered any injury from the event; and found that his concern was the affront to his dignity, and the perceived inadequacy of the response of Ms. Manners and TAFE to his complaint.  
     25 The primary judge found there was no liability in negligence, because no damage was suffered.  
     26 The primary judge found that this would not be a case for exemplary damages in any event. Although she considered that Ms. Manner’s conduct in authorising the surprise mock hold-up was silly, and that TAFE’s system was inadequate in that TAFE let it happen, the primary judge considered that the response to the complaint was appropriate and adequate.  
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
     27 The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 
      
       
        
        1. The Appellant was denied procedural fairness in that there were adverse findings made against him when such adverse findings were either not the subject of cross-examination by the Respondent, or were not otherwise challenged by the Respondent, and were not the subject of any discussion or warning during the course of submissions by counsel. 
         
         
        2. Her Honour erred in law in failing to hold that upon the evidence there was no assault, false imprisonment or negligent infliction of nervous shock. 
         
         
        3. Her Honour erred in fact and in law in finding that Graham was an agent who acted outside the scope of his agency when the Respondent conceded that Graham was appointed their agent to play the role of the bandit in the mockup up exercise. 
         
         
        4. There was no evidence to support Her Honour's finding that Graham acted outside the scope of his agency, authority or instructions when carrying out the role of the bandit in the mock-up exercise.  
         
         
        5. Her Honour's finding that the Appellant knew that the hold-up was a role play at an early point of time in the exercise was against the evidence and the greater weight of evidence . 
         
         
        6. Having found that there was a battery committed upon the Appellant, Her Honour was wrong as a matter of law in not having made the finding that there was an assault which had been committed upon the Appellant. 
         
         
        7. Her Honour's finding that the Appellant did not hold an apprehension of any imminent harm or offending conduct is glaringly improbable and against the greater weight of evidence. 
         
         
        8. Her Honour misdirected herself in relation to the intention required on the cause of action relating to false imprisonment. 
         
         
        9. Her Honour was wrong as a matter of law and fact in finding that the Appellant did not suffer any damage with respect to the cause of action based upon negligent infliction of nervous shock. 
         
         
        10. Her Honour's finding that the Appellant suffered no damages to any of the causes of action upon which she relied was glaringly improbable and against the greater weight of the evidence. 
         
         
        11. Her Honour's indication as to the general damages which she would have awarded, had she found in favour of the Appellant, is manifestly inadequate. 
         
         
        12. Her Honour's finding that in the circumstances she would not have awarded exemplary damages had she have found in favour of the Appellant is manifestly wrong. 
        
       
     28 I will deal with these grounds under five headings.  
      
       
      ATTACK ON PRIMARY FINDINGS (GROUNDS 1, 5 AND 7) 
     29 In the appellant’s written submissions, it was submitted first that there had been no challenge by cross-examination or otherwise to contest the version of events given by the appellant; to suggest that the appellant was an unreliable historian or witness and, in particular, to suggest that he knew that the exercise was not real prior to the time that the gun was placed to his head; to suggest that varying and untrue versions had been given to psychiatrists; to suggest that the evidence of the psychiatrists should, for that reason or otherwise, be rejected; or to suggest that any injury to the appellant may have been caused by his affront at the letter of 30th September 1997.  
     30 It was submitted accordingly that it was procedurally unfair of the primary judge (1) to find that the appellant realised after a brief instant that it was a mock hold-up; (2) to find that the appellant at no time had any apprehension of imminent harm; and (3) to reject the psychiatrists’ opinions as to causation of psychological injury because of alleged inconsistencies in histories given to them. The written submissions referred to Stead v. State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141; Escovar v. Spindaleri (1986) 7NSWLR 51; Goktas v GIO of NSW (1993) 31 NSWLR 684 at 700; Beale v. GIO of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430. 
     31 The written submissions also contended that these three findings were against the weight of evidence. These submissions were elaborated by Mr. Capelin QC in oral submissions before us. He took us to a number of findings by the trial judge concerning the appellant’s evidence, which he submitted were extreme and wholly unjustified. 
     32 In my opinion, it was plainly suggested to the appellant in cross-examination that he knew that there was not a real pistol held against his head when he reached up to remove it; that the occasion for these proceedings was anger and a perceived affront to his dignity, not psychological injury, and that the real issue was money; and that he had completed his course successfully, with the loss of at most one day’s attendance. These suggestions involved the contention that the version of events given by the appellant in the witness box and to the psychiatrists was incorrect, that the appellant was an unreliable historian and witness, and that the incident did not cause psychological injury. The incorrectness of histories given to the psychiatrists was not squarely put; but in my opinion the challenges made to the appellant’s account necessarily amounted to a challenge to those histories, and laid the groundwork for attacking the psychiatrists’ opinions.  
     33 For those reasons, in my opinion the charge of procedural unfairness is not made out.  
     34 Turning to the question whether the findings, and in particular the three crucial findings to which I have referred, were against the weight of evidence, I note that these findings all depended crucially on the primary judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  
     35 Having regard to apparent inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, the circumstance that the appellant quickly recognised that it was a fellow student carrying out the purported hold-up, the previous occurrence of role plays, and the appellant reaching up to push the “gun” away from his head because it was uncomfortable, I am unable to find that there was appealable error in the primary judge making a finding that the appellant realised, after a brief instant, that this was a mock hold-up.  
     36 As regards the finding that there was never any apprehension of imminent harm, the same factors apply, coupled with the finding that the appellant quickly realised that it was a mock hold-up. On the other hand, it is plain that the appellant was pushed to the ground physically; and even accepting that the appellant realised that it was role play, this amounted to some physical harm and indicated that Graham was willing and able to inflict such harm in his role play. Furthermore, even though the appellant said in evidence that he felt safe on the ground and was happy to be there, the fact is that he had been physically pushed to the ground, and it is by no means inconsistent with his recognition that this was role play that he would be afraid of being kicked.  
     37 However, having regard to the advantageous position of the trial judge, I am not satisfied that there is appealable error in relation to this finding of fact either.  
     38 In my opinion, these findings of primary fact do undermine the psychiatric opinions, and accordingly there is no appealable error in the finding that causation of psychological injury was not made out.  
      
       
      ATTACKS ON THE PRIMARY JUDGE’S FAILURE TO FIND ASSUALT, FALSE IMPRISONMENT, OR NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF SHOCK (GROUNDS 2, 6, 8 AND 9) 
     39 In the light of the primary findings of fact, in my opinion it cannot be suggested that the primary judge was in error in so far as she found that Graham did not assault the appellant in the sense of arousing the apprehension of imminent harmful conduct, that the appellant was not subject to total restraint of movement, and that there was no negligent infliction of shock. The finding that the appellant at no time was under any apprehension of imminent harmful conduct is not in my opinion inconsistent with the appellant realising that this was a mock hold-up only after a brief instant: the primary judge presumably considered that that brief instant did not involve any formation of apprehension of imminent harmful conduct. However, this still leaves the actual placing of a metal object against the appellant’s head and the pushing of him to the ground. The primary judge found that these acts would amount to battery, but went on to say that that was not the appellant’s claim.  
     40 However, the Statement of Claim alleged that the plaintiff had “a dangerous weapon held to his head” and “was forced to lie face down on the ground”. The plaintiff’s final submissions before the primary judge contained the following: 
      
       
        
        Any assault may also be established by an unlawful application of physical force. The plaintiff had a gun placed on his head and was physically thrown to the ground and was thereby assaulted. 
        
       
     41 Similar submissions were repeated on appeal. 
     42 In my opinion, the fact that these acts were described in the Statement of Claim as amounting to assault rather than battery would not justify the primary judge’s assertion that battery was not claimed. These acts, assuming they were not consented to, amounted to trespass to the person, describable in common parlance as assault, even though the term “battery” may be more technically correct. In my opinion, it is plain that the appellant did not consent to these acts. In my opinion, the primary judge was in error in failing to find that Graham had committed trespass to the person, whether described as assault or battery, upon the appellant.  
      
       
      ATTACK ON FINDING THAT GRAHAM ACTED OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF HIS AGENCY (GROUNDS 3 AND 4) 
     43 It is common ground that Ms. Manners instigated the role play, and that TAFE is liable for this conduct of hers in the course of her employment.  
     44 For the appellant, it was submitted that there was evidence supporting an inference that what Graham did was within the instructions given to him by Ms. Manners. It was plain that the instructions contemplated a realistic occurrence, inter alia from the circumstance of surprise and lack of warning. Ms. Manners was present throughout what happened, made no attempt to interfere, and subsequently commended Graham on his performance. No suggestion was made that he exceeded his instructions, except the suggestion in the letter of 30th September that the realism of the occurrence went beyond what was expected. This letter however tendered an apology, and gave an assurance that, in the future, steps would be taken to control this type of occurrence.  
     45 In my opinion, those matters would be sufficient to support an inference that what Graham did was within his instructions. Furthermore, in my opinion the primary judge was in error in applying Jones v. Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 to the appellant’s failure to call Graham. In my opinion, Graham, although not in the respondents’ camp, could not be regarded as being in the appellant’s camp or a witness whom the appellant could be expected to call. He was a witness who could be expected to have his own interests in giving evidence, which would be quite likely to conflict with those of the appellant. This is a very different case from cases such as Ho v. Powell [2001] NSWCA 168, where it was the party himself who did not give evidence, even though he was present in court ready to give evidence, and where there was only one issue on which he could have given evidence. 
     46 Accordingly, in my opinion the primary judge was in error in two respects: firstly, in failing to find there were matters from which an inference could be drawn, and secondly, in applying Jones v. Dunkel against the appellant. In my opinion this Court should reach its own conclusion. In my opinion, Jones v. Dunkel applies against the respondents, because Ms. Manners could have given evidence as to her instructions to Graham. In my opinion, the inference should be drawn that what Graham did was within his instructions, and accordingly the respondents are liable for the battery committed by Graham. 
      
       
      ATTACK ON THE FINDING OF NO DAMAGE (GROUNDS 10 AND 11) 
     47 Although I have found there was no error in the primary judge’s finding that there was no causation of the psychological problems described by the medical experts, in my opinion there was plain error in the finding that there was no damage at all.  
     48 I have upheld the primary judge’s findings that the appellant’s psychological difficulties were not caused by the incident, and the appellant is not entitled to damages for dissatisfaction with TAFE’s subsequent conduct. However, there being no contrary view expressed by the primary judge, I would accept that the appellant was caused substantial upset and that as a result of this incident, he felt he had been singled out and humiliated. In so far as the appellant’s injured feelings continued because they were not allayed by remedial conduct, as distinguished from actually being caused by TAFE’s later conduct, he is entitled to compensation for this as well. I do not think any attempt should be made to draw any distinction between distress caused by the battery and distress caused by the rest of the incident. 
     49 The distress suffered by the appellant was in my opinion due to his having a vulnerable personality, and would probably not have otherwise been suffered; but this does not in my opinion prevent damages being awarded for that distress for the tort of trespass to the person. Liability for trespass to the person does not require proof of foreseeability of damages, and in my opinion once liability for that tort is established the wrongdoer must take the victim as he finds him. 
     50 Given the approach I have taken in this judgment, I think it is common ground that this Court should attempt to assess damages rather than send the matter back for a new trial. Doing the best I can on the basis I have indicated, I would assess the damages for the appellant’s injured feelings, distress and affront to dignity at $2,000.00. 
      
       
      ATTACK ON THE DENIAL OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (GROUND 12) 
     51 It was submitted that the incident showed the clearest disregard for the rights, interests, welfare and dignity of the appellant, so that an award of exemplary damages was justified.  
     52 In my opinion, there was wrongful conduct by the respondents, but it was not contumelious: it flowed from a misguided view as to what would be helpful to the students being instructed. It caused damage to the appellant, to a large extent because of his vulnerable personality. I do not think a case is made out for exemplary damages.  
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
     53 For those reasons, I would propose that the appeal be allowed, that the judgment below for the respondents be set aside, and that there be judgment for the appellant against each respondent for $2,000.00. I would add that in awarding that sum, it is intended that it include interest up to the present. 
     54 MASON P: I agree. 
     55 HEYDON JA: I agree with the reasons for judgment of Hodgson JA save in respect of battery and damages.  
     56 Assuming that the plaintiff did not consent to the placing of a hand on his shoulder, the placing of a metal object against his head and the pushing of him to the ground, those acts were batteries. There was no allegation in terms in the Statement of Claim of any “battery”. Paragraph 11 said: 
      
       
        
        During the course of the armed holdup, the plaintiff was assaulted 
         
        Particulars of Assault 
         
        The plaintiff had the dangerous weapon held to his head. 
         
        The plaintiff was forced to lie, face down, on the ground. 
         
        The plaintiff feared that he may be subject to physical violence at any time during the mock armed holdup. 
         
        At no time did the plaintiff consent to being subjected to a 
          
        mock armed holdup. 
        
       
       
      Paragraph 13 said: “The plaintiff claims that the second defendant is liable for assault … .” 
       
     57 To describe the acts in question as assaults corresponds with the ordinary use of language, but is, at least in the law of tort as distinct from criminal law, legally erroneous. Francis Trindade and Peter Cane, The Law of Torts in Australia (3rd ed, 1999) defined battery thus (at p 27): 
      
       
        
        A battery is a direct act of the defendant which has the effect of causing contact with the body of the plaintiff without the latter’s consent.  
        
       
       
      They define assault thus (at p 42): 
       
        
        An assault is any direct threat by the defendant that places the plaintiff in reasonable apprehension of an imminent contact with the plaintiff’s person either by the defendant or by some person or thing within the defendant’s control. 
        
       
       
      See also John G Fleming,  
      The Law of Torts 
       (9th ed, 1998) pp 29-33. This legal error is repeated in Ground 6 of the Notice of Appeal: 
       
        
        Having found that there was a battery committed upon the Appellant, Her Honour was wrong as a matter of law in not having made the finding that there was an assault which had been committed upon the Appellant. 
        
       
     58 I agree with Hodgson JA that the erroneous description in the Statement of Claim of the placing of a metal gun against the plaintiff’s head and the pushing of him to the ground as assaults but not batteries does not mean that a claim for battery was not made. The duty of the plaintiff was to plead material facts. He did so; though only in the particulars and not, as he should have, in the substantive paragraphs of the Statement of Claim. The ascription to the relevant acts of a legal characterisation different from that which they in truth bore did not mislead the defendants and cannot by itself prevent the plaintiff from recovering whatever remedy justly flows from his successful proof of those facts.  
     59 However, the form of the Statement of Claim does not conclude the matter. Soon after the start of the final addresses the following exchange took place between the trial judge, counsel for the defendants (Mr Weinstein) and counsel for the plaintiff (Mr Eburn) (Black 39R-41F): 
      
       
        
        HER HONOUR: For the moment assuming that Mr Trevitt knows that Graham is faking it, when he puts his hand upon Mr Trevitt’s shoulder, that is by definition an assault is it not? Whether it goes anywhere is another matter, but that has to be an assault? 
         
         
        WEINSTEIN: No your Honour with respect no that’s not right. It may in certain circumstances be a battery but when he touches him, that -- 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Because there’s no apprehension as to fear?  
        
       
       
        
        WEINSTEIN: The apprehension as to fear -- 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: So he’s got to believe -- 
        
       
       
        
        WEINSTEIN: Indeed, it’s not just an apprehension of fear, it is an imminent apprehension of physical contact or fear.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: So there’s no assault unless he then believes that he is going to be subjected to some physical violence. 
        
       
       
        
        WEINSTEIN: That’s correct. I think my friend and I are at one about that. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: So the belief is fundamental to the assault, as it is to everything else. 
        
       
       
        
        WEINSTEIN: Absolutely. Quite your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: The nervous shock claim is pleaded by reference to as it were that which constitutes the false imprisonment, not that which constitutes the semi exercise, is that not the case Mr Eburn, so if I were to find that the exercises were singularly stupid and unauthorised and so forth, that would assist you not one bit. I have to find a false imprisonment or an assault or a battery to found the nervous shock action. Or is it sufficient for the nervous shock action that there’s a role play with or without consent, whether anything happens in it? 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: Yes your Honour, I mean the whole – the role play, the false imprisonment, the case is pleaded in the alternatives I would have submitted your Honour, assault, false imprisonment, negligence, and one of them would be sufficient to establish the causal link between what happened -- 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Right but let’s assume that the nervous shock action is substantially irrelevant if there’s assault and false imprisonment, because it’s an overlap, and if there isn’t it’s – an overlap, you’ve already got up on those two so it doesn’t really make much difference. On the other hand, if you fail on those two, they don’t do you any help on the nervous shock action, so relevantly the nervous shock action is only that which is neither an assault nor a false imprisonment, in order for it to go anywhere. 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: I must confess I’m not following you your Honour. By the nervous shock action, do you mean an action in negligence? 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Yes. You have three separate causes of action do you not? 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: Yes, and our submission is that the damage, namely the psychological injury that flowed from any – or all of them. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well they overlap. 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: So deleting that which is the overlap, because it’s irrelevant, you either win or lose on both points. Delete the assault, delete the false imprisonment. 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: So that all that is left is the negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: So the only thing you’re left with is the negligence. The nervous shock action is then confined exclusively to that which does not constitute either assault or false imprisonment, because it’s either a double dip or a double failure, so put it to one side. Then it is particularised in respect of 7 through 10, and that alone, is that right? And the weapons are either assault and imprisonment or nothing. 
        
       
       
        
        EBURN: Yes. 
        
       
     60 That passage of the argument might be summarised as follows. Counsel for the defendants accepted that the acts commencing with the placing of Graham’s hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder might in certain circumstances be a battery, but not an assault, because there was not an imminent apprehension of violence. He said he and counsel for the plaintiff were at one about that. Counsel for the plaintiff did not deny that. The trial judge said that belief in imminent subjection to some physical violence was “fundamental to the assault, as it is to everything else.” Counsel for the defendants agreed and counsel for the plaintiff did not indicate dissent. The trial judge then raised the topic of whether it was necessary to find false imprisonment, assault or battery to found the nervous shock action, or whether the role play alone sufficed. Counsel for the plaintiff said that the causal link could be established by assault, false imprisonment or negligence – but did not mention battery. Thereafter the debate proceeded on the assumption that there were only three causes of action under consideration – assault, false imprisonment and negligence – and on the further assumption that at least the assault and false imprisonment claims depended on a fear of subjection to physical violence. A tort of battery does not depend on the existence of any fear of that kind. Hence, though the defendants did not before this Court rely on the passages just discussed, it would appear that any claim in battery was abandoned by the plaintiff, and the trial judge was correct to say “that is not the plaintiff’s claim”. 
     61 If there was a tortious battery on which the plaintiff is entitled to rely, the question arises of what damages should be awarded. The trial judge’s assessment of $1 was correct. The trial judge found that the plaintiff only believed in the reality of the hold-up for a brief instant. That instant had passed by the time of the assumed battery. The trial judge found that the plaintiff had no apprehension of any imminent harmful or offensive contact. There is no finding that the physical contact was anything other than utterly trivial except to the extent that the weight of the metal on the plaintiff’s skull was uncomfortable. As soon as the plaintiff experienced that sensation, he pushed the metal away from his skull. While a plaintiff complaining of a battery is entitled to recover damages for injured feelings, distress and affront to his dignity, those consequences must flow from the battery, and not from non- tortious behaviour. The plaintiff has not demonstrated that his injured feelings, his distress, and the affront to his dignity, flowed from the battery, as distinct from other aspects of the exercise that took place. In any event, even apart from that circumstance, the assessment of the trial judge, which, apart from the factors mentioned above, was based on what she correctly described as “the defendants’ unqualified apologies when complaint was made”, appears entirely sound.  
      
      [Submissions ensued on costs] 
     62 MASON P: Since the Court has been unable to agree on the costs issues I invite Hodgson JA to deliver the first judgment. 
     63 HODGSON JA: It has been drawn to the Court’s attention in relation to costs that the defendant made offers of settlement prior to the hearing at first instance: firstly, an offer made on 19 June 2000 of $20,000 inclusive of costs; and secondly, an offer made on 31 July 2000 of $32,000 plus costs. Apart from the making of those offers, the result as to costs in the District Court, had the District Court given the decision that this Court has given, would in all probability have been that each party pay its own costs of the District Court proceedings. The offers would probably have meant that the appropriate order in the District Court would have been that each party pay its own costs until the making of the first of those offers, and that the appellant pay the respondents’ costs thereafter. 
     64 There is authority to the effect that, in relation to offers of compromise in the Supreme Court no new offer of compromise is required to entitle the party making the offer to have the benefit of it in relation to appeals: Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press (1995) 38 NSWLR 404. That decision does not apply in terms to this situation, which does not relate to a formal offer of compromise but rather a settlement offer by letter. 
     65 In my opinion, the Court has some discretion in relation to the question of costs of the appeal notwithstanding the offers by letter. No new offer was made after the judgment, and the plaintiff was left in a situation where he had, not only a decision against him, but an order that he pay the whole of the costs of the proceedings. The plaintiff could challenge that order only by appealing, and as I have said no further offer was made which in any way could have alleviated the plaintiff’s situation. In my opinion, it would be appropriate to make an order having the effect that the appellant get some or all of the costs of the appeal. Both parties at the appeal have been represented by senior counsel, and it may be that the costs of the hearing of the appeal would not be less than the costs of the hearing at first instance and may well have exceeded it. 
     66 It seems to me that the Court has the alternative of making costs orders to some extent favourable to one party and to some extent favourable to the other, and setting them off, or making an order that each party bear its own costs of the whole proceedings and of the appeal. I think there are practical considerations favouring the latter course and that is the course which I favour. I would propose the following costs order. Each party to bear its own costs of the proceedings and of the appeal, and also an order that the costs order made by the primary judge be set aside. 
     67 MASON P: I agree with those orders although my reasons are slightly different. To my mind the pre trial Calderbank offer carries very little continuing weight in the exercise of judicial discretion as regards the costs of the appeal. But the reason why I would not give the appellant his full costs of the appeal lie rather in the fact that the appellant has achieved comparatively little in the appeal compared to what he was seeking; and secondly, in the fact that it is appropriate to set off whatever costs rights apply in the appeal against the costs orders that ought to be made as regards the trial. Looking at the trial situation I think there is every reason to enforce the rules with respect to Calderbank offers and that clearly establishes a notional credit in the State’s favour. Having regard to the impracticalities of calculating and setting off the costs and the broadly discretionary nature of the exercise in which we are presently engaged I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA. 
     68 HEYDON JA: I disagree with the orders proposed as to the costs of the trial. I agree with the orders proposed by the defendants. The first of these was that the plaintiff would get no costs up to the date of the offer but that the defendants would not be liable for any. The defendants could have asked for more in my opinion but they did not. The second order which the defendants wanted was indemnity costs from the date of the first letter. 
     69 As to the costs of the appeal, in my opinion the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs. The appeal, if it were to have any prospect of substantial success beyond that which it has achieved, which is slight, would have to have overturned credit based findings of the trial judge. This was, in the circumstances of this case, a near impossible task. The appellant who wishes to launch an appeal to recover a sum as low as $2,000.00 should pay the costs of that appeal unless significantly greater success was likely. Hence, in my opinion, the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs of the appeal. 
     70 MASON P: The order of the Court by majority are those proposed by Hodgson JA. 
     71 HODGSON JA: The orders of the Court are: 
      
      1. Appeal allowed with costs. 
       
      2. Set aside judgment for the respondents and the costs order in their favour. 
       
      3. Judgment for the appellant against each respondent for $2,000.00. 
       
      4. Order that each party bear its own costs of the proceedings and the appeal.

     R v. Mahmoud ZREIKAJudgment1 HODGSON JA: On 8th November 2000, the appellant was convicted on four counts of receiving a motor vehicle knowing when he did so it was stolen, after a trial before Naughton DCJ which lasted thirteen days. 2 On 21st January 2001, the trial judge sentenced the appellant. On one of the four charges, he sentenced the appellant to one and a half years' imprisonment commencing on 8th November 2000 and expiring on 7th May 2002; and on each of the other three charges, he sentenced the appellant to two years' imprisonment to be served concurrently, commencing on 8th May 2002 and expiring on 7th May 2004. In relation to the latter sentence, the trial judge set a non-parole period of one and a half years expiring on 7th November 2003. 3 The appellant appeals from his conviction and seeks leave to appeal from his sentence. 4 There were four motor vehicles involved in the charges against the appellant. In relation to each motor vehicle, the appellant faced three charges: stealing (Crimes Act 1900, s.154AA); receiving the motor vehicle knowing when he did so it was stolen (Crimes Act 1900, s.188); and disposing of the motor vehicle knowing when he did so it was stolen (Crimes Act 1900, s.188). The second of those charges in relation to each motor vehicle was brought as an alternative to the first of them, and the third charge was brought as an alternative to the second charge. In relation to each motor vehicle, the jury found the appellant not guilty on the stealing charge and guilty on the receiving charge. The guilty verdict on the receiving charges satisfied the charges of disposing. 5 In essence, the appellant's defence at the trial was that he did not know the vehicles were stolen, and he gave evidence at the trial in which he offered explanations of his possession of the vehicles. The first ground of the appeal against conviction relates to directions given by the trial judge in relation to these explanations. The second ground relates to alleged unfairly prejudicial remarks and opinions expressed by the trial judge in summing up to the jury. 6 Before looking at the grounds of appeal and submissions in more detail, it is convenient to set out an outline of the history in relation to each of the four cars which was supported by convincing evidence at the trial, not the subject of any significant contest at the trial, and not in any way challenged on the appeal; and then to set out the substance of the explanation given by the appellant in relation to each vehicle. 7 The first vehicle, in relation to which the first three charges were brought, was a green 1987 Ford Fairlane sedan registered number ABU 47A. 8 On 24th July 1995, the appellant purchased at an auction a written-off vehicle of the same colour, make and model, which then had registration number QEP 737, for $4,800.00 cash. 9 On 25th October 1995, the vehicle the subject of the charges was stolen from a Mr. Cadefski. 10 On 22nd December 1995, the appellant obtained registration, under registration number QNQ 989, of a vehicle of the same colour, make and model. The registration papers provided by the appellant showed an engine and chassis number identical to those of the stolen vehicle. The inspection report submitted by the appellant showed that the vehicle was in reasonable condition, with an odometer reading of 102,358km. 11 On 16th January 1996, following an advertisement in the Trading Post, the appellant sold a green Ford Fairlane registered number QNQ 989 to one Mr. Newing for $11,000.00 cash. 12 Later, this vehicle sold to Mr. Newing was identified by Mr. and Mrs. Cadefski as the stolen vehicle, and the previous owner of the written-off vehicle purchased by the appellant at auction said that for a number of reasons this vehicle was not his vehicle. A crime scene examiner gave evidence that the original engine and chassis number of the stolen vehicle had been altered so as to appear to be those of the written-off vehicle. 13 The second motor vehicle, the subject of the fourth to sixth charges, was a blue 1996 Holden Commodore sedan registered number QTF 967. 14 On 5th March 1997, the appellant purchased a written-off vehicle of the same colour, make and model, then registered number OEA 261, at an auction for $12,000.00 cash. 15 On 25th or 26th March 1997, the subject vehicle was stolen from Mobil Oil Pty. Limited. 16 On 27th March 1997, the appellant obtained registration under registration number QWH 562 for a vehicle of the same colour, make and model. The inspection report presented by the appellant in applying for registration showed that the vehicle was in apparently sound condition, with an odometer reading 5,190km. 17 On 24th April 1997, the appellant sold the vehicle QWH 562 for $24,000.00. There was expert evidence that this vehicle had the engine and identification and compliance plates from vehicle QTF 967, and the vehicle was clearly identified as being the vehicle stolen from Mobil. 18 The third motor vehicle, the subject of the seventh to ninth charges, was a blue 1996 Holden Berlina sedan registered number AEG 43G. 19 On 27th June 1997, the appellant purchased a written-off 1996 blue Commodore registered number UFQ 328 at an auction for $7,000.00 cash. 20 On 2nd or 3rd July 1997, the vehicle the subject of the charges was stolen from a Mr. Horrell. 21 On 9th July 1997, the appellant presented papers in support of an application for registration of what was described as a ""Commodore Berlina"" with a claimed market value of $17,000.00, together with an inspection report showing the vehicle in apparently sound condition and with odometer reading 19,674km. This vehicle was registered under the registration number UNB 608. 22 On 22nd August 1997, the appellant sold the vehicle UNB 608 for $25,000.00. 23 Expert evidence showed that the vehicle sold by the appellant had the engine and identification and compliance plates from UFQ 328. Other evidence showed that the vehicle was not the vehicle UFQ 328, and it was identified by Mr. Horrell as being the vehicle stolen from him. 24 The fourth vehicle the subject of the tenth to twelfth charges, was a white 1996 Holden Berlina sedan registered number UGJ 220. 25 This vehicle was stolen from Canterbury/Hurlstone Park RSL Club on 24th or 25th May 1997. 26 On 27th June 1997, the appellant purchased a written-off white Holden Commodore sedan registered number QSY 846 at an auction for $9,800.00. 27 On 30th September 1997, the appellant presented to the RTA registration papers for what was described as a ""VS Holden Commodore Berlina"" with a claimed market value of $19,000.00. The appellant also provided an inspection report stating the vehicle was in apparently sound condition and with odometer reading 6,400km. The vehicle was registered under registration number URN 904. 28 On 2nd or 3rd October 1997, the appellant sold the vehicle URN 904 for $24,000.00. 29 Expert evidence showed that this vehicle had the engine and identification and compliance plates from the vehicle QSY 846. The evidence also showed that this vehicle was not in fact the vehicle QSY 846. It was identified by Mr. Thomas from the Canterbury/Hurlstone Park RSL Club as being the vehicle stolen from that club. 30 The appellant's evidence in relation to these vehicles was to the following effect.31 In relation to the first vehicle, he went to the auction with his friend Ahmed Katiah. Mr. Katiah did the bidding, provided the money, and the vehicle was taken to Mr. Katiah's workshop. Subsequently, Mr. Katiah telephoned the appellant, said the car was fixed, and asked the appellant to register the vehicle in the appellant's name because Mr. Katiah had too many cars in his name. Mr. Katiah then asked the appellant to sell the car for him and give the proceeds to Mr. Katiah. The appellant did so and received $300.00 for selling the car. In relation to this vehicle, as in relation to all four vehicles, the appellant denied stealing it and denied ever knowing it was stolen. 32 In relation to the second vehicle, the appellant said that he went to the auction with his nephew Tony Yaghi, who was a panel beater, and who was helping him to buy a car. His nephew lent him the $12,000.00 with which he purchased the car. He then took the car to a repairer Ahmed Metar. Mr. Metar repaired the car, and provided documents for registration, and the appellant paid Mr. Metar $8,000.00 for carrying out this repair. 33 In relation to the third and fourth vehicles, the appellant said that he went to the auction by himself. After buying the car, he took it to Ahmed Metar for repair, and subsequently paid Mr. Metar for the repairs, the sum of $12,000.00 in relation to the third vehicle, and $9,000.00 in relation to the fourth vehicle. 34 In the case of the second, third and fourth vehicles, the appellant admitted lying to the purchaser of each vehicle about the history of the vehicle, in order to mislead the purchaser and obtain a satisfactory sale of the vehicle. \35 The first ground of the appeal against conviction was that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the question of recent possession. 36 In support of this ground, Mr. Patch for the appellant referred the Court to a number of passages in the summing up by the trial judge, including the following passage:  
      
       
        
         
         If an accused person has property in his possession which has recently been stolen and he either gives no explanation as to how he came to have it, or gives an explanation which you are satisfied could not reasonably be true, then you are entitled to take that into account in determining whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused stole that property or that he received it believing it to have been stolen. 
          
         
        
       
     37 A little later, the trial judge noted in his summing up that the appellant had sought to give explanations, and he continued:  
      
       
        
         
         It is a question for you as to whether you accept them as being reasonable explanations. ... If you consider that an explanation was called for from the accused and that he has not given one, that is, not given an explanation or a reasonable explanation for his possession of the stolen goods, you can take that into account against the accused and weigh it up in the light of the whole of the evidence in deciding whether the Crown has proved its case against the accused. 
          
         
        
       
     38 Mr. Patch submitted that this in effect reversed the onus of proof. At the very least, he submitted, the trial judge should have said, after the words ""it is a question for you as to whether you accept those explanations"", further words such as ""or regard them as being reasonably possible"". In substance, the trial judge told the jury that they could take the appellant's explanation into account in the appellant's favour only if in fact they accepted it. 39 Mr. Patch further submitted that it was an error to say that the failure of the accused to give an explanation can be taken into account: what the trial judge should have said was that ""if the accused does given an explanation which you cannot dismiss beyond reasonable doubt, then you should not convict on the basis of recent possession"". 40 In support of that submission, Mr. Patch referred to the case of Bellamy (1983) 3 A Crim R 432. He noted that, at 437, Street CJ said that ""It is enough if [the jury] thinks that the explanation may reasonably be true"" for the jury not to be able to convict ""merely on the basis of possession of recently-stolen property"". He referred also to passages in the judgment of Reynolds JA, including the following at 438:  
      
       
        
         
         If the jury is left in doubt, that is, they think the explanation may be true, then ... the accused is entitled to an acquittal.  
          
         
        
       
     41 Mr. Patch also referred to Richards (1987) 34 A Crim R 407, in which Bellamy was followed. 42 Mr. Patch submitted that the trial judge's direction erroneously suggested to the jury that the accused had the onus to provide an explanation, because otherwise, how could the jury take into account the accused's failure to give an explanation or give a reasonable explanation? 43 Mr. Patch pointed out that both the defence and the Crown sought a re-direction on this matter. Mr. Patch submitted that this shows how the matter was perceived, on both sides, in the courtroom dynamics at the time. 44 Mr. Patch also submitted that in relation to the fourth vehicle, there was a delay of over four months between the time when the vehicle was stolen and the time when it was shown to be in the appellant's possession. Mr. Patch submitted that that was too long a period for the possession to count as the possession of property recently stolen, so that the direction in relation to that matter should not have been given in relation to that charge. 45 In my opinion, it was not an error for the trial judge to have directed the jury to the effect that, if they were satisfied that the appellant's explanation could not reasonably be true, they could take into account the recent possession and their view of the explanation as matters tending to support a finding of guilty. In my opinion, to give a direction in those terms is not a reversal of the onus of proof. Certain of the passages in the summing up, highlighted by Mr. Patch, could, if read in isolation, suggest that the jury was entitled to take recent possession into account in support of a finding of guilt if they did not accept the appellant's explanations as reasonable explanations, as distinct from being satisfied that the explanations could not reasonably be true. However, in my opinion a fair reading of the whole summing up indicates that the jury would not have been left with the impression that they could find the appellant guilty, on the basis of recent possession alone, even if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant's explanations could not possibly be true. 46 In some cases, it will be desirable for a trial judge to squarely put to the jury that, if they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's explanation is false or if they think the explanation is reasonably possible, then they cannot convict merely on the basis of possession of recently stolen property. That direction would often be appropriate if the only evidence of guilt, or the main evidence of guilt, is possession of recently-stolen property. On the other hand, if the possession of recently-stolen property is only one small element in the Crown case, and is not an essential link in a chain of Crown evidence but rather one independent support of a case having other independent support, then it may be confusing for a jury to put the matter to them in those terms. 47 In the present case, the evidence of guilt went far beyond possession of recently-stolen property, and amounted to an extremely strong circumstantial case based on many elements. The ultimate question for decision by the jury was not whether the appellant's story was reasonably possible, but whether on the whole of the circumstances of the case they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the property was stolen. The plausibility of the appellant's explanation was only one factor going to this question. The trial judge made it abundantly clear that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the property was stolen. 48 Without attempting to be exhaustive as to the circumstantial case against the appellant, independently of possession of property recently stolen, I note that the evidence showed four separate occasions when a car, similar to a written-off vehicle purchased by the appellant, was stolen at around the time of the purchase by the appellant: in the case of the first vehicle, it was stolen three months after the purchase; in the case of the second vehicle, it was stolen three weeks after the purchase by the appellant; in the case of the third vehicle, it was stolen one week after the purchase by the appellant; and in the case of the vehicle, it was stolen one month earlier than the purchase by the appellant. On each of these four occasions, the stolen car was substituted for the car purchased by the appellant, with its identification being altered to that of the written-off car purchased by the appellant and, on three occasions, with the engine substituted. The appellant then sold this vehicle shortly afterwards, having obtained a new registration number for it. On each of these four occasions, the written-off car had a severely damaged body, whereas the car sold by the appellant had an undamaged body, which the appellant claimed he believed to be the result of repairs made to the written-off vehicle. 49 Having regard to the strength of the inference of knowledge that each vehicle was stolen that arises from these circumstances, and the further details of them appearing in the evidence, it is my opinion that it was not necessary for the trial judge to give a specific direction that, if they thought the appellant's explanation was reasonably possible, then it was not open to them to convict merely upon the basis of possession of recently-stolen property. It was never the Crown's case that the appellant should be convicted merely upon the basis of possession of recently-stolen property. 50 Accordingly, I do not think a case of misdirection has been made out on this basis. In coming to that view, I take into account the submission concerning the request for redirection at the trial, although I note that the Crown's acquiescence in the appellant's request for redirection was explicitly made out of an abundance of caution. 51 As regards the other submission, that it was inappropriate to give a direction in relation to possession of property recently stolen when the possession was over four months after the stealing, I accept the submission made by Mr. Dawe QC for the Crown based on certain passages in the judgment in R v. Sinanovic [2000] NSWCCA 395, at pars.25-26. After referring to R v. Smail (unreported CCA 15th August 1986) Hulme J expressed the view that, having regard to the basis of the doctrine, namely the unexplained fact of possession, and having regard to the nature of the property, the doctrine could properly be applied in that case where the time between the stealing and possession was as much as seven months. I accept that Mr. Dawe's submission that there is no hard and fast line that can be drawn as to what would constitute possession of property recently stolen, that it depends on the circumstances of the case, and that it could not be concluded that in this case the period of just over four months was too long for the possession to count as ""recent"". 52 The second ground of appeal against conviction was that there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the unfairly prejudicial remarks and personal opinions expressed by the trial judge in his summing up to the jury. 53 Mr. Patch submitted that, at several points during the summing up, the trial judge made sarcastic and unfairly prejudicial remarks that made it patently obvious that he did not believe the accused. He submitted that the cumulative effect of these remarks must have been very strong. The remarks included the following four excerpts from the summing up:  
      
       
        
         
         SU85: ""Your may think ladies and gentlemen - it is a matter entirely for yourselves - that this was a very sophisticated and a very clever operation and not by someone who was the unsuspecting, ignorant person whom you might think it was the intention of the accused to put himself forward as. But this is a matter for you to determine."" 
          
         SU100: ""As to the accused saying that he did not know anything about the cars you might think, ladies and gentlemen, that he knew a hell of a lot about how to buy them, how to have them cheaply repaired, how to re-register them, how to advertise them cleverly, how to sell them cleverly by even telling the prospective purchaser ""I'll just go and check with my wife"" to make the purchaser think that he really was fair dinkum and bona fide and genuine, You might think that he was very clever in those respects. He certainly seemed to have fooled four not unintelligent purchasers. It is a matter for you to determine whether this was a clever and highly sophisticated theft operation and ""re-birth"" operation. That is a matter which you have to decide."" 
          
         SU102: (in reference to the fact that no car remains were found at the accused's premises) ""You might think, ladies and gentlemen, that this is just an indicator of the man's efficiency and that an efficient operator in that type of field would get rid of incriminating evidence as soon as he possibly could."" 
          
         SU104: ""There is one particular question you might think was significant that was asked shortly half way through his evidence. He was asked in chief by Mr. D'Arbon....""When you took possession of the repaired car on the day you went to the registry did you know that the car was in fact a re-birthed stolen car?"" Answer, ""No, not at all."" 
          
         You might ask yourselves is that the sort of answer you would get from someone who knew nothing about these sort of procedures. You might think would he not have said what does ""re-birthing"" mean, but he did not do that, he just said straight away ""no, not at all."" It is one of the matters you might take into account."" 
          
         
        
       
     54 Mr. Patch submitted that the last comment was also illogical, because, by the time of the trial, the accused would have been well aware of the meaning ""re-birthing"", because it was part of the Crown case. 55 Mr. Patch referred to the cases of Courtney-Smith (1990) 48 A Crim R 49, R v Machin (1996) 68 SASR 526, and R v Sinanovic [2000] NSWCCA 396, at pars.129-139. He submitted that in this case, as in Machin and Sinanovic, the credibility of the appellant was crucial and the comments of the trial judge, conveying forcefully that he disbelieved the appellant, must have worked very much and unfairly to the prejudice of the appellant. As noted in those cases, it was not sufficient to tell the jury that they should disregard the judge's comments unless they happened to coincide with their own views. 56 I note that no objection was taken to these aspects of the summing up at the trial, so according to r.4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, the leave of the Court is required before this ground can be relied on. As stated in R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81, leave should be granted only if the appellant satisfies the Court that the omission to raise the objection has led to a miscarriage of justice. Having regard to the nature of the comments, their place in a long summing up, the clarity with which the trial judge made it clear to the jury that they should disregard any view of the facts expressed by him unless it coincided with their own view, the circumstance that no objection was taken at the trial, the strength of the Crown case, and the circumstance that the appellant admitted to the jury that he told lies about the motor vehicles to purchasers in order to mislead them about the history of the motor vehicles and induce them to purchase the vehicles, I am far from satisfied that there has been a miscarriage by reason of the comments complained about. Indeed, I am affirmatively satisfied there has been no miscarriage. Accordingly, I would not grant leave to rely on this ground. 57 I would add that in any event I am not satisfied that the stringent approach to these questions supported by Machin, but questioned by subsequent cases in South Australia, is good law in New South Wales. With the possible exception of the last comment, I do not believe in the particular circumstances of this case, the comments transgress even the more stringent approach of Machin. There is some force in the criticism of the last comment; but in my view, this one illogical comment on the facts in the long summing up would not in any event justify allowing an appeal. 58 Turning to the application for leave to appeal from the sentence imposed, ground 1 of this application was that the trial judge erred in not considering whether there were ""special circumstances"" in the meaning of s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; and ground 2 was that the trial judge erred in not finding that there were such ""special circumstances"". 59 Mr. Patch pointed out that, because the judge adopted a non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence in relation to the two year sentence on the counts concerning vehicles two, three and four, the effect of the totality of the sentence was that the total period during which the appellant was ineligible for parole was six-sevenths of the total of the sentences. The circumstance that the period of imprisonment, in relation to which a non-parole period was set, was accumulated on an earlier sentence, so that the period during which the appellant would not be entitled to parole was extended, was one which could amount to a special circumstance: see R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114; Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R at 61; Close (1992) 65 A Crim R 55 at 60; Bidner, NSWCCA, file numbers 60307/91 and 60330/92; R v Bo Too & Maiereriki, NSWCCA BC9201742 16/7/92. The sentencing judge expressly found there were not special circumstances, but the failure to advert to the disproportion resulting from the accumulation of sentences and the gross disproportion itself showed that the judge had not considered these matters which could amount to special circumstances, and had erred in not finding special circumstances and fixing an effective non-parole period more proportionate to the total sentence. Particularly was this so, Mr. Patch submitted, when there was a normal practice of setting the non-parole period at three-quarters of the head sentence, unless there was some justification for departing from this. 60 Of course, as conceded by Mr. Patch, there is no rule requiring justification for departure upwards from an effective non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence. Furthermore, the discrepancy between an effective non-parole period of three-quarters, as is quite usual, and an effective non-parole period of six-sevenths, as in this case, is not a large difference. The failure expressly to refer to the possibility that the accumulation of sentences could amount to special circumstances is not a conclusive indication that the sentencing judge did not consider this, particularly where there were no factors suggesting that the appellant would be assisted by a lengthy period of parole. Sentencing judges are not required to refer explicitly to every matter which they take into account or decide not to give effect to. 61 Accordingly, I would not grant leave to appeal on this ground. 62 Ground 3 of the sentence application was that the trial judge erred in not making all sentences concurrent. 63 Mr. Patch submitted that the acts for which the applicant were sentenced were all part of the same related series of events, considered by the sentencing judgte as part of a carefully and cleverly organised scheme; and so the sentences should have been concurrent. 64 In my opinion, the circumstance that one count related to events in 1995 and early 1996, and the other counts all related to events occurring in 1997, was sufficient to justify the course taken by the sentencing judge in his discretion. In my view also, the totality of the sentence was entirely appropriate. 65 Ground 4 of the application in relation to sentence was that the trial judge erred in taking into account the fact that the Court file disclosed that the appellant had appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal before he was sentenced. 66 Mr. Patch referred to a remark where the sentencing judge is recorded as saying to the effect that the appellant had not shown any contrition, repentance, or remorse, and went on to say that on the contrary, he had remained defiant, and filed an appeal against conviction. It was an error, Mr. Patch submitted, to take into account the matter of appeal and the appellant remaining defiant as matters of aggravation. 67 In my opinion, the reference to an appeal having been lodged was only made in the context of matters negativing contrition, repentance, and remorse on the part of the appellant, and was not in any way taken into account as a matter of aggravation. It was appropriate for the sentencing judge to take into account the lack of contrition, repentance, and remorse shown by the appellant. 68 Ground 5 of the application in relation to sentence was that the appellant was sentenced on the basis that he was involved in the theft of the motor vehicles, even though he had been acquitted of all stealing charges. 69 Mr. Patch pointed to the remarks of the sentencing judge as follows: ""I find that the offender had a significant part in the overall scheme of theft, alteration and re-sale. His criminality was of a high order."" Mr. Patch submitted that it was not open to the sentencing judge to take into account aggravating circumstances covered by charges in an indictment in respect of which the person had been found not guilty by the jury, in the same way as the judge could not take into account aggravating circumstances not charged in the indictment: see Kingswell (1985) 19 A Crim R 65, and De Simoni (1980-81) 147 CLR 383.70 In my opinion, as submitted by Mr. Dawe, the remarks did not indicate that the sentencing judge was impermissibly elevating the criminality of the appellant to that of a thief, but rather elaborated on the character of the receiving of which the appellant had been found guilty. 71 For these reasons, I propose the following orders: 1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
       
        
       2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence dismissed. 
        
       
     72 DOWD J: I have read the judgment of Hodgson JA in draft form. I agree with the orders proposed, and with his Honour's reasons. 73 CARRUTHERS AJ: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment in draft form of Hodgson JA. I agree with the orders which he proposes, and his reasons therefore. 74 I wish however to add certain comments of my own in relation to the second ground of appeal, namely, that there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of the unfairly prejudicial remarks and personal opinions expressed by the trial judge in his summing up to the jury. 75 The relevant facts, so far as this ground is concerned, are set out in the judgment of Hodgson JA and I gratefully adopt what his Honour has said in that respect, and I agree that leave to appeal on this ground should be refused for the reasons set out by his Honour. 76 Effectively this ground is one that the trial judge was guilty of perceived bias in his summing up. 77 This is a serious accusation to make against a trial judge. There is an additional element of seriousness in that counsel for the appellant at the trial did not object to any of the statements which are now impugned and sought no correction or redirection in that regard. There can be no suggestion that this was an oversight on the part of defence counsel, who conducted the trial with skill and resolution. So much is evident from the transcript. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules requires therefore that the leave of this Court is required for reliance by the appellant on this ground. 78 In both written and oral submissions, counsel for the appellant (who was not counsel at the trial) made a stinging attack upon the conduct of the trial judge. The written submissions contend that:  
      
       
        
         
         At several points during the summing-up, the trail (sic) judge made sarcastic and unfairly prejudicial remarks which made it patently obvious that he did not believe the accused. 
          
         
        
       
     79 The leading authorities in this area were considered recently by Hulme J in R v Sinanovic [2000] NSWCCA 396 at paras 77-86. It is not necessary therefore for me to refer in detail to the well known authorities in this field of the law. 80 The law was concisely stated by this Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P, and Lusher AJ) in R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 at 56: -  
      
       
        
         
         The trial judge is entitled to express opinions on the facts provided he or she makes it clear to the jury that it is exclusively their function to decide factual disputes... The mere incantation of the jury's role in resolving factual disputes will not repair an unfair-unbalanced intrusion by the judge into discussion of the facts. But it is not the law that the judge may make no observation on the facts. 
          
         
        
       
     81 Necessarily, questions of fact and degree arise here, as well as changing perceptions of fairness. Views must necessarily differ as to what is ""an unfair-unbalanced intrusion by the judge into discussion of the facts"". 82 It does appear that the number of cases in which criticism of the trial judge's comments in relation to factual matters is increasing and there is an increasing readiness on the part of appellants to raise this ground irrespective of whether objection was taken at first instance or not. 83 This increasing degree of criticism arises in the context that the nature of a criminal trial in this day and age is demanding and imposes considerable pressure on trial judges who in most cases are dealing with complex questions of law and procedure as well as not infrequently complex evidentiary matters, particularly where scientific evidence has been led and challenged. 84 The question of how far judges may go in expressing views regarding the evidence during the course of a criminal trial is probably as old as the judicial process itself. It is now some 400 years since Sir Francis Bacon uttered the well known aphorism that ""an overspeaking judge is no well-tuned cymbal"". But, as McReynolds J pointed out in his dissenting judgment in Berger v United States (1921) 255 U.S. 22 at 43: -  
      
       
        
         
         And while 'an overspeaking judge is not well-tuned cymbal' neither is an amorphous dummy unspotted by human emotions a becoming receptacle for judicial power. 
          
         
        
       
     85 In Peter George Sparrow (1973) 57 Cr App R 352, the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) was concerned with, on appeal of a murder case, whether the trial judge's comment on the failure of the accused to give evidence (which comment was made in one form or another on 6 occasions) exceeded the grounds of what was permissible such as to create a miscarriage of justice. In rejecting the appeal, Lawton LJ, speaking on behalf of the Court, said (at 362-363): -  
      
       
        
         
         In the judgment of this Court, if the trial Judge had not commented in strong terms upon the appellant's absence from the witness-box, he would have been failing in his duty. The object of a summing-up is to help the jury and in our experience a jury is not helped by a colourless reading out of the evidence as recorded by the judge in his notebook. The Judge is more than a mere referee who takes no part in the trial save to intervene when a rule of procedure or evidence is broken.  
         He and the jury try the case together and it is his duty to give them the benefit of his knowledge of the law and to advise them in the light of his experience as to the significance of the evidence 
         ; and when an accused person elects not to give evidence, in most cases, but not all, the Judge should explain to the jury what the consequences of his absence from the witness-box are and if, in 
           
         his discretion, he thinks that he should do so more than once, he may; but he must keep in mind always his duty to be fair. 
         [my emphasis] 
          
         
        
       
     86 The passage in bold above is important. It rightly stresses the complementary role which the judge and jury play in the criminal trial process, and a judge's need to assist the jury (based on his or her experience) with regard to the significance of the evidence where such assistance is necessary. 87 The general problem under consideration was adverted to by the majority of the High Court (Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) in RPS v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 449 at 458, where their Honours said when dealing with judicial instructions in criminal trials: -  
      
       
        
         
         Before parting with the case, it is as well to say something more general about the difficult task trial judges have in giving juries proper instructions. The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes. In 
           
         some cases it will require the judge to warn the jury about how they should not reason or about particular care that must be shown before accepting certain kinds of evidence. 
          
         But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of the functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task. And, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues.  
         But although a trial judge may comment on the facts, the judge is not bound to do so except to the extent that the judge's other functions require it.  
         Often, perhaps much more often than not, the safer course for a trial judge will be to make no comment on the facts beyond reminding the jury, in the course of identifying the issues before them, of the arguments of counsel.  
         (my emphasis) 
          
         
        
       
     88 Some judges take the view that they should never comment in relation to the facts irrespective of how the matter is ultimately left for consideration by the jury. Other judges take a different view, and at times conclude that assistance by them would be appreciated by the jury in dealing with factual issues. The High Court still allows for that position consistently with well established authority. 89 Sometimes, and this is not uncommon in modern litigation, the jury may well be left in a state of confusion if all that is done by the trial judge is to remind them of the evidence in the course of identifying the issues before them of the arguments of counsel. 90 As Windeyer J expressed the matter in Jones v Dunkel (1959-60) 101 CLR 298 at 314:-  
      
       
        
         
         So much, too, depends upon the judge's view of what guidance the particular jury should have in the particular case; upon how far he may think it necessary to go over matters on which counsel addressed; or, on the other hand, on how far he may think he should bring into sharper focus matters which counsel blurred. And much depends on how far he may think it desirable, after advocacy is spent, to redress the balance. On top of all this, the summing up has to be given promptly at the conclusion of the trial, without the opportunity for careful composition which a reserved judgment may get. 
          
         
        
       
     91 I cannot stress too strongly that it is the function of trial counsel to raise with the judge any comments on factual matters made by the judge, which counsel responsibly considers to have extended beyond the bounds of fairness. The matter can then be dealt with by argument and if necessary, corrected by the trial judge. If the trial judge maintains the comment and conviction ensues, then a proper platform has been raised for the matter to be dealt with in this Court. It is not appropriate that complaints be gleaned from a meticulous reading of the transcript well after the conclusion of the trial by counsel whose task it is to seek and find what they believe to be points justifying an appeal. This syndrome has now become so common that it has attracted the appellation of ""an armchair appeal point"". It would also eliminate the necessity of this Court having to hear argument in relation to alleged unfairness by a trial judge who has never had the opportunity to reconsider the relevant comment at the appropriate time, namely, when it was made. 92 In my view this Court should necessarily look with some circumspection upon appeals based upon allegedly prejudicial remarks by the trial judge in the absence of objection being taken by counsel at the trial.

       REGINA v. MARTIN AULIFF 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 POWELL JA: The Appellant appeals from a conviction by a jury following a trial on indictment before Shillington DCJ. 
     2 In the indictment the Appellant was charged with three offences, they being: 
      
       
       1. that on or about 30 December 1998 at Sydney he did unlawfully cause to be taken by the complainant a stupefying drug, namely flunitrazepam, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, to have sexual intercourse without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
       
       2. that on 30 December, 1998, at Sydney, he did assault the complainant and that he, at the time of such assault, did commit an act of indecency on the complainant; and 
       
       
       3. that on 30 December, 1998, at Sydney, he did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant, knowing that she was not consenting. 
       
     3 At the conclusion of the trial the jury found the Appellant guilty of the offence charged in the first count, were unable to agree on the proper disposition of the offence charged in the second count, and found the accused not guilty of the offence charged in the third count of the indictment. The jury was then discharged without verdict on the second count and then the trial judge proceeded to sentence the Appellant in respect of the offence found proved. 
     4 Two grounds of appeal have been taken by the Appellant for the purpose of this appeal, they being: 
      
       
       (1) that in all the circumstances, the verdict of the jury on count 1 of the indictment was unreasonable or unsatisfactory or unsafe, in that the verdicts on counts 1 and 3 of the indictment were inconsistent. 
       
       
       (2) that in all the circumstances there has been a fundamental failure of procedure going to the root of the trial, by reason of the failure of the trial judge to make a formal order pursuant to s.54(b) of the Jury Act 1977 before permitting the jury to separate after inviting them to consider their verdicts. 
       
     5 The facts insofar as they were sought to be proved at the trial were that the complainant, who was a tourist and who had met the Appellant about a week prior to the offences said to have been committed, on 29 December 1998 went to a cinema in Darling Harbour with the Appellant, after which she and the Appellant went to a restaurant in Kings Cross for dinner. 
     6 The complainant had a glass of water with her meal and then went to the toilet twice at the restaurant, once during the meal and the second time when they moved to the bar area where she ordered a cup of tea. After her second trip to the toilet the complainant began to feel very weak and was unable to walk normally. Her evidence was that she told the Appellant she was feeling tired and asked him to take her to the place were she was then lodging. 
     7 The complainant’s evidence was that she recalled that, after they entered the Appellant’s car, she felt the Appellant stroking the inside of her thighs, but that she recalled nothing thereafter until 1.00 p.m. on the following day, when she awoke in her bed at her lodgings. When she awoke, so she said, the complainant felt weak and dizzy and noticed that her panty-liner was missing; she also noticed that her jewellery had been taken off, her contact lenses had been taken out and she was wearing a T-shirt. 
     8 There was evidence from the owner of the lodgings where the complainant was then staying, that in the early hours of the morning of 30 December 1998, having heard a noise she went to the room which was occupied by the complainant where she found the complainant slumped limply across her bed, with her clothing in a state of disarray: having done so she helped to remove the complainant’s clothing, then put her to bed. 
     9 On the following day, 31 December 1998, the complainant telephoned a friend who, having advised her to see a doctor, later took the complainant to see a doctor who then referred them to a hospital where certain tests were carried out. 
     10 The complainant and her friend then went to the Kings Cross Police Station where they spoke to Sen.Cst. Clark, who drove them to the Royal North Shore Hospital where the complainant was examined by a Dr. Humphrey the career medical officer then on call for that hospital’s Sexual Assault Unit. Dr. Humphrey then examined the complainant, who also made available to him her underpants and provided to him samples of her blood and urine. 
     11 When later examined, the complainant’s underpants were found to be stained with semen, which, when later subjected to DNA testing following the provision by the Appellant of a blood sample, was found to be the Appellants. 
     12 When analysed, the urine sample provided by the complainant was found to contain traces of 7-Aminoflunctrazepam – a breakdown product of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) – of oxazepam (Serepax) and of temazepam (Normison), each of those drugs being one of the benzodiazepine group of drugs, which group of drugs I understand to contain drugs commonly called tranquillisers, sedatives and hypnotics. Each of oxazepam and temazepam is on Schedule 4 of the Poisons List proclaimed under the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966, while flunitrazepam is on Schedule 8 of that List. A doctor’s prescription is needed to obtain each drug from a pharmacist. 
     13 On 3 January 1999 the Appellant was arrested and taken to Dee Why Police Station, where he was interviewed by Sen. Cst. Clark and Det. Barclay of Kings Cross Detectives, that interview not being electronically recorded as the Appellant declined to submit to an ERISP. According to Sen. Cst. Clark, the Appellant, during the course of that interview, said that, after he and the complainant had left the restaurant at Kings Cross, at the complainant’s request he drove to Clovelly, where sexual activity, involving digital penetration but not intercourse in the conventional sense, took place. 
     14 Later, in March 1999, the Appellant’s premises were searched pursuant to a search warrant. In the course of that search, the police officers took possession of (inter alia) a red dispensing vial containing a white emulsion, which emulsion, when later analysed, was found to contain flunitrazepam. 
     15 In due time the Appellant was indicted and brought to trial in October 2000. At trial, the appellant, while admitting that while he and the complainant were at Clovelly, sexual activity – but not extending to digital penetration – took place denied having committed any of the offences with which he stood charged. 
     16 The second ground of appeal which has been raised by the Appellant relates to what occurred on the second last day of the trial, after the learned trial judge had summed up to the jury. The relevant part of the transcript record is as follows: 
      
       
       “JURY RETIRED TO CONSIDER ITS VERDICT AT 3.08 PM. 
        
       HIS HONOUR: Mr. Stratton, I will continue your client’s bail; he must remain within the building. 
        
       SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
        
       JURY RETURNED TO COURT AT 4.03 PM 
        
       HIS HONOUR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I have your note in which you seek to break off now and continue tomorrow. Now there is not (sic) problem about that. 
        
       HIS HONOUR CAUTIONED THE JURY NOT TO DISCUSS THE TRIAL OUTSIDE JURY ROOM 
        
       I will not be asking you to come back to court tomorrow morning. What I want you to do, if you would, is to go directly to the jury room and simply continue with your deliberations and the exhibits will be available out there. If you want to start a little earlier than 10 o’clock, that is a matter for you. 
        
       Mr. Foreman, is there a consensus among you that you should perhaps start at 9.30 rather than 10 o’clock? 
        
       In that case I will ask you all to be at the jury room at 9.30 in the morning to then continue. If you would now leave, thank you.” 
       
     17 The first ground of appeal taken on behalf of the Appellant seeks to persuade the Court that the verdict by the jury in relation to the third count was logically inconsistent with the verdict of the jury on the first count. 
     18 In this regard it should perhaps be noted, first, that the complainant was able to give no evidence whatsoever as to what was alleged to have occurred between herself and the accused shortly after they entered the Appellant’s car, and that the only evidence that was available to support that count was the conversation said to have taken place at the Dee Why police station when the accused was interviewed by the police officers. 
     19 Not surprisingly, in relation to that count the learned trial judge, on two occasions, gave a very strong McKinney direction, which direction, in my view, was thoroughly justified in the circumstances. That being so, it is hardly surprising that the jury was not prepared to find the Appellant guilty of the third offence with which he was charged. 
     20 But the fact that the jury was not prepared to find the accused guilty of that offence is, in my view, in no way inconsistent with the verdict of the jury on the first count. 
     21 The evidence which was before the jury included evidence to the effect that, on a number of occasions prior to 29 December 1998, the Appellant had made amorous advances to the complainant, which advances had been repelled. 
     22 Further, there was the evidence of the results of the DNA tests, and of the analyses of the sample of the complainant’s urine which had been carried out; the evidence that the drugs, of which traces were found in the complainant’s urine, could be obtained from a pharmacist only upon prescription; the evidence that the Appellant had in his possession, and was accustomed to use, flunitrazepam; and the Appellant’s own evidence that, at a time when, so other evidence would seem to suggest, the complainant was in a comatose state, some form of sexual activity took place. 
     23 His evidence if accepted by the jury – as it seems to have been – would, in my view, justify the jury in finding that, even though they were not satisfied to the required standard, that the Appellant in fact put his intention into the effect, he was guilty of the offence charged in the first count. 
     24 As I am not able to see any logical inconsistency between the jury verdicts on the first and third counts (R. v. Markulevski [2001] NSWCCA 290), I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     25 So far as the second ground of appeal is concerned, it seems to me that there are two answers to it. 
     26 The first is that, although it is true that there was no formal order made by the learned trial judge that the jury be at liberty to separate prior to returning a verdict, it is abundantly clear from the passage in the transcript record which I have set out above, that the jury sought the authority of the judge to leave and that the judge, having formed the view that it was proper that they be at liberty to do so, and having given the conventional warning about not discussing the matter with anybody during the course of the adjournment, then formally authorised them to leave and directed them to return on the following morning (see R. v. Radju [2001] NSWCCA 103; R. v. Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29). 
     27 But even if that is not, in substance, such an order as is required by s.54(b) of the Jury Act, it seems to me that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice and, therefore, this Court is not called upon to intervene. 
     28 I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     29 SULLY J: I entirely agree. 
     30 BELL J: I also agree. 
     31 POWELL JA: That is the order of the court.

     IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL60764/00Tuesday, 25 September 2001Regina v Guy GARDNERThe appellant was convicted of robbery. Part of the Crown evidence at the trial consisted of photographs taken by a bank security camera at the time of the robbery. The appellant objected to three aspects of the proceedings. First, the Crown called three police officers to give evidence that they were previously acquainted with the appellant, and that they had separately nominated the appellant as one of the persons in these photographs. The appellant objected to the police officers' evidence, but, following a voir dire, the trial Judge admitted the evidence. Second, in the course of summing up to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor made a comment on the failure of the appellant's mother to give evidence which contravened s20(3) of the Evidence Act 1995. Third, at the invitation of his counsel, for the benefit of the jury, the appellant displayed the same profile as appeared in the photographs.Held: per Sheller JA, Sully J and Hulme J agreeing:1. Following the decision in Smith v The Queen (2001) HCA 50, the evidence of the police officers as to their recognition of the person in the photographs as the appellant did not pass the relevance test in s55 of the Evidence Act. The police officers were in no better a position to make a comparison between the appellant and the person in the photographs than the jurors. 2. The error on the part of the Crown Prosecutor was adequately dealt with by the trial Judge in his summing up to the jury.3. The procedure of examining the appellant from a similar angle to that shown in the photographs had an obvious probative value, which outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice. R v Kirby [2000] NSWCCA 330, considered.ORDERS1. Appeal allowed;2. Quash the verdict;3. Order a new trial.

      Judgment 
       
     1 SHELLER JA: On 29 May 2000 the appellant, Guy Gardner, was indicted before his Honour Judge Armitage QC on four counts of robbery alleged to have taken place at the Westpac Bank at Baulkham Hills on 14 July 1999. The appellant pleaded not guilty. Part of the Crown evidence at his trial consisted of eight photographs taken by a bank security camera at the scene of the robberies. The Crown called three police officers who said they were previously acquainted with the appellant and who separately nominated the appellant as one of the persons in the photographs. The appellant's counsel objected to this evidence. A hearing on the voir dire took place. The trial Judge admitted the evidence of the three police officers and gave reasons for doing so. His Honour referred to this Court's decision in R v Smith (1999) 47 NSWLR 419. The Court held in that case that evidence given by police officers who had viewed still photographs taken by a bank security camera and identified an accused from the photographs as a person known to them was not ""evidence of an opinion"" but was direct evidence that the person shown in the photographs was the accused; as such it was not excluded by s76 of the Evidence Act 1995. 2 The appellant gave evidence of an alibi and denied any part in the robberies. On the invitation of his counsel he came out of the witness box and stood in front of the jury. He stood back to back with an instructing clerk and turned so that the jury could see his right profile. He said that since he was young he had a tattoo under his left eye. On 2 June 2000 the jury returned with a verdict of guilty on all counts. The appellant appeals against his conviction. 3 On 21 June 2001 the High Court made orders setting aside the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Smith and in place directing that there be a new trial of the appellant. The reasons for judgment were handed down on 16 August 2001; Smith v The Queen (2001) HCA 50. The majority judgment was that of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ. Their Honours held that in that case the evidence of the police was irrelevant and should not have been received. No question of admissibility had to be considered. In reliance in part on that decision the appellant filed amended grounds of appeal against his conviction arguing that the High Court decision meant that the evidence of the police officers was irrelevant and should not have been received. 4 When the appeal was called on the Crown advanced reasons designed to distinguish the present case from Smith. In order to understand the argument it is necessary to examine in some detail both the majority decision to which I have referred and the reasons for judgment of Kirby J. Kirby J held, contrary to the majority, that the police evidence in that case was relevant but agreed in the order of the Court on the basis that the evidence fell within the opinion rule and no exception to the opinion rule had been established. In para 6 the majority of the Court acknowledged that no attention was given to the question of the relevance of the evidence of the police officers in the arguments advanced at trial or on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Their Honours said that the question must always be asked and answered and that no discretion fell to be exercised. Irrelevant evidence may not be received. It can be said immediately therefore that the fact, if it be the fact, that the evidence of the police officers in the present case was not objected to as irrelevant is of no moment in deciding how this appeal should be disposed of. 5 After referring to Pt 3.1 of the Evidence Act and s55 in particular and posing the question of whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding their Honours said:  
      
       
        
         
          
         ""8 The issues which arose on the appellant's trial were very narrow. There being no dispute that there had been a robbery, the only disputed fact was whether the appellant is depicted in the bank photographs. It is important to notice that the question is framed in the present, not the past, tense. Having regard to the fact that the photographs which were tendered in evidence at trial depicted the occurrence of the robbery with which the appellant was charged, the question for the jury was whether they were satisfied, to the requisite standard, that the person then standing trial before them is shown in those photographs. 
          
          
         9 The only evidence led against the appellant in relation to that disputed fact was the evidence of the two police officers and the evidence that demonstrated that the photographs which were tendered in evidence had been taken by the bank's security cameras during the robbery. Neither police officer suggested that he had any basis for concluding that it is the appellant depicted in the bank photographs other than the knowledge that he had gained of the appellant's physical appearance during those earlier encounters and whatever was revealed to a person who looked at the photographs that were produced in evidence. There was no suggestion that the physical appearance of the appellant had changed materially between the time when the photographs were taken and the time of the trial, or that the police, by 
           
         reason of their previous observations of the appellant, were at some advantage in recognising the person in the photographs. It was acknowledged by counsel, in the course of argument in this court, that, by the time the evidence had concluded, the jurors had probably spent more time in the presence of the appellant than had the police witnesses before they gave their evidence. The police witnesses were in no better position to make a comparison between the appellant and the person in the photographs than the jurors or, for that matter, some member of the public who had been sitting in court 
           
         observing the proceedings. If such a member of the public had been called as a witness, the same question of relevance would have arisen. Thus, not only was the issue that was raised a very narrow issue, the data available to the jury for its resolution was no different in any significant way from the data upon which the police officers based their asserted conclusion. The police officers' conclusions and the jury's conclusion both depended upon combining their observation of the appellant's appearance with their observation of the photographs. (Having regard to the quality of the photographs we saw, it is not clear that the jury could not have compared them with the accused.) 
          
          
         10 The question of the relevance of the evidence of the police officers may be approached in this way. The fact in issue was, as we have earlier said, 'Is the person standing trial the person who is depicted at the right-hand side of some of the photographs tendered in evidence?' Is an assertion, in evidence, by a witness that he now recognises, or has previously recognised, the person who is depicted in those photographs as the accused, relevant evidence? That is, in the language of s55 of the Evidence Act, could that evidence, if accepted, rationally affect the assessment by the jury of the probability that it is the person standing trial who is depicted in the photographs? 
          
          
         11 Because the witness's assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation, the witness's assertion that he recognised the appellant is not evidence that could rationally affect the assessment by the jury of the question we have identified. The fact that someone else has reached a conclusion about the identity of the accused and the person in the picture does not provide any logical basis for affecting the jury's assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact when the conclusion is based only on material that is not different in any substantial way from what is available to the jury. The process of 
           
         reasoning from one fact (the depiction of a man in the security photographs) taken with another fact (the observed appearance of the accused) to the conclusion (that one is the depiction of the other) is neither assisted, nor hindered, by knowing that some other person has, or has not, arrived at that conclusion. Indeed, if the assessment of probability is affected by that knowledge, it is not by any process of reasoning, but by the decision-maker permitting substitution of the view of another, for the decision-maker's own conclusion. 
          
          
         12 In this case the evidence of the police was irrelevant and should not have been received. No question of admissibility had to be considered. 
          
          
         13 This is not to say that it will never be relevant for a witness to give evidence that the witness recognises who is depicted in a photograph. The obvious case in which that will be relevant is where the witness deposes to having identified someone from a photograph, or collection of photographs, shown to the witness and the identity of the person depicted is proved in some other way:  
         Alexander v The Queen 
          (1981) 145 CLR 395. Difficulties may arise, however, when the photograph which is used for identification and is tendered in evidence is, as was 
           
         the case here, a photograph taken of an incident which is the subject-matter of the proceeding. Even in such a case, a witness's evidence of recognition of the person depicted may be relevant. 
          
          
         14 Sometimes the facts in issue will extend beyond the narrow question whether the accused is the person depicted in the photograph. In  
         R v 
           
         Goodall  
         [1982] VR 33, the question included whether the accused owned a jacket of the kind that the offender depicted in security photographs of a robbery was shown to be wearing. A jacket, which was tendered in evidence, had been found with other incriminating items. Two police officers gave evidence that they had seen the accused wearing this kind of jacket before the robbery. They gave 
           
         further evidence that the man who was depicted in the security photograph was the accused, and that he was wearing a jacket of the kind they had seen him wearing before the robbery. The evidence was, therefore, relevant to link the accused to the jacket. It went beyond the bare assertion of recognition of the person on trial as the person shown in the photograph. 
          
          
         15 In other cases, the evidence of identification will be relevant because it goes to an issue about the presence or absence of some identifying feature other than one apparent from observing the accused on trial and the photograph which is said to depict the accused. Thus, if it is suggested that the appearance of the accused, at trial, differs in some significant way from the accused's appearance at the time of the offence, evidence from someone who knew how the accused looked at the time of the offence, that the picture depicted the accused as he or she appeared at that time, would not be irrelevant:  
         R v Palmer  
         [1981] 1 NSWLR 209. Or if it is suggested that there is some distinctive feature revealed by the photographs (as, for example, a manner of walking) which would not be apparent to the jury in court, 
           
         evidence both of that fact and the witness's conclusion of identity would not be irrelevant cf 
          Morrison v The Queen  
         unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, 30 November 1995. Similarly, if, as was the case in  
         R v Tipene 
          unreported, Court of Appeal of New Zealand, 30 May 2001, there is an issue whether photographs of different incidents depict the same person, evidence given about the identity of the person depicted may not be irrelevant. 
          
          
         16 Of course in any such case, further questions of admissibility would then arise. Those questions would very likely include questions about the application of the opinion rule (s76) and the questions presented by the general discretion to exclude evidence under s135, and the direction, in s137, to exclude prejudicial evidence. It is, however, not necessary to consider those questions in this matter. Answers to them may depend, in part, upon the precise nature and form of the evidence."" 
         
        
       
     6 From the passage quoted it should be noted that having regard to the quality of the photographs their Honours saw, it was not clear that the jury could not have compared them with the accused. In para 11 their Honours said that the witness's assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation. In para 14 their Honours gave the example of the admissibility of the evidence of police officers that the man who was depicted in the security photograph was the accused and that he was wearing a jacket of the kind they had seen him wearing before the robbery. That evidence was, their Honours said, relevant to link the accused to the jacket and went beyond bare assertion of recognition of the person on trial as the person shown in the photograph. In para 15 their Honours said that if it is suggested that the appearance of the accused, at trial, differs in some significant way from the accused's appearance at the time of the offence, evidence from someone who knew how the accused looked at the time of the offence, that the picture depicted the accused as he or she appeared at that time, would not be irrelevant. Essential to relevance and hence admissibility were questions whether the police witnesses by reason of their previous observations of the appellant were at an advantage in recognising the person in the photographs or were in a better position to make a comparison between the appellant and the person in the photographs than the jurors. See R v Griffith (1995) 79 A CrimR 125 at 127-8. See also R v Cook (1998) 130 NTR 28, particularly at 30-33. 7 The majority in the High Court referred uncritically to the decision of this Court in R v Palmer. In that case, two of the charges laid against the appellant related to bank robberies, one at East Hills on 25 September 1978 and the other at Oatley on 17 November 1978. Street CJ, in whose judgment Glass JA and Lusher J agreed, said at 210:  
      
       
        
         
         ""On each of the armed robberies the offenders were photographed by security cameras within the bank's premises. In relation to the first one at East Hills, three photographs of a man in a tracksuit with a stocking over his head, taken by the security camera, were tendered and admitted without objection. The Crown called evidence from a Mrs Delaney, who was the wife of a second man who was involved in this particular armed robbery and in the course of her evidence she was shown these photographs."" 
         
        
       
     8 On the occasion of a second armed robbery there were three photographs taken by the bank's security camera. They were admitted into evidence without objection. It appears that the man photographed had something over his head; see 212A. One of the photographs had been enlarged and a poster had been prepared for display at banks inviting any person who recognised the man photographed to inform the bank manager or the local police. Street CJ said at 211:  
      
       
        
         
         ""A Mrs Furlong saw this poster and then in due course she and her husband communicated with the manager of the bank where they saw it. The evidence from them, which was proceeded by evidence of a comparatively formal nature from the bank manager himself, was as follows: Mrs Furlong, who gave her address as Sulman Road, Cabramatta, was shown the poster in the witness box and identified it as the poster she had seen at the bank before she spoke to the bank manager."" 
         
        
       
     9 She was asked whether she recognised the man appearing in the exhibit. She said yes. She was asked where she had seen him previously and said ""Across the road from us at No 8 Sulman Road, Cabramatta."" Asked when she first saw him she said approximately the end of October or November, the first week in November 1978. She saw him at or near the premises until about the middle of January. She next saw him on about 22 February (1979) when he had grown a beard and his hair was collar length. 10 Mr Furlong gave similar evidence that in October 1978 he was clean-shaven, hair was very presentable. In February he noticed for the first time that he had a moustache and beard. A Mrs Johnston who lived in the same house as the appellant said that when she was living with him he did not have a moustache or a beard. After he came back in March he had had a tattoo put on his face. His hair was longer and he had a moustache and beard. Mrs Johnston was shown three photographs taken by the security camera in the Oatley bank and the poster. She had noticed the photograph in the bank after the appellant had left her place in January. She said the poster was the appellant and recognised one of the men in the photographs as the appellant. Mrs Johnston had had an intimate relationship with the appellant. 11 Street CJ said, at 213-4:  
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr Donovan has challenged the admission into evidence of what was said by the witnesses in the passages that have been quoted. He contends that it was opinion evidence and that it was inadmissible on the basis that the witnesses were not competent to express an opinion regarding the identity of a man with a stocking over his face with a man that they knew. He contends also that it was hearsay in that it involved an account of recognition on an earlier occasion, something which had taken place outside the court rather than in the course of the trial. Finally he contends that the witnesses were being asked to state an opinion upon an ultimate question which it was the function of the jury to determine. 
          
         As I have earlier said, I entertain no doubt as to the admissibility of this evidence. Two persons such as the Furlongs who saw the photograph at the bank were, in my view, fully competent to give evidence at the trial identifying the man in that photograph as the man who used to live opposite to them. It is to be observed that Mrs Furlong gave her evidence in the past tense in that she said she recognized the man in the photograph as the man who lived opposite to her, meaning that she made this recognition at the time she saw the photograph at the bank. Mr Furlong carried his evidence expressly through to the present tense of the trial in his recognition of the man in the photograph as the man who used to live opposite to him and his wife. There was, however, no 
           
         significance attaching to the past tense used by Mrs Furlong in the contest that arose at the trial regarding admissibility. The point which was argued was whether it was open to a witness such as Mr Furlong or Mrs Furlong to give evidence that a man shown in a security photograph was a particular individual known to them. 
          
         In my view such evidence is clearly admissible. It is quite apparent from a reading of Mrs Furlong's evidence that, although expressed in the past tense, she was confirming a continuing and current state of mind regarding the identity of the man in the photograph with the man who used to live opposite to her. Indeed, the absence of significance on this point of tense could not be made clearer than by the bringing forward of the matter into the present tense in the cross-examination of Mr Furlong. The matter being contested was essentially whether it was proper for a witness to say that a person shown in a photograph was a particular person known to them. I can see no basis for doubting the admissibility of evidence along these lines. 
          
         So far as concerns the evidence from Mrs Delaney, the position is even stronger. Mrs Delaney was able to say, and did in fact say, that the photographs shown to her of some of the scenes at the robbery at East Hills showed the appellant. Again I can see no justifiable basis, either in principle or on authority, for precluding this evidence from being placed before the court. Mrs Johnson likewise in relation to the Oatley robbery said the same thing, namely, that the man photographed in the security photographs was the present appellant. 
          
         The argument which Mr Donovan has presented persuasively to the effect that the witnesses were deposing by way of an opinion to an ultimate question which it was for the jury to determine does not, in my view, have any substance. This was a clear matter of evidence in respect of which each of the four witnesses from whom extracts have been quoted was competent to give admissible evidence along the lines of the questions asked of them."" 
         
        
       
     12 From Kirby J's reasons for judgment can be gleaned some idea of the quality of the photographs admitted in evidence in Smith v The Queen. The face of the person alleged to be the appellant was shaded by a hood. The photographs were black and white. Kirby J said that in most of the photographs the features of the person alleged to be the appellant were partially hidden by a hood pulled over the head. His Honour observed:  
      
       
        
         
         ""42 ..... It is not unusual for those who participate in crimes of this character to attempt to disguise their features. A jury, invited to identify the participants as the accused from photographs with such impediments, might, quite properly, hesitate to do so solely on the basis of their own observations of the photographs as compared to the appearance of the accused before them. The jury's hesitation in this case is demonstrated by their request for a magnifying glass and the two questions they put to the trial judge. Members of a jury watch a person such as the appellant (especially where, as here, that person gives no evidence) sitting immobile in the courtroom. The police witnesses had repeatedly viewed the appellant in daylight. They had 
           
         seen him in motion. They had observed him from different angles. They had had the opportunity to view him engaged in varying and more natural facial movements."" 
         
        
       
     13 These descriptions of the photographs and the decision of the majority lead to the conclusion that the fact that the appellant when photographed was wearing some sort of hood and matters such as those referred to by Kirby J are not significant when determining whether or not the police witnesses were in any better position to make a comparison between the appellant and the person in the photographs than the jurors or, for that matter, some member of the public who had been sitting in court observing the proceedings. 14 In the present case the first photograph, exhibit B, shows a person alleged to be the appellant dressed in a tracksuit with a scarf or high collar. The face is seen from right profile, the right eye closed and the mouth open and slightly out of focus. The person is wearing a dark baseball cap which hides the forehead and back of the head. The second photograph shows a person similarly dressed leaning more forward, again from the right profile with the right eye closed and the mouth open wearing a baseball cap with the same effect and again slightly out of focus. The next photograph shows a person from the rear. It is out of focus, the neck and the right ear is visible, some hair and the back of a cap. The next photograph shows part of the torso of a person from the front, the footwear is visible as is the person's left hand by the side. No part of the face is visible. The next photograph is of someone who clearly is not the same person as the first two photographs to which I referred. The same can be said of the next photograph. The next photograph is a larger photograph showing the persons in the earlier photographs, the left one being the same person as in the first two photographs, bending down away from the camera. One can see some part of the right profile of the face under the baseball cap but not the eye or mouth. The next large photograph shows that person again from a right profile. The profile of the face is out of focus. It is hard to see whether the eye is open or closed, the mouth appears to be slightly open. 15 The presence of the baseball cap and the quality of the photographs, particularly the want of proper focus, meant that the photographs might have been within the category Kirby J described as carrying such impediments that a jury, invited to identify the participant as the accused from them, might quite properly hesitate to do so solely on the basis of their own observations of the photographs as compared to the appearance of the accused before them. However, this rises no higher than the comment of the majority in Smith v The Queen, namely that having regard to the quality of the photographs it is not clear that the jury could not have compared them with the accused. This being so, the Crown's attempt to distinguish Smith v The Queen by suggesting that the appearance of the accused at trial differed in some significant way from his appearance at the time of the offence when he was wearing a cap, must fail. That the photographs were slightly out of focus is not a point of distinction. 16 A particular problem in this case is that because the evidence of the police witnesses was not objected to on grounds of relevance, the trial Judge gave no consideration to such questions as whether the police witnesses at the time their evidence was tendered were in a better position to make a comparison between the appellant and the person in the photographs than the jurors or for any other reason were at some advantage in recognising the person in the photographs by reason of his dress. Without the assistance of the trial Judge's views on these matters it seems to me that this Court can do no more than conclude that in relying on the decision of this Court in Smith his Honour failed, understandably since no objection was taken, to consider the relevance of the evidence of the police witnesses.  
      
       
        
       Grounds of appeal 
        
         
         ""1. His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of identification of the appellant as being one of the persons in the security camera photographs by Police Officers Shaun Dempsey, Stephen Dempsey and Patrick Gerard Sharkey. 
          
         2. His Honour erred in failing to exclude the evidence pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act. 
          
          
         3. His Honour erred in not discharging the jury after the Crown made comment in contravention of s20(3) of the Evidence Act. 
          
          
         4. His Honour erred in directing the jury as to the failure of the appellant to provide a profile view to the jury and to put on the jacket and cap."" 
         
        
        
       Ground 1 
       
     17 This ground must succeed. The trial Judge should have determined whether the evidence of the police witnesses was irrelevant and inadmissible. It follows from this that there must be a new trial.  
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
       
     18 This question does not arise.  
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
       
     19 In the course of summing up to the jury the Crown Prosecutor commented on the failure by the accused to call various witnesses and specifically referred to the mother of the accused. She said that those witnesses had not been called to corroborate his alibi. In so doing the Crown Prosecutor contravened the exception to s20(3) of the Evidence Act which provides that the judge or any party:  
      
       
        
         
         ""(other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure to give evidence by a person who, at the time of the failure, was: 
          
         ..... 
          
         (b) a parent .....of the defendant."" 
         
        
       
     20 The trial Judge pointed out to the jury that the Crown Prosecutor was not entitled to refer to the fact that the accused's mother had not been called as a witness because of the provision in the Evidence Act. His Honour went on:  
      
       
        
         
         ""However, I, as the presiding judge am entitled to refer to that matter and what I say to you about it is this, there may be many reasons why the mother was not called. An obvious one is that she may have no recollection of the events of the morning in question. Nevertheless, you should not speculate as to why she was not called."" 
         
        
       
     21 In my opinion, the Crown Prosecutor's comment summarised in the written submissions as being words to the effect, referring to the mother, ""you might think she'd come along"", were adequately dealt with by the trial Judge and did not call for the discharge of the jury.  
      
       
        
       Ground 4 
       
     22 When the appellant was arrested certain clothing was seized from his premises. This clothing was an exhibit at the trial. In the course of his summing up the trial Judge said:  
      
       
        
         
         ""Mr Jauncey dealt with the estimate of height given by one of the detectives. That is, I think the estimate was about six feet. Clearly Mr Jauncey says his client is nowhere near six feet tall. Mr Jauncey then pointed out that his client voluntarily took part in the record of interview. He was not obliged to do that but he elected to do it. Mr Jauncey put to you that has never been suggested by the defence that the police were out to get Guy Gardner. What the defence says is that there is a pre-disposition. He puts to you that the police are the same as anyone else. They are professional witnesses and they are eager to please. Mr Jauncey put to you that his client had not tried to hide and has displayed himself in this court room from many angles. Well, members of the jury, it is not as I say for me to buy into the facts at all. The only reason I 
           
         intend saying something more to you about that is because, of course, it was the Crown Prosecutor who addressed first. She had no opportunity of responding to that submission. Obviously someone has to address first and no one of course is complaining about the rules as they exist. It is perfectly proper that the Crown Prosecutor should address first. That is what she did but she cannot respond to that. It would seem to me that no doubt the Crown would put to you that there is, of course, nowhere to hide in this court room but if the accused really wanted you to have a good look at him from the side that matters, that is the right profile, that is the side shown in the photograph exhibit B, there was nothing at all to 
           
         stop him from moving onto the floor of the court, directly in front of the jury box, nothing to stop him if he wanted to putting on the trousers and the jacket that are in evidence, putting on a cap and standing in the very same position relative to you as the person in exhibit B is standing relative to the camera. Nothing to stop him doing that but of course he has not. I would imagine that the Crown would have put something along those lines to you."" 
         
        
       
     23 In R v Kirby [2000] NSWCCA 330 Wood CJ at CL, who gave reasons for judgment with which Beazley JA and O'Keefe J agreed, referred to the fact that in the course of cross-examination the appellant was asked to place on his head an Akubra hat, that had been found as his house, being a hat that he agreed was similar to the hat seen in one of those stills. After he had put it on he was asked to put it back on to turn his head sideways and to pull the brim down a bit. This, of course, all took place as he was giving evidence. The Chief Judge said at para 46:  
      
       
        
         
         ""46 In the present case the jury were not being asked to make an identification reliant upon their own memories. They were doing no more than they inevitably would have done once the security photographs were tendered - ie, to examine them against the man in the dock, and against the various items of clothing and otherwise that had been found at his home and tendered in evidence. The difference is that they were making a comparison of evidence, not an identification from their own memories. 
          
          
         47 The demonstration by a witness of his or her personal appearance, or of the sound of his or her voice, or the provision of a sample of handwriting, and the wearing of a piece of clothing connected with a crime to see if it fits, are commonplace events and entirely unexceptional. They do not require any independent proof 
           
         ( 
         Bulejcik  
         (1995) 
           
         185 CLR 375 at 380-381) and their purpose is to enable a jury or other trier of fact to make their own comparison with other physical evidence before the Court:  
         Sorby 
          (1983) 153 CLR 281 at 292. The permissibility of such a procedure was expressly recognised by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in  
         Bulejcik 
          at 395, where their Honours said: 
          
           
            
             
              
               
               'Where two voices are being heard side by side, as occurred in the present case, the concern is not with familiarity or distinctiveness but with whether the quality and quantity of the material is sufficient to enable a useful comparison to be made. By way of analogy, asking a jury to compare a photograph of an accused with a security camera picture of the perpetrator of a robbery involves quite different considerations from asking a witness whether the accused is the person they remember seeing at the robbery.' 
               
              
             
            
           
          
          
         48 So much was conceded by counsel, whose submission rested, essentially, upon the proposition that the risk of unfair prejudice to the 
           
         appellant, of a procedure requiring him to wear a hat while the jury had the security stills, outweighed the probative value attaching to it, thereby attracting its exclusion under s137  
         Evidence Act 
         . This was said to arise because the exercise risked reminding the jury that the man wearing the hat in the dock was the offender, or subliminally reinforcing that contention. 
          
          
         49 For the reasons mentioned, and bearing in mind that it was both inevitable and necessary for the jury to pay close attention to the security videos, to the stills taken from them, to the photograph of the appellant taken within days of the offence, and to the descriptions given 
           
         of the second offender by the State Rail staff and by the arresting officer, I am not persuaded that the procedure was unfair. It made sense, if a comparison was to be made, for the appellant to wear an Akubra hat of the kind worn by the offender, since that was how that person appeared in the stills and videos. 
          
          
         50 The comparison evidence, and the procedure had an obvious probative value, and the case was not one in which there was, to my mind, any risk of the jury giving the exercise an unwarranted weight, or of 
           
         misusing it, or of being led into a process of evaluation or reasoning that was unjustified, and hence of a kind that would attract s137 of the  
         Evidence Act; Lockyer ( 
         1996) 89 A CrimR 457 and 
          Singh-Bal  
         (1997) 92 
           
         A 
           
         CrimR 397; and see also  
         Blick.  
         In particular, it is impossible to accept the proposition that the jury ever lost sight of the fact that it was the Crown contention that the appellant was the second offender, or that the comparison exercise reminded them of that, or reinforced it in their minds."" 
         
        
       
     24 In my opinion, there was no impropriety in the trial Judge's directions to the jury of which complaint is made. This ground of appeal fails.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
     25 In my opinion, the following orders should be made:  
      
       
        
       1. Appeal allowed; 
        
        
       2. Quash the verdict; 
        
        
       3. Order a new trial. 
       
     26 SULLY J: I agree with Sheller JA. 27 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Sheller JA. I agree also with his Honour's reasons except those relating to the fourth ground. Given my other conclusions, I do not find it necessary to consider this ground.

      REGINA v. LLOYD JACKSON 
       
       
      Judgment 
       
       
     1 POWELL JA; This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to the provisions of s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912  against a judgment delivered, and an order made, by Puckeridge D.C.J. on 24 August 2001. 
     2 The application which led his Honour to deliver that judgment, and to make that order, was an application made by Notice of Motion filed on behalf of the accused Jackson, seeking an order that an indictment which was then either prepared or in draft form be severed and that trials proceed separately in respect of counts alleging offences against each of five named persons. 
     3 In the event, on the application before Puckeridge DCJ, the Crown did not press for a joint hearing of all counts or proposed counts in respect of those five named persons, but indicated that it wished to proceed with a joint indictment relating to the offences affecting three only of those persons who might be identified as B, H and E. 
     4 It has been said (R v. Verma  (1987) 30 A Crim R 441, 443) that “the most straightforward case in which separate trials will not be ordered is where the evidence admissible on the trial of one charge is in any event admissible on the trial of the other, by way (for example) of similar facts.” 
     5 The basis upon which Puckeridge DCJ ordered that there be separate trials is set out in his judgment as follows: 
      
      
       
       ""I have considered the submissions of the Crown and also considered the statements of the three complainants which were handed up. I consider that the prejudice to the accused if the trial was to proceed on the basis of one indictment for all three complaints (sic) would be very high. Accepting that the evidence from all three complainants alleged acts which have striking similarity, and that such evidence would have significant probative value. I consider that if a trial was to proceed on the basis of the one indictment as proposed, the accused would be denied the opportunity of a fair trial.  
        
        
       The Crown seeks to rely on the similar acts of the three complainants to show a tendency to behave in circumstances of each particular charge and show the improbability of the offence occurring coincidentally.  
        
        
       It has been indicated to the Court the accused denies each and every charge. It may be that evidence adduced on behalf of one complainant might be considered by the Court not properly admissible on a charge by another complainant, despite any question of relevance. 
        
        
       It is a possibility which arises and I consider that the prejudice to the accused is such and the denial of the opportunity of a fair trial is such that it is inappropriate that the trial, as listed to commence on 27 August, should not proceed on the one indictment."" 
       
     6 The written submissions which have been prepared on behalf of the Crown contain a table setting out, by reference to the statements which were tendered to Puckeridge DCJ on the hearing of the application, those activities on the part of the accused which as his Honour found, demonstrated a striking similarity. 
     7 That similarity being demonstrated, Puckeridge DCJ, having first considered the provisions of ss 97 and 98 of The Evidence Act 1995 (”the Act) was required to determine whether, by reason of the operation of the provisions of s 101 of the Act, that evidence ought, or ought not, to be admitted at a trial, whether a trial in relation to the offences against one complainant, or in relation to the offences against all three complainants. 
     8 Section 101 (2) of the Act provides: 
      
      
       
       ""Tendency evidence against a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant that is adduced by the prosecution, cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant."" 
       
     9 It is clear from the passage from Puckeridge DCJ’s judgment, which I have set out earlier in these reasons, that his Honour did not proceed to carry out the exercise required of him by sub-s 2 of s 101 of the Act. This being so, it appears to me that his Honour erred in the conclusion to which he came and that the Crown has made out a case to have his Honour's order set aside on the ground that the discretion vested in him miscarried. 
     10 As a result of discussion which has taken place during the course of submissions, it seems clear that the accused would not oppose the order made by his Honour being set aside and the matter being remitted to his Honour to be dealt with according to law, so long as it is accepted, as I do accept, that, in that event, it would be open to the accused to make a fresh application seeking to obtain an order for a separate trial, or separate trials, in relation to any charges that may be the subject of the indictment, which is ultimately preferred against him. 
     11 I would, therefore, propose that the appeal be allowed, that the order made by Puckeride DCJ set aside and that the matter be remitted to the District Court to be determined in accordance with law. 
     12 SULLY J; I agree. 
     13 BELL J; I also agree. 
     14 POWELL JA; Those are the orders of the Court.

       REGINA v Terrence James FULLER 
        
        
       Judgment 
       
     1 HEYDON JA:  
      
       
      Background 
       
       
      The appellant was tried before Garling DCJ and a jury on 9-13 October 2000. Thirteen counts went to the jury. Counts 1-6 were allegations of six acts of sexual intercourse between the appellant and the complainant without consent at times when she was aged between 12 and 15. Counts 1A-6A were respectively alternatives to Counts 1-6 alleging, not sexual intercourse without consent, but carnal knowledge of a person under the age of 16 years contrary to various sections of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (NSW). Count 8 was an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years. On 13 October 2000 the jury returned its verdicts. The accused was acquitted of all counts except Count 6A. On that count he was convicted, and he now appeals against his conviction on two grounds.  
       
       
      Ground 1: inconsistent verdict 
       
     2 Ground 1 was: 
      
       
       “The verdict in count 6A is inconsistent and unreasonable.” 
       
     3 The inconsistency relied on was a supposed inconsistency between the acquittal on Count 6 and the conviction on Count 6A. Count 6 was: 
      
       
       “In the months of June or July 1986 at Kempsey in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have sexual intercourse with Julie Ann DONNELLY without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting thereto, she then being 14 or 15 years old.” 
       
       
      Count 6A was: 
       
       
       “In the months of June or July 1986 at Kempsey in the State of New South Wales [the appellant] did have sexual intercourse with Julie Ann DONNELLY she then being 14 or 15 years old.” 
       
     4 The appellant was the de facto husband of Lynette Joy Donnelly, who was the sister of the complainant’s mother Karen May Murray. The complainant regarded the appellant as her uncle.  
     5 On Counts 6 and 6A, the complainant’s evidence in chief was that on occasion she stayed overnight at her aunt’s house.  
      
       
       “Q. Where would you sleep when you stayed overnight? 
        
       A. Sometimes in the loungeroom on the floor on a mattress and other times in my cousin’s bedroom. 
        
       Q. Can you remember any specific occasion, sleeping on the mattress in the loungeroom? 
        
       A. I do remember an occasion, yeah. 
        
       Q. Is this an occasion that something occurred or not? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Between you and the accused?

       Q. Are you able to say how old you were? 
        
       A. I think I was 15 at the time, 14. 
        
       Q. You’d gone to sleep on the mattress at some time? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. Do you know what time you went to sleep or you went to the mattress at least? 
        
       A. Around 10. 
        
       Q. What were you doing before you went to sleep? 
        
       A. We were watching videos. 
        
       Q. Who’s ‘we’? 
        
       A. My aunty Lynette, Terry and Ian Dufty. 
        
       Q. Who is Ian Dufty? 
        
       A. He was a friend of the accused and my aunty. 
        
       Q. Was he older or younger than you? 
        
       A. Older than me. 
        
       Q. How much older? 
        
       A. Five or six years I think. 
        
       Q. What, was he a regular visitor to the house or not? 
        
       A. He was. 
        
       Q. So you were watching videos? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. In the loungeroom? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. You’ve gone to the mattress to go to sleep I presume? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. Who was in the loungeroom then? 
        
       A. I think my aunty had gone to bed and Terry used to sit up in the kitchen a lot, drinking coffee and reading books and stuff, I was alone I think in the loungeroom when I went to bed. 
        
       Q. What about Ian Dufty, do you know if he was still there? 
        
       A. I can’t recall if he was still there, I think he may have been. 
        
       Q. So you went to sleep? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. And you were awoken? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. When you woke up, what did you see? 
        
       A. Terry fuller on top of me. 
        
       Q. Was there a light on or not? 
        
       A. No there wasn’t a light on, but I knew it was him. 
        
       Q. Was there any light in the room at all? 
        
       A. No – oh actually yeah there was, the light from the TV. 
        
       Q. The TV was still on was it? 
        
       A. The TV was on but it was turned right down, it was just the light. 
        
       Q. How did you know it was Terry Fuller? 
        
       A.. I just knew it was him.

       Q. What were you wearing? 
        
       A. A nightie and knickers I think. 
        
       Q. Did you notice anything about your clothing when you woke up?

       A. Yeah. 
        
       Q. Nightie pulled up? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. And your knickers were pulled down? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. Do you know how that happened? 
        
       A. I think he done it, yeah before, before he got on top. 
        
       Q. You said he was on top of you, are you able to just tell the jury if you could, the position that he was in relation to you? 
        
       A. Yeah I was laying on my back and he was on top of me. 
        
       Q. Was he laying straight along the length of your body or -- 
        
       A. Straight on top, yep. 
        
       Q. What was the situation with your legs? 
        
       A. They were open, he’d opened my legs, forced my legs open. 
        
       Q. Did anything happen after you woke up and you saw what was happening? 
        
       A. Yeah, he proceeded to have sex with me. 
        
       Q. Can you say what he did please? 
        
       A. He put his penis in my vagina and was there for like 5 minutes. 
        
       Q. What was he doing, was he moving or was he still or -- 
        
       A. Yes, he was moving. 
        
       Q. Did you say anything after you woke up? 
        
       A. He had his hand on my mouth, I couldn’t talk. 
        
       Q. Did you try to or not? 
        
       A. Yeah I did, I knew my aunty was in the house at that time. 
        
       Q. What did you try to do? 
        
       A. I tried to make a noise but it didn’t work. 
        
       Q. You tried to what? 
        
       A. Tried to make a noise, but it never had any effect. 
        
       Q. You said this happened for how long? 
        
       A. 5 minutes. 
        
       Q. Did something happen then? 
        
       A. Yeah while he was still on top of me, I seen the light come on and heard the door open and my aunty was standing in the doorway and she just straight away attacked him, like ‘what are you doing.’ 
        
       Q. Can you say what happened? 
        
       A. She asked him what he was doing. 
        
       Q. In what sort of voice did she say that? 
        
       A. She was angry, she knew straight away what was going on, what had happened, she was calling him names, she smacked his face. 
        
       Q. Are you able to remember what she said? 
        
       A. She called him a ‘dirty bastard’ and asked him what he was doing. 
        
       Q. When you saw the light go on, where was he? 
        
       A. Still on top of me. 
        
       Q. Had he taken his penis out of your vagina at that time? 
        
       A. He jumped off really quickly once he realised my aunty was standing in the doorway and told her he was just talking to me. 
        
       Q. I’m sorry I missed that? 
        
       A. He told her he was just talking to me. 
        
       Q. He said that he did he? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. Did you aunt say anything after he said that? 
        
       A. She didn’t believe him, she -- 
        
       Q. Can you say what she said? 
        
       A. She just called him a ‘dirty bastard’ and asked him what he was doing and he wouldn’t give her a straight answer and she was just that angry, she got in the car and left, it was then that she went down to my mum’s place.” 
       
     6 Five or ten minutes later her stepfather arrived and took her home. The complainant was also asked: 
      
       
       “Q. When the light came on, did you see the accused? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. Where was he when the light came on? 
        
       A. On top of me. 
        
       Q. Which way was he facing? 
        
       A. My face.” 
       
       
      The complainant adhered to her evidence in cross-examination. 
       
     7 Mrs Donnelly’s evidence in chief about Counts 6 and 6A was as follows: 
      
       
       Q. That’s all right. Now Mrs Donnelly I’m going to ask you try and remember a particular night that Julie was at your house, staying overnight. Can you remember a particular occasion when something occurred? 
        
       A. Yes I do. 
        
       Q. Can you say, think of that time, when that was? 
        
       A. Yeah it was, it was in 86 and it was at, at the house. 
        
       Q. That’s at West Kempsey? 
        
       A.. Yes. 
        
       Q. Are you able to say what time in 86? 
        
       A. It was around June, July. 
        
       Q. Is there any reason you can nominate those months? 
        
       A. Yes, my son was about three months old. 
        
       Q. Which son was that? 
        
       A. Scott James Fuller. 
        
       Q. You said it was at the house? 
        
       (No verbal reply) 
        
       Q. Can you say what time of the day or night it was? 
        
       A. I recall going to bed around 12.30 that night. 
        
       Q. If I can just stop you there. When you went to bed who was in the house? 
        
       A. Julie and Terrence and Ian Dufty. 
        
       Q. Who’s Ian Dufty? 
        
       A. He was a friend of the family and he lived in the neighbourhood and we kind of met him when we moved in there and Terry’d done a bit of work to his, one of his cars that he was fixing up and we kind of met him through there. He was kind of like family. He used to come and sometimes he’d stay and he’d have lunch or tea with us. 
        
       Q. So you went to bed about 12.30? 
        
       (No verbal reply) 
        
       Q. Where was Ian Dufty in the house? 
        
       A. Ian was in the lounge room with Terrence and Julie. They were watching television. 
        
       Q. Was Julie still awake when you went to bed, do you know, or not? 
        
       A. Yeah, Julie was still awake when I went to bed. 
        
       Q. What about Mr Dufty? 
        
       A. Yeah, he was awake as well. 
        
       Q. What about the accused, Terry? 
        
       A. Yeah, Terry was there with them, yeah. 
        
       Q. What about the children, where were they? 
        
       A. They were in bed. 
        
       Q. What’s the next thing you remember happening that night? 
        
       A. I woke up around 4.30 and Terry wasn’t in the bed so I thought I’d go and have a look for him and I walked from the main bedroom through the hall to the lounge room and the lounge room door was closed and I opened it and the lounge room was in darkness so I turned the light on. 
        
       A. What did you see? 
        
       A. I saw Terrence lying on top of Julie, between her legs, with no clothes on. 
        
       Q. Who had no clothes on? 
        
       A. Terrence had no clothes on. He had, when he stood up his underpants were hanging at his ankles and Julie was uncovered and she had no clothes on. 
        
       Q. Did you say anything? 
        
       A I said, ‘what do you think you’re doing.’ He said ‘nuthin’ I’m only talking to her’ and he repeated his self and I told he was a bastard and I smacked his face. 
        
       Q. Where was Julie when you said and did that? 
        
       A. Still laying on the mattress. 
        
       Q. What was her state of dress at that time? 
        
       A. She was very upset. 
        
       Q. Did she have any clothes on at the time? 
        
       A. No. 
        
       Q Did you see Mr Dufty? 
        
       A. When I smacked Terrence’s face I saw Ian kind of sit up and – he must’ve heard the commotion. He kind of slightly moved up a bit because he was on a mattress over toward the wall, near the television. 
        
       Q. Did you see Julie do anything at that time? 
        
       A. She tried to pull the sheet up over herself to cover herself. 
        
       Q. Did you notice anything about her? 
        
       A. Only that she was upset. 
        
       Q. What did you notice about her to make you think that? 
        
       A. She was really upset in the face. 
        
       Q. How were you at that time? 
        
       A. Upset. 
        
       Q. What did you do then? 
        
       A. I went into the bedroom and got my car keys and I got in my car and I drove to my sister’s place at 45 Broughton Street and knocked on the door. 
        
       Q. Can I just stop you there – your sister, your mean Julie’s mum? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. You knocked on the door? 
        
       A. And her husband John answered the door and I went in and sat on my sister’s bed and I asked my sister could she remove her daughter from my house, that I just caught Terry laying on top of her in the lounge room on a mattress.  
        
       Q. Did you speak to John? 
        
       A.. I may’ve said that to John when he answered the door. 
        
       Q. Did John go somewhere? 
        
       A. John went up to get Julie from the house. 
        
       Q. John left. What did you do. Did you stay there? 
        
       A. I stayed there talking to my sister, yeah. 
        
       Q. Just pardon me one moment please ma’am. Did John eventually come back to the house? 
        
       A. John came back, not long after, and he had Julie with him.” 
       
     8 Mrs Donnelly was cross-examined as follows: 
      
       
       “Q. Ma’am you told us yesterday that you went around to your sister’s place leaving Julie and Terry Fuller in the house with your kids, remember telling us that? 
        
       A. Yes I do. 
        
       Q. And as a result of you going to your sister’s place you tell us that John went back round to your place and brought Julie back home? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. And you said, when you were being asked questions by the Crown Prosecutor, that you said to your sister Karen, that you’d found Terry Fuller on top of Julie? 
        
       A. In the loungeroom, yes. 
        
       Q. In the loungeroom. Now ma’am I suggest that you didn’t say that to your sister that night? 
        
       A. I beg your pardon, I did, 
        
       Q. And I suggest that it was on a later date that you spoke to or told your sister what you say you saw that night? 
        
       A. It wasn’t on a later date at all. 
        
       Q. And I suggest that you didn’t say you found Terry Fuller on top of Julie? 
        
       A. I did find Terry Fuller on top of Julie in my loungeroom. 
        
       Q. I suggest that you didn’t say that ma’am to your sister Karen? 
        
       A. I did say that to my sister. 
        
       Q. I suggest that you said to your sister Karen, ‘I went into the loungeroom and Terry was leaning over the top of Julie’? 
        
       A. Terry was on top of Julie in the loungeroom. 
        
       Q. Ma’am if you could listen to my questions. I suggest that you said to your sister Karen, these words. ‘I went into the loungeroom and Terry was leaning over the top of Julie’? 
        
       A. I did not, I did not tell my sister that. I told my sister that I had found Terrence laying on top of Julie in the loungeroom on a mattress. 
        
       Q. I see and you say that you told her that that night, is that right, or that day? 
        
       A. That morning, the early hours of that morning. 
        
       Q. Well ma’am you’re talking about a conversation that you say you had about 13 or 14 years ago, that’s right isn’t it? 
        
       A. Yes and I remember. 
        
       Q. You remember, word for word what you said? 
        
       A. Yes I do. 
        
       Q. Did you make a note of it somewhere? 
        
       A. No, it’s something that I’m not going to forget ever, what I saw. 
        
       Q. And what about what you told your sister? 
        
       A. I told my sister what I saw. 
        
       Q. Isn’t it true that all you saw ma’am that night was Terry in the loungeroom at the same time that Julie was in the loungeroom? 
        
       A. I saw Terrence on top of Julie in the loungeroom, okay, that’s what I saw, that’s what I saw.” 
       
     9 Mrs Murray’s evidence in chief was: 
      
       
        “Q. … Now Miss Murray I wonder if I could ask you to take your mind back to 1980s, do you recall a night, when you were living in Broughton Street, when your sister came to the house? 
        
       A. Yes, she came there a couple of times actually. 
        
       Q. Can you remember a – and if I can ask you to remember a particular night and this is an occasion – if I can just take your mind to it, when your husband left and got Julie? 
        
       A. Yes, I remember the night. 
        
       Q. Firstly, can you remember what time of the night it was that Lynette came? 
        
       A. Late, to the best of my knowledge it was late, because we were woken up. 
        
       Q. So you’d been to sleep? 
        
       A. We’d been in bed, yes. 
        
       Q. You were woken up? 
        
       A. Yep. 
        
       Q. And Julie was there? 
        
       A. No. 
        
       Q. I’m sorry, I withdraw that. Lynette was there? 
        
       A. Lynette came in. 
        
       Q. Did you notice anything about Lynette when she came in? 
        
       A. She was angry. 
        
       Q. Anything else? 
        
       A. Upset. 
        
       Q. What did you notice about her to make you think that? 
        
       A. She was crying. 
        
       Q. Now was there a conversation, or did Lynette say something, just ‘yes’ or ‘no’ at this stage? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q.. She did, who did she say it to? 
        
       A. To me. 
        
       Q. And where were you, can you remember it? 
        
       A. I was lying in bed and she was sitting alongside the bed. 
        
       Q. So she came into your bedroom? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
       Q. And was your husband at home that night? 
        
       A. We were both in bed at the time, he answered the door. 
        
       Q. Now can you remember what Lynette said to you? 
        
       A. Yes I can, she said, that ‘Could I please go and get Julie from her home as she had just found her husband,’ or at that time, ‘Terry laying on top of our daughter.’ John immediately got into the vehicle, I said to John, ‘Go and get her’, John left, about a five minute drive to the house where Julie was, he returned with her, she went straight to her room and slammed the door and went to bed. Lynette was still sitting there with me, I recall that she was still there when John came back.” 
       
       
      She was cross-examined to suggest that what Mrs Donnelly in fact said was: “Terry was leaning over the top of Julie”.  
       
     10 Mr John Murray confirmed the arrival of Mrs Donnelly and his own role in collecting the complainant, but he said he did not participate in the conversation between Mrs Donnelly and Mrs Murray, though he did hear the names of the appellant and the complainant being mentioned. 
     11 The appellant denied having sexual intercourse with the complainant, as he had in an interview with the police and as he has to this day.  
     12 Mr Dufty gave evidence on behalf of the appellant. He said that it was he who had had sexual intercourse with the complainant. Calling him reflected a strategy that carried risks; if he had been accepted, the chance of acquittal on Counts 6 and 6A was greatly increased, but once the jury rejected him, an adverse inference may well have been drawn.  
     13 The trial judge gave a direction about the relationship between the main counts and the alternative counts which, so far as Count 6A is concerned, might well be regarded as an extremely favourable one from the appellant’s point of view. He said: 
      
       
       “Now I have got to say this to you, it is always a matter for you, you are the jury, but you may well think, as I do, that if you find the accused not guilty of any one of those charges, you would find him not guilty of the alternate charge. The reason for that is that you are either going to accept beyond reasonable doubt her evidence. If you accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt, then it is going to ground those charges, that is the first charge in each one, and the alternative charge just will not raise its head. If you do not accept her evidence, then you would find him not guilty on both. 
        
       You have got to be very careful that you do not compromise. It might be a temptation, in some cases, for juries to have differing views, and to decide that they will compromise by finding someone guilty of the alternate charges, but not of the main charges. If you did that in this case, I believe, and it is a matter for you, I believe you would be wrong. I believe if you find him not guilty of the main charges, you should find him not guilty of the alternate charges. Having said that, it is always a matter for you, but I warn you to be very careful with them, and not to fall into that trap of reaching some sort of a compromise.”  
       
     14 For the jury’s benefit the trial judge in his summing up summarised the evidence of the complainant, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Murray, Mr Murray, the appellant and Mr Dufty in great detail. He read out the relevant part of the appellant’s record of interview, which consisted of denials. He prefaced his summary of the complainant’s evidence by saying: 
      
       
       “The Crown says that Julie’s evidence is corroborated, at least on one occasion. They say to you it is corroborated by her aunt, Lynette, who walked into the room and said she saw the accused on top of Julie. 
        
       Corroboration is evidence from a source other than Julie, which could possibly implicate the accused in the commission of the alleged offence. It must be evidence which shows, or tends to show, not only that the offence was committed, but that it was committed by the accused. I am required to tell you, and it is quite a simple matter, what material in the present case is relied upon as corroboration. It will then be for you, as the judges of the facts, to decide, firstly, whether you accept that material, and, secondly, if you do, whether you consider that it does confirm the alleged complainant’s possible account in a material way by tending to show not simply that the offence was committed, but that it was the accused who committed it.” 
       
     15 After the trial judge had summarised the evidence of Mrs Donnelly, Mrs Murray and Mr Murray, he said: 
      
       
       “You may well think that if you accept that evidence beyond reasonable doubt that that corroborates Julie’s version of what occurred on that night. It was argued by counsel for the accused that even if you accepted it, that it did not necessarily indicate sexual intercourse was taking place. Well that is a matter for you. You have Lynette’s evidence that the accused was naked, on top of Julie, who was naked. And it is a matter for you how you deal with that.” 
       
      The appellant did not complain about how the trial judge summed up on confirmation.  
       
     16 The first submission advanced on behalf of the appellant was that the verdict of guilty on Count 6A was inconsistent with all the verdicts of not guilty. However, no detailed argument in support of this submission was advanced, and it should be rejected. It was entirely reasonable that the jury might have acquitted on all the counts (i.e. all except Count 6 and Count 6A) on which there was no confirmation, but have arrived at a different conclusion on one or other of the counts, namely Count 6 and Count 6A, on which there was confirmation.  
     17 The next submission of the appellant was put thus: 
      
       
       “Is it possible to reconcile the verdict of guilty to count 6A and not guilty to count 6? At the very least the verdicts of not guilty in counts 1 to 5 and 8 establish an unwillingness of the jury to accept her assertions of sexual intercourse without the existence of some corroboration. Corroboration applied to both 6 and 6A. Corroboration came through aunt Lynette and is evidence independent of a complainant and tends to connect an accused with the crime. 
        
       In this case seeing the appellant lying between the legs of the complainant is clearly corroboration. It is not however direct evidence of all the elements of the offence, nor need it be. Significantly, it does not directly corroborate penile/vaginal penetration, nor dies it corroborate absence of consent or the use of force. It simply corroborates that an offence may have been committed by the then accused. If therefore the jury was influenced by evidence of corroboration it has on the face of it inferred that the evidence supported intercourse but not absence of consent. Such inference seems arbitrary given the unambiguous and stark evidence of the complainant. 
        
       That is to say, the corroboration applies equally to count 6 as it does to count 6A. Yet the jury has accepted part of the evidence of the complainant in respect of 6A, but not 6, without any discernible basis on the evidence. Any sense of comfort engendered by such corroboration to 6A should have applied to count 6. Corroboration can do no more than support the version of the complainant. 
        
       In finding the appellant not guilty of count 6 the jury has rejected the version of events given by the complainant. A verdict of guilty to count 6A disregards the complainant’s version which imported the forced separation of her legs and the covering of her mouth to prevent her talking or calling out to her aunt. Notwithstanding the trial judge’s admonition to the contrary (s/up. 10), the verdict has been a compromise.”  
       
     18 The appellant then referred to the following passage in Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 455: 
      
       
       “Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant with respect to the second count lacked sufficient cogency to convict, the Crown case on the first and third counts wore a different complexion.” 
       
       
      The appellant concluded by saying: 
       
       
       “In the instant case, the jury found that the evidence of the complainant lacked sufficient cogency to convict in respect of count 6, and there is nothing to provide more cogency for count 6A. The evidence of corroboration cannot rebuild the credit for count 6A, which is by implication impugned by virtue of the verdict to count 6.” 
       
     19 The Crown pointed out that Jones v R is not authority for the proposition that “a mixture of acquittals and convictions cannot be sustained unless the Court can detect a relevant difference in the quality of the complainant’s evidence”: R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [64]-[65]. The Crown pointed to the following observation of Spigelman CJ in that case at [125]: 
      
       
       “… a reasonable jury is not obliged to have a doubt about the occurrence of some incidents about which it has only a complainant’s uncorroborated evidence, if they have such a doubt about other incidents whenever, in the latter but not the former case, there is evidence contradictory of, or failing to support, the evidence of the complainant. Any conclusion about this matter depends on the full range of relevant circumstances.” 
       
      Simpson J, though dissenting in the result, did not dissent from the exposition of the law advanced by the Chief Justice, by Wood CJ at CL, and by Grove J. Carruthers AJ agreed with the Chief Justice.  
       
     20 To the above passages may be added the following remarks of Wood CJ at CL. At [203]-[205] he referred to authorities decided on Jones v R which: 
      
       
       “… appear to have reflected a presumption that, in such a case, absent the positive identification of some fact or surrounding circumstance providing a rational basis for accepting the complainant’s evidence on the counts of which the accused was found guilty, the other verdicts should be regarded by a Court of Criminal Appeal as unreasonable. 
        
       The rationale for such conclusion was that the rejection, by the jury, of the complainant’s evidence, in relation to the counts or counts upon which verdicts of not guilty were returned, involved a fatal diminution in that witness’s overall credibility. These decisions, accordingly, required the Crown, if it were to maintain the convictions, to point to circumstances that could positively restore the complainant’s credibility on the remaining counts, or to identify some rational basis for the jury having distinguished between the counts on which it returned verdicts of guilty and not guilty respectively. 
        
       Upon reflection, and with the benefit of a comprehensive review of the decisions to date, I have reached the conclusion that this line of decision has read too much into Jones, and has advanced a principle that is altogether too rigid.” 
       
       
      He then referred to the following passages in  
      MacKenzie v R 
       (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366-7: 
       
       
       “A convenient starting point is the decision of the High Court in  
       MacKenzie v The Queen 
        (1996) 190 CLR 348 where Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ emphasised, at 366: 
        
         
          
          ‘Where, as is ordinarily the case, the inconsistency arises in the jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process in a criminal trial, the test is one of logic and unreasonableness’. 
          
         
        
       
       
       As their Honours continued, at 367: 
        
         
          
          ‘ … the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate courts may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge’s instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt’.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      He then said (at [208]-[212]): 
       
       
       “The respect which is properly to be afforded to the constitutional role of the jury, and the advantage which it has in seeing and hearing the evidence unfold was recognised in  
       M v The Queen 
        (1984) 181 CLR 487 at 493, in a passage cited with approval in  
       Jones 
        at 451: 
        
         
          
          ‘ … the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay  
          full 
           regard to these considerations’.  
          (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
       
       It is with this fundamental respect for the role entrusted by the criminal justice system to the jury, to find the facts according to the evidence, that this court should apply the test enunciated in  
       M 
        at 494 to 495, and in  
       Jones 
       ,  
       when it is required to determine whether guilty verdicts are unreasonable and incapable of being supported. That test necessarily requires close reference to the evidence, since it was said in  
       M 
        at 494 to 495: 
        
         
          
          ‘… where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displayed inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
       In applying the decision in  
       Jones 
        it is not to be overlooked, as was made clear in the judgment at 455, that it was the combination of the credibility factor arising from the acquittal of the appellant on one count, ‘with the uncorroborated nature of the complaints,’ and the effect of the lengthy and unexplained delay in the making of the complaints, that led to the conclusion that the convictions were ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ (as the ground was conventionally described before the decision in  
       Fleming v The Queen 
        (1999) 197 CLR 250 and  
       R v Giam 
        (1999) NSWCCA 53). 
        
       These two additional factors, their Honours confirmed, made it ‘necessary’ or ‘essential’ for the jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence in the case with ‘considerable’ or ‘great care’. Additionally, there was the circumstance, to which considerable importance had been attached in  
       Longman v The Queen 
        (1987) 168 CLR 79, and  
       Crampton v The Queen 
        (2000) 75 ALJR 133, concerning the considerable difficulty which the defence may face in dealing with allegations made of events occurring many years in the past. 
        
       So understood, I do not regard  
       Jones 
        as an authority for the presumption previously mentioned. It does not deny to a jury the right to accept the evidence of a complainant in relation to one event, and to maintain a reasonable doubt about another event described by that witness. It leaves unimpaired the traditional instruction given to juries that they are not obliged to wholly accept or to wholly reject what a witness says, but are free to accept part and to reject part of his or her account.” 
       
     21 Is there a “proper way by which” this Court can reconcile the verdicts on Count 6 and Count 6A, to use the language of Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MacKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 366? 
     22 Count 6A required only proof of sexual intercourse. The unshaken testimony of Mrs Donnelly as to the state of undress of the appellant and the complainant, their relative positions, and the rather incredible statement of the appellant that he was only talking to the complainant, may not of itself have proved sexual intercourse beyond a reasonable doubt. But it unquestionably and very powerfully confirmed that part of the complainant’s evidence which complained of sexual intercourse, and made it safe to act on it. The trial judge said to the jury in relation to the defence argument that even if Mrs Donnelly’s evidence was accepted it did not necessarily indicate sexual intercourse: “Well that is a matter for you. You have Lynette’s evidence that the accused was naked, on top of Julie, who was naked. And it is a matter for you how you deal with that.” It would be strange if the jury had not been satisfied that sexual intercourse had taken place.  
     23 On the other hand, Mrs Donnelly’s evidence did not point nearly so strongly to lack of consent. Mrs Donnelly did give evidence that the complainant was upset. The fact that she seemed upset was capable of being attributed to the appellant’s alleged violence. It was also capable of being attributed to the fact that a 15 year old girl had been discovered by her aunt in the middle of an act of consensual intercourse. Even though Mrs Donnelly’s evidence was capable of confirming the complainant’s evidence that she had not consented, it was open to the jury to explain it in a different way or at least to experience a reasonable doubt about whether the Crown had negatived consent and proved that the appellant knew of or was reckless as to a lack of consent. Acceptance by the jury of the complainant’s evidence that there had been intercourse so as to lead to persuasion of its occurrence beyond a reasonable doubt was, in the light of Mrs Donnelly’s evidence, wholly unsurprising. It was not inconsistent with that acceptance and that persuasion that the jury failed to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to consent. 
     24 The jury must be credited with the possibility that they carried out their duty in considering the case presented on each count, including the alternative counts, separately, and considering in relation to each count whether or not all ingredients had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury saw the witnesses. It was open to the jury to acquit on all the counts lacking confirmation. It was also open to them to convict on Count 6A, where the confirming evidence was very strong, but to acquit on Count 6 where it was less strong. The jury was entitled to accept what the complainant said about sexual intercourse, but to experience a reasonable doubt about lack of consent. The Crown evidence on Count 6A did not contain discrepancies, inadequacies, taints or any want of probative force in such a way as to suggest to this Court a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. To some extent the submissions of the appellant suggested that so far as evidence in the nature of what at common law was known as corroboration did not prove the actual commission of the offence charged, it could not operate as being corroborative or confirmatory of the complainant’s evidence. That was not so at common law: R v Doney (1988) 37 A Crim R 288 at 297-8; Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 211. It is not so in relation to confirmatory evidence under the Evidence Act 1995 either. 
     25 Ground 1 is rejected. 
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
     26 This ground was: 
      
       
       “The direction of the learned trial judge in relation to evaluating the credit of the complainant having regard to delay in complaint was inadequate.” 
       
     27 The appellant submitted: 
      
       
       “The judge was obliged to give a direction in view of delay in complaint that the appellant had been placed at a disadvantage in defending himself and indicate what those disadvantages were. See Longman v The Queen 1989 168 CLR 70). The judge did this (s/u p.26). 
        
       The judge was also obliged in view of the delay in complaint to give two further directions. One is a statutory direction indicating a complainant may have good reason not to immediately complain. (See now s. 107 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and before this, corresponding terms in s. 405B Crimes Act 1900). The judge did this (s/u p. 27). 
        
       The other direction is to be given to balance the former in favour of an accused. It is to the effect that delay in complaint may be taken into account in assessment of the credit of the complainant 
        
       That a direction dealing with delay was proper was noted in Kilby v The Queen (1973) [129] CLR 460, where Barwick CJ said at 465 it would ‘… be proper for a trial judge to instruct a jury that in evaluating the evidence of a woman who claims to have been the victim of a rape and in determining whether to believe her, they could take into account that she had made no complaint at the earliest reasonable opportunity.’ This was a decision before provision in the nature of s107. This passage was cited with approval in Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 447, dealing with a s.107 type provision. The delay in that case was 6 months to 6 years. In this case it is 13 to 16 years. 
        
       The trial judge here gave a direction touching on these principles which was inadequate. He directed in this regard (s/u p.26): 
       
       
        
         
          
          I must warn you the mere absence of complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complainant is false.  
          It may indicate fabrication on the part of the complainant, but it does not necessarily do so 
          . There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted does not complain to anyone 
          . (Emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
       
       It is respectfully submitted that the effect of this direction is to ‘sandwich’ the Kilby/Croft direction (words emphasised) in favour of the accused, between two s.107 type directions in favour of the complainant. The s.107 direction was then repeated after the Longman direction, introduced with the words ‘… Now the other matter about complaint is this …’ (s/up.27pt7). This has so diminished the Kilby/Croft direction as to deny the appellant the balance in the direction to which he was entitled, and create an imbalance in the competing directions. 
        
       The Croft principle was considered in Regina v DJK NSWCCA 8th October 1997. The delay in complaint there was seven years. Hunt CJ at CL observed (p.9) in relation to a Kilby direction ‘… Such a direction remains appropriate notwithstanding the provision of s.405B.’ He then went on to observe in light of Crofts ‘… the High Court – accepting that such a direction is appropriate – has now said more specifically that the duty to give such a direction arises … to restore a  
       balance of fairness 
       .  
       (Emphasis added) 
        
       The part of the direction that related to delay in complaint affecting credit was further diminished by the attachment of the words ‘ … but it does not necessarily do so.’ 
        
       Counsel sought no redirection in relation to this point. It is submitted however that the matter is so important that the absence of balance has led to a miscarriage of justice. In relation to Ground 2, the leave of the Court is sought. (Rule 4).” 
       
     28 There is a degree of unreality in this submission. A “complaint” in this type of case means a statement by the victim to a third party making the allegation against the accused which is made in the victim’s testimony at the trial. Failure to complain for a long time may have a negative impact on the credibility of the victim’s testimony. Speedy complaint may enhance it. While these considerations were unquestionably material in relation to all counts except Count 6 and Count 6A, and may well have significantly contributed to the acquittals on all those other counts, they had more limited materiality in relation to Count 6, and very little materiality in relation to Count 6A. That is because the credit of the person complaining about sexual intercourse assumes a less crucial significance if another witness, whose evidence is itself corroborated by two other persons, observes matters pointing very strongly to the fact that sexual intercourse had just ceased. There would be little point in the complainant complaining to her aunt about the appellant’s behaviour when the aunt had just seen it for herself. Similarly, there would be little point in the complainant complaining to her mother when her aunt had just rushed off to see her mother and told her mother something which had had the result of her stepfather hurrying back to take her home.  
     29 Leaving that consideration aside, however, the criticism of the trial judge’s summing up based on a supposed failure to give the appellant the benefit of a warning about what flowed from her lack of complaint is to be rejected. The totality of what the trial judge said was as follows: 
      
       
       “Now there is another important issue in this case, and that is one relating to lack of complaint. There is, in effect, no evidence of complaint. Julie did not complain about what was happening. It is argued that you would have expected her to have complained. You would have expected her to tell her aunt or her mother or her cousin who she used to go and see, that these sort of things were going on. That is what you would have expected from her. That did not happen. And that is one of those matters, it is argued, which you should consider when you are looking at whether or not you can accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, she has said to you she did not complain. She said she was only young, she was very fond of her aunt, she did not think she would be believed, and, in effect, she did not complain. 
        
       Now that is a matter you will have to look at and consider when you are looking at her evidence. But there is a matter of law which I must put to you. I must warn you the mere absence of a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complainant is false. It may indicate fabrication on the part of the complainant, but it does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted does not complain to anyone. It is important, however, that I give you certain warnings. It is important that you appreciate fully the effects of absence of complaint on the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing prosecution evidence, to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. In this regard you will take into account that these matters happened, or are alleged to have happened many years ago. 
        
       What you have to consider is this – and this was a matter which was argued to you with some force – that because of these delays, the delays in making the complaint, the accused has a loss of means of testing the complainant’s allegations which possibly could have been open to him had they been made at an early time. Had the allegations been made soon after the alleged event it would have been possible to explore in detail the alleged circumstances, perhaps to adduce evidence throwing doubt upon the complainant’s story, or confirming the accused’s denial. But because of the delay, that opportunity may have passed. 
        
       The evidence of Julie perhaps could not be adequately tested after such a passage of time, and you must look very carefully at her evidence, and be satisfied of its truth and accuracy, bearing in mind there was a considerable delay. It was pointed out to you that the accused was at, or could have been at some difficulty in meeting some of these allegations because of the long lapse of time before a complaint was made. For instance, there may have been a medical examination which could have been held which may have assisted one way or the other. Perhaps there could have been forensic evidence. Perhaps there could have been records. People’s minds would be clearer closer to the event. That is a matter you will bear in mind when you are considering the case against the accused. 
        
       Now the other matter about complaint is this, that whilst there was no complaint – where there is no complaint or a considerable delay, I am required to say this to you, I must warn you that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false, and I must also inform you that there may be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making a complaint about the assault.”  
       
     30 This direction is much fuller than was suggested by the appellant’s argument. It is not correct to suggest that all the trial judge said was that lack of complaint “may indicate fabrication on the part of the complainant”. The first paragraph in the passage just quoted referred to an expectation of complaint. As Wood CJ at CL pointed out in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [244], it may be unwise to assume that immediate complaint of sexual assault is always to be expected. However, the direction complied with the law, and even if the direction assumed too much, the assumption made favoured the appellant. That first paragraph in the passage just quoted makes it plain that the failure of the complainant to meet the expectation of complaint left it open to conclude that there was nothing to complain about and that the complainant’s testimony that there was had been made up years later. The central significance of the plaintiff’s credibility in relation to what she said happened so many years earlier was made plain in that passage. It was also made plain in other passages. Thus at pages 16-17 of the summing up the trial judge said: 
      
       
       “It may be said that this case turns on a conflict between the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, and evidence of the accused, and indeed his witness. And you may ask yourself who is to be believed. But even if you think the prosecution witnesses are probably telling the truth, that does not conclude the issue whether the prosecution has proved the case against the accused. Even if you prefer the evidence of the prosecution, you should not convict the accused unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. It is, as has been said to you by both counsel, and I will say to you, you must accept on those important points the evidence of Julie beyond reasonable doubt before you can convict. 
        
       Mr Fuller said to you that he and Lynette had been together for seventeen years. He denied having sex with Julie. The occasion when Lynette walked into the loungeroom and saw him on top of Julie never happened. She never slapped him across the face. He was not alone in the house with Julie, there was always children there. He told you about Mr Dufty and how he was often there, they would go to the wrecking yard. Julie was often at the house. Sometimes she would come over with her friends, and, in effect, he denied each and every one of these charges. 
        
       In a case such as this, I would normally say to a jury, because of the facts surrounding it you must be very careful before you convict the accused. That is, you have a complainant who was a young girl at the time, the incidents are alleged to have happened many many years ago, there was no complaint made for many many years. It is the evidence of one person against another. And having said that, I might point out to you that in relation to sexual offences you may well think that most of those, when they do occur, occur in private, that you do not have a whole lot of witnesses. That is not unusual. And so normally I would say to you, you have got to be very very careful.”  
       
       
      At page 18 the trial judge said: 
       
       
       “If you decide there is no evidence which in your mind so confirms Julie’s account in such a material respect, then I warn you as a matter of law that you should exercise considerable caution before you convict the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of Julie, taking into account all those other matters I have put to you. You may do so, but before doing so, it is essential that you carefully scrutinise the evidence, that is the evidence of Julie.” 
       
       
      Even if, which is highly questionable, the significance of the lack of complaint in relation to the central question of the complainant’s credibility was not obvious, the trial judge made it plain.  
       
     31 Wood CJ at CL said in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290 at [249] that in that case it might be assumed, by reason inter alia of the terms in which the s 107 direction was given, particularly so far as it was expressed in terms that the delay “does not necessarily indicate” unreliability, and “there may be good reasons” for it, that the jury were well alive to the possibility that lengthy failure to complain could reflect upon the complainant’s credibility. That observation is applicable here to the words:  
      
       
       “[Absence of complaint] may indicate fabrication on the part of the complainant, but it does not necessarily do so. There may be good reasons why a person who has been sexually assaulted does not complain to anyone.”  
       
      Contrary to the appellant’s submission, those words do not impermissibly weaken the  
      Kilby 
       direction.  
       
     32 In the circumstances, the reason why the appellant’s counsel at the trial did not request a redirection was almost certainly because she saw no vice, from the point of view of her client’s interests, in the direction which was actually given.  
     33 Ground 2 is rejected. 
     34 WOOD CJ at CL: Ground 1 and 2 of the appeal as lodged should be dismissed for the reasons provided by the presiding judge.  
     35 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     36 HEYDON JA: The court makes the following order and directions: 
      
       
      1. Order that Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal as lodged be dismissed.  
       
       
      2. Direct that: 
       
       
      (a) any affidavits to be relied on by the appellant, in relation to the issue the subject of discussion at the start of this appeal, together with any Amended Notice of Appeal, to be filed on or before Friday, 26 October 2001; 
       
       
      (b) in the event that the appellant decides not to proceed with the application to rely on further evidence the appellant to file in the Registry a document indicating the decision to withdraw the application; 
       
       
      (c) the Crown file any affidavits it wishes to rely on, in answer to affidavits filed by the appellant, on or before 11 November 2001. 
       
       
      (d) it be noted that if it is not reasonably practicable for the Crown to comply with direction 3 above that the Crown have liberty, without prejudice, to apply for an extension of time.  
       
       
      (e) the matter to be listed before the Registrar on Monday, 12 November 2001.

     LANZA V CODEMO MANAGEMENT PTY LTD t/a YOOGALI ENGINEERING CO 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   WOOD CJ AT CL: The plaintiff, Guiseppe Lanza, became a quadriplegic as a result of an accident at his place of work in Griffith, on 27 June 1996. He brings these proceedings for damages in respect of the injuries sustained. 
     
      
     THE ACCIDENT 
      
    2   The accident occurred while the plaintiff was working from the bucket of a mobile cherry picker, a form of elevated work platform (EWP) attached to a late 1960’s model Austin truck owned by his employers (“Yoogali”). The cherry picker had been built in 1967 and purchased by Yoogali from the Murrumbidgee County Council in the mid 1980’s. 
    3   The plaintiff was, at the time of the accident, assisting two other men, his brother Marco Lanza, and Mathew Smart, to lift a beam and attached door track, which was to be welded to purlins on either side of the doorway to the shed that they were constructing. The EWP was about 5 metres above the ground, and comprised a bucket whose dimensions were 1260mm, by 620mm, by 920mm deep.  
    4   Although narrow, the bucket permitted a man, standing within it, to crouch down to reach tools required for the job at hand. It was being used, at the time of the accident, to support the beam which the other two workmen were hauling up by ropes slung over the purlins. 
    5   The plaintiff was wearing a levitator safety harness, with a December 1995 manufacture date, attached to his upper body with straps over the shoulders and in between his legs. At the rear of the harness there was a D ring attached to an extendable tension strap. That tension strap, which performed the function of an energy absorber, was contained within a pocket, and was secured by sacrificial stitching. In the event of a fall, the sacrificial stitching was designed to break, thereby activating the energy absorber, that would help break the wearer’s fall. 
    6   An essential element of this fall arrest system, when in use, was the connection of the harness to a fixed point, preferably located at or above the height of the D ring, by way of a lanyard. The lanyard in use was about 1.8m long, and consisted of a plastic coated galvanised 7mm wire cable to which hooks were swaged at each end. They were rated to have a load bearing capacity of 25 kn, well in excess of the relevant Australian standard. One end of this lanyard was intended to be hooked onto the D ring of the harness. The remote or free end was intended to be hooked onto a fixed point, in the present case an eyelet or ring located on the top of the bucket. 
    7   The hooks were provided with a spring-loaded keeper, which was backed up by a spring loaded latch. This latch had to be depressed to disengage the tongue of the keeper which automatically closed around the load by spring tension. 
    8   So designed, and assuming all connections were properly made, the harness and lanyard were intended for use as a last resort safety device to arrest the wearer in the event of a fall. 
    9   The plaintiff’s accident occurred just as, or immediately after, he had crouched down to pick up either a spanner or welder hand piece from the bottom of the bucket. Unfortunately, at that moment, a glass fibre reinforced plastic (GRP) rod, which was part of the levelling mechanism of the bucket, and which was attached to a wire cable, broke as a result of its incomplete lamination, tipped the bucket forward, and propelled the plaintiff from it. The harness did not arrest his fall onto the concrete below. 
    10   Immediately after the accident it was seen that the remote end of the lanyard was still attached to the eyelet in the bucket. The hook that should have engaged the other end of the lanyard to the harness was not however engaged, and the sacrificial stitching used to hold the shock absorber was intact, indicating that it had not been placed under a full load. No damage was found to the hooks or the catches, and the hook was found to be functioning correctly. The plaintiff was still wearing the harness, which was cut from him by the ambulance officers called to the scene. 
    11   It was common ground, as confirmed by all the experts, that the cause of the failure of the levelling mechanism was the defective state of the GRP rod, it being agreed by them that the cherry picker was being used well within its safe recommended load of 500 lbs. It was also common ground that proper inspection and maintenance of the cherry picker should have picked up the defective and potentially dangerous condition of the GRP rod. 
     
      
     THE PLAINTIFF’S CLAIM AND THE CROSS CLAIMS 
      
    12   The quantum of the plaintiff’s damages have been agreed by all parties, who also accept that the accident was one that falls within the ambit of the Motor Accidents Act 1988. It operates to the exclusion of the Workers Compensation Act 1987, so far as the assessment of common law damages is concerned in relation to the plaintiff’s employers. (S151E(2) of the Motor Accidents Act). For the purpose of the Motor Accidents Act, damages were agreed at $5m plus costs. At common law, free of any legislative cap, they were agreed at $6.2m. plus costs. 
    13   The proceedings were brought by the plaintiff against the following defendants: 
     
     a) First and second defendants - Codemo Management Pty Ltd and Lanza Management Pty Ltd, Trading as Yoogali Engineering Company (“Yoogali”) the employers of the plaintiff and the owners of the mobile EWP. 
      
     b) Third Defendant - proceedings discontinued; 
      
     c) Fourth Defendant - Fallright International Pty Ltd (“Fallright”) the supplier of the safety hook to Kuba; 
      
     d) Fifth Defendant - Kuba Pty Ltd trading as Illawarra Wire Ropes (“Kuba”) - the supplier to Yoogali of the harness, together with the lanyard (which it either took out of stock or made up) and of the hook, all of which components it supplied to Yoogali as a complete item, after repacking; 
      
     e) Sixth Defendant - Moxham Industries Pty Ltd (“Moxham”) the manufacturer and supplier of the safety harness to Kuba. 
      
    14   The proceedings against Fallright, and Moxham, were based upon common law negligence, and also upon S 75AD of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The proceedings against Kuba were based upon common law negligence alone. 
    15   Liability to the plaintiff has been admitted by Yoogali, by reason of breaches of the duty of care owed by it in relation to the operation, maintenance and use of the EWP, and in particular in relation to the failure to inspect and detect the extensive surface cracking of the GRP rod that should have led to its replacement. In this regard, it was the case that the relevant Australian Standard called for major inspections of all components after 10 years service and thereafter at 5 yearly intervals. A verdict and judgment have been entered accordingly. 
    16   No other defendant has admitted liability. All defendants have, however, conceded that there was no contributory negligence by the plaintiff.  
    17   Each of the defendants has brought a cross claim against the others for contribution or indemnity under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946. Cross claims have also been framed by some of the defendants pursuant to contract. Those additional cross claims were raised late in the proceedings and have been stood over for further determination, if required. This judgment is confined to the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act claims for relief. 
    18   Additionally, but alone, Fallright has brought a cross claim against SSE, the designer and manufacturer of the hook that was supplied by Fallright to Kuba, on-sold to Yoogali, and then clipped onto the lanyard used by the plaintiff. 
     
      
     THE ISSUES 
      
      
    19   The issues that remain in the case concern the following matters: 
     
      
     a) Why did the harness not arrest the plaintiff’s fall? 
      
      
     b) If the hook was securely clipped to the harness, but suffered roll out, was its design defective, so as to give rise to liability on the part of Fallright and/or SSE? 
      
      
     c) Did Moxham fail to supply proper instructions with the harness in relation to its use, so as to give rise to liability on its part in relation to the marketing, packaging and labelling of the product? 
      
      
     d) Did the intermediate supplier, Kuba, fail to take precautions in relation to the marketing, packaging and labelling of the complete unit which it supplied to Yoogali? 
      
      
     e) Is the plaintiff entitled to recover damages against any defendant under the Trade Practices Act, if the components respectively manufactured or supplied by them were defective, or if insufficient instructions were supplied, or does S 75I of the Act exclude any such recovery? 
      
      
     f) If any defendant, other than Yoogali, is liable to the plaintiff, what are the respective proportionate responsibilities of those defendants who are liable to the plaintiff? 
      
      
     g) If any of the defendants, in addition to Yoogali, are found liable to the plaintiff and become entitled to contribution or indemnity against Yoogali, then does the Motor Accidents Act limit the overall liability of that party to the sum of $5m, or is the cap provided under that Act inapplicable in relation to claims for contribution or indemnity? 
      
    20   For an understanding of the issues which arise, and which overlap to a considerable degree, it is necessary to record the circumstances in which Yoogali came to acquire the safety harness and attachments, and to note the competing contentions as to the reasons for the plaintiff’s fall from the bucket once the levelling mechanism broke. 
    21   About six months before the accident (more precisely 23 November 1995) safety inspectors from Workcover found the plaintiff working at the Seaton’s bakery site, from the EWP, without a safety harness. This occurred even though Yoogali had, available for its staff, and the plaintiff used from time to time, a general purpose belt harness. Both the plaintiff and Yoogali were fined. As a consequence, in about March 1996, Yoogali approached Kuba and made known its need for a safety harness suitable for use on its EWP. 
    22   Mr Mitchell of Yoogali gave evidence of the circumstances in which this information was supplied, and a purchase was made. He phoned Kuba and said that Yoogali had been fined and required a harness suitable for use in a cherry picker, and in other elevated work positions. The employee Andrew, to whom he spoke, said that there was a product that would generally serve their needs. He then faxed down some pages of the catalogue to show the product they were talking about (which was circled) together with the prices. Mr Mitchell sent an order of confirmation, dated 7 March 1996, for two safety harnesses with lanyards which were then supplied. The lanyards were wrapped in individual plastic bags, and the harnesses were contained in fabric storage bags. They were unaccompanied by any manual or instructional pamphlet. No warning or advice was given orally in relation to any matter of which the user should be aware in using the product, or of the safety precautions that could and should be taken. 
    23   Whether any instructions or swing tags had been attached to the harness itself by Moxham was not established.  
    24   The plaintiff said that he was certain that the hook had been securely attached to the D ring before the accident. In this regard, he said that the D ring was positioned about mid back, and that he felt the weight of the lanyard dragging down from that position after he hooked up. His brother similarly said that he saw it hanging down from his back, before the accident occurred. No party seriously challenged the evidence of either witness in this regard. I see no reason not to accept it. 
    25   The fact is that although the hook and harness were connected before the fall, they were found disengaged immediately afterwards. Two possibilities, and only two possibilities were advanced to explain that event: 
     
      
     a) the condition of “roll out” which can occur when the latches of the hook that hold the jaws secure are subject to pressures permitting it to open; or 
      
     b) imperfect, ie mistaken attachment of the hook to the D ring, leading to disengagement when strain is applied to it by a fall. 
      
    26   It was accepted that, for all practical purposes, these possibilities were mutually exclusive. If the hook had been properly attached to the D ring, then roll out must have occurred. If, however, it was imperfectly attached to the webbing or obstructed by clothing, then almost certainly the force of the fall would have caused the hook to detach.  
    27   In relation to the roll out possibility two scenarios capable of triggering that event, were developed. An understanding of each requires an examination of the design features of the opening and closing mechanism of the hook, which was known as a double action hook. To open it, pressure has to be applied to the two latches which are located in opposing positions. The application of opposing compression forces on the two latches will permit the jaws of the hook to be opened. 
    28   The first scenario for roll out accordingly involved the accidental application of those opposing compression forces, on one hypothesis, when the plaintiff crouched in the bucket, and pressed one side of the hook against the bucket, while the other side of the hook was sitting at right angles to his body. In that position, if the other side of the hook was pressed up against his body, particularly against the hard pack containing the extending strap, then, it was suggested, the combination of the opposing forces could permit the jaws to be released, after which the hook could slide off the D ring. This requires a somewhat unique, although not entirely impossible, combination of circumstances involving pressure imposed in opposite directions at virtually the same time and the positioning of the D ring in a critical configuration so that contact on one side could activate both latches, and also so that the open hook could then slide off the D ring.  
    29   An alternative scenario for roll out that was explored requires the same combination of critical configuration and opposing pressures, occurring after the fibreglass rod broke and the EWP tipped forward. This hypothesis supposed accidental contact, and the application of opposing pressure on the latches, occurring in the course of the plaintiff’s fall, i.e. it supposed a situation in which the plaintiff struck the side of the bucket, or some other hard object, as he fell releasing him from the harness before he struck the ground. 
    30   The other possibility of imperfect connection was advanced by the plaintiff, by Yoogali, and by Fallright, as the more likely. It began with the proposition that since it was difficult, if not impossible for the wearer of the harness to visually see or check the connection, he was forced to rely upon sound, or upon a good tug on the lanyard, after connection, to tell whether he was securely hooked up. In these circumstances, it was said there were several possibilities for imperfect connection, including connecting the hook onto or into the webbing attached to the D ring, or to the sides of the D ring, or connecting it in a position where it was left slightly open because of clothing becoming inadvertently jammed in its jaws. As was demonstrated during the trial, any such imperfect attachment could give the user the impression, since it could sound the same and since it could survive a firm test tug, depending on where and how attachment was made, that the hook was properly connected. 
    31   I will return to these alternatives later when I came to consider the liability of the defendants other than Yoogali. In the meantime, it is appropriate to note that the possibility of inadvertent yet incomplete hook up by a worker, exercising due care for himself, was conceded by all parties, as a reasonable possibility, particularly in a noisy or busy workplace. It was for that reason that contributory negligence was not pressed by any defendant. 
    32   Some possible solutions to avoid imperfect hook up were canvassed, including: 
     
      
     a) clipping on before donning the harness;  
      
      
     b) moving the position of the D ring higher up the back, or extending the length of the strap; or providing a pack tensioning device that would, in each case, allow the D ring to be pulled out to a position where the connection could be more easily checked visually by the wearer; or  
      
      
     c) by ensuring that a co-worker independently made the connection or checked its integrity. 
      
    33   In relation to the hook, some other connecting devices were suggested to be preferable, including: 
     
      
     a) a screw gate swivelling hook; 
      
      
     b) a karabiner, or  
      
      
     c) a different form of double action hook that would not disengage if subjected to a compression force applied on one side. 
      
    34   As I have observed, because of the difficulty of reproducing in the work place, the precise circumstances in which inadvertent or unexpected pressure on the hook could result in roll out, it was all but conceded that it was improbable in the extreme, that it was the reason for the hook becoming detached in the present case. Upon a balance of probabilities, it was accepted by all parties other than Moxham that the cause was far more likely to have been imperfect connection. 
    35   Moxham, however, submitted that, in the absence of any sign of damage to the webbing, there was nothing positively pointing to imperfect connection as the cause. Further it submitted that, in circumstances where a particular event could be related to two independent and exclusive causes, even though one was highly improbable, neither logic nor any theory of probability could favour one of those causes over the other. The plaintiff, it was submitted, could not establish, or eliminate, in this case, either scenario as a possible cause of detachment. The consequence, so it was submitted, was that, absent a positive finding as to the reason for the plaintiff’s harness becoming disengaged, liability could not be attributed to any of the defendants, other than Yoogali. In view of that submission it is necessary to resolve the issue thus raised as to the cause of disengagement in this case.  
     
      
     THE HARNESS DID NOT ARREST THE PLAINTIFF’S FALL 
      
    36   In light of that background, and those competing contentions, I turn to the evidence of the plaintiff as to his practice, and as to what he recalled of the accident; and to the expert evidence concerning the harness and the matters that need to be taken into account for its safe use. 
    37   The plaintiff gave evidence that he always wore the harness, when working from the cherry picker, once it was acquired. This followed upon the general instruction from his father, following the earlier prosecution, to all staff, that anyone who went up in the bucket without wearing the harness would be dismissed. He said that he was not given any specific advice by anyone in respect of the way in which the harness was to be attached, save for some general instructions from his brother as to the way in which it was to be buckled up and adjusted. He also said that he did follow the instructions printed on the indelible label of the harness.  
    38   He said that he was never warned of the possibility of imperfectly securing the hook to the D ring or webbing, or of the integrity of the hook being interfered with by clothing, or of the need to have a co-worker check the connection, or as to the advisable sequence of attaching the lanyard to the harness and the fixed point. 
    39   He said that it was his practice to place on the harness first, and then to hook the lanyard onto the D ring, with his right hand behind his back at waist level. He also said that it was not possible for the wearer to visualise the connection being made between the hook and D ring, when following this procedure. 
    40   In chief, he said that he had no particular recollection of how it was that he fitted the harness, and effected the connection, on the day of the accident. However, I see no reason to believe that he followed other than his usual practice, particularly in the light of the two pieces of evidence previously mentioned. The first was his own evidence that he recalled, before the accident, feeling the weight of the lanyard dragging on his back, and “collecting” him when he moved about. The second was that of his brother Marco, who said that he saw the lanyard hanging down from the harness before the plaintiff fell from the bucket. 
    41   The plaintiff conceded, in cross examination by Counsel for Fallright, that he could not recall whether he tugged on the harness after he attached it. When cross examined by Counsel for Kuba he said, initially, that he checked the attachment by moving the hook to see if it would shift around inside the D ring. He later corrected this by saying that the check consisted of pulling on the cable, rather than moving it from side to side. “It felt right so I kept working”. 
    42   He made it clear, in cross examination, that he connected the lanyard to the harness after putting it on and that this occurred after he got into the bucket. 
    43   It was his recollection that, immediately before the bucket tipped, he had crouched down to pick up the welder, which was in front of him in the bucket. The controls were behind him, he agreed in cross examination, when he did this. He was not aware whether the back of the harness was touching the bucket, but he believed it “would have been fairly close”. He was also not sure whether, in the dynamics of the bucket tilting, his back was struck by it before he fell out, although he thought that may have occurred.  
    44   It was established that he had been wearing a jumper and jeans positioned beneath the harness, in the way that was recommended. Moreover, he said that the exercise with the cherry picker occupied 5 to 10 minutes, a period of sufficiently short duration as to have made it unlikely that he would have deliberately disconnected the lanyard from the harness, between the time of the initial connection and the fall. 
    45   It is possible that the plaintiff was in error in his recollection that he bent down to pick up the hand piece to the welder. His brother Marco thought that he was looking instead for a spanner to remove some bolts from the purlins which were in the way. Nothing, however, turns on this difference in their accounts, it being common ground that the plaintiff did crouch down facing the open doorway and beam, just before the fibreglass rod snapped, and that when he did so, his shoulders went below the rim of the bucket. 
    46   I turn next to the expert witnesses who were called in relation to the likely reason for disengagement of the hook, and in particular in relation to the question whether it was due to roll out or to an unrealised but imperfect connection. In the course of their evidence some attention was given to the development of the Australian Standard, to industry knowledge, to alternative forms of hook and lock, to alternative ways of connecting the lanyard hook to the D ring, and to alternative ways of checking the integrity of that connection. 
    47   It became clear from their evidence that the problem of roll out had been well recognised, in relation to single action hooks, leading to the introduction of double action hooks. The Australian Standard 1891.1.1995, that was published in March of that year, ie prior to the supply of the subject harness, gave recognition to this so far as it called for double action hooks rather than single action hooks, and so far as it replaced the 1983 standard. 
    48   In the plaintiff’s case, Dr John 0lsen, an occupational health, safety and rehabilitation consultant, was called. It became clear that he had no substantial complaint in relation to the design of the harness, which he thought complied with the 1995 standard. He also thought it was the right harness for the kind of work which Yoogali undertook. His principal concern, it appeared, was with the hook design, which he said “was such that to disengage the two locks of the double action, compression only was required. This is unlike some double action hooks where tension is required on one side.” One such hook, that was available in 1998, was demonstrated in a Fallright catalogue which was an attachment to his report. Another was the Karabiner type hook. 
    49   The hook used in the present case did not, in his view, comply with clause 3.3.2 of the 1995 Standard which specified that the springs of the snap hooks are to “be loaded so that when the latches are closed the springs rest in position and are constrained from any movement until deliberate pressure is applied to engage or release the latch”; and further specified that “in order to reduce the probability of involuntary opening, snap hooks and karabiners should be capable of being opened only by at least two consecutive deliberate actions.” 
    50   He said that he had been able to simulate an accidental opening by applying pressure, in a single direction, on the side of the locking plate of the hook when attached to the harness, ie in a way not requiring two consecutive deliberate actions. He demonstrated this event in the witness box, although not without considerable difficulty.  
    51   It became apparent that this could only occur in the rare circumstance where the D ring and hook were so configured that, pressure applied directly inwards against the locking plate would generate a reciprocal pressure outwards, when the hook was pressed against the shock absorbing part of the harness. That, he said, would then activate the locks, and allow the D ring to slide out of the hook.  
    52   In the manner first demonstrated by Dr Olsen, the curve of the D ring was in the uppermost position, the hook was allowed to sag slightly to the left with the eye toward the body of the wearer and the pressure was applied to the safety latch. The same event was demonstrated with the hook reversed, ie with the eye pointing outwards. In this configuration pressure from the wearer’s side activated the safety latch, permitting the hook to snap off, provided it swivelled sideways. 
    53   The force required to open the main latch, Dr Olsen explained was one of 2kgs, a force which had to be applied in exactly the correct direction, differing according to the way in which the hook was positioned. 
    54   Dr Olsen conceded that “roll out” occurring in either of these ways would be “necessarily rare” although each was “a possibility”. He regarded the exercise undertaken as one involving a simultaneous action, in the sense that it depended upon the generation of simultaneous, reciprocal but opposing forces. 
    55   He acknowledged that he had not endeavoured to simulate roll out by a blow to the hook as distinct from a sustained pressure upon it. He also acknowledged that the safety catch had to be depressed for some distance before the hook would open, and that there had to be a sideways movement for the open hook to come off the D ring. He further agreed that the natural tendency of the hook and lanyard was to follow the forces of gravity to the floor, thereby pulling the D ring downwards, and that it was also the natural tendency of the hook, once slipped into the D ring, to lie to one side or another, rather than to sit perpendicular to the back. 
    56   It follows that the second simulation of roll out that he demonstrated was less likely to occur since the optimum circumstances for it required the hook to be as close as possible to 90 degrees to the wearer’s back. Although, for the first simulated roll out that he demonstrated, the D ring was at an angle, he acknowledged that it also could not occur where the D ring was flat against the wearer’s back. 
    57   Apart from the double acting tension and compression hook that he thought appropriate, Dr Olsen said that a Karabiner would have been a better option since it could not be opened by a single pressure. He did, however, acknowledge that the Karabiner would be more fiddly to use, particularly if secured to a D ring behind the wearer’s back, because of the need to twist the screw that brings it to a closed position. Moreover, he conceded that a user may not be able to tell whether the screw gate was fully closed, that Karabiners are able to work themselves undone through vibration and possibly through rubbing against clothing, and that some wearers may not bother to screw up a knurled mechanism of the kind deployed in a Karabiner. 
    58   The double acting tension and compression hook he thought would be easier to use than the Karabiner, but “slightly more difficult” to operate than the one used on the plaintiff’s harness. 
    59   Another alternative means of connection that was explored, in cross examination of this witness, was the one that employed a mechanism permitting permanent, or at least semi permanent closure, and that can only be undone, once fixed, with an implement such as a screwdriver, spanner or pair of pliers. One that Dr Olsen spoke of was a shackle. Another, that was identified in the evidence of Dr. Turner, was a tube nut connector, normally referred to by its brand name, Maillon, that can be made even more secure by application of Lock Tight glue. 
    60   The other aspect of the case explored by Dr. Olsen related to the method of attachment of the hook to the D ring. One possible solution for improvement that he offered, involved a small extension of the D ring strap, by about 300 to 400mm, to improve the ability of the wearer to visualise the connection. Another solution was to make that connection before donning the harness, or to have someone else make the connection.  
    61   The problem of effective connection that he identified in this regard, was that previously mentioned, namely the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of the wearer being able to see the D ring on the harness when attempting to attach the hook to it, with the risk of incomplete closure due to some impediment, or due to connection to the webbing or some part of the harness other than the D ring. 
    62   In cross examination, he admitted that the provision of an extended D ring strap would cause the lanyard and ring to hang lower on the body of the wearer than the preferable mid back point of attachment. This, he conceded, could present its own dangers, so far as the attachment may become more prone to compression through leaning against or pushing against other objects, if worn at waist level, and in so far as there would be a greater likelihood of snagging. His evidence in relation to this aspect of the case is best encapsulated in the following answer: 
     
      
       
       “If you look at the purposes that you might put this harness to, it is probably better to have it the way it is. For use in a cherry picker, I would rather have the extension.” 
       
      
    63   Finally, Dr Olsen was of the view that it would have been desirable for the harness to contain an indelible instruction, in respect of the security of the connection of the lanyard onto the D ring. That, he said, might also include instructions to the effect that the connection ought to be made before the harness was donned, and/or that its integrity should be checked by a co-worker, and/or that the connection should be made by the co-worker. He agreed, in cross examination, that it was not possible to warn against every possible mishap, and that warnings should be confined “to the main risk associated with the use of the equipment”. 
    64   Dr Olsen made it clear that he was unwilling, if not unable, to determine which of the possible competing causes of detachment identified, had occurred in this case, regarding this as a matter for the Court. 
    65   Dr Turner, an engineer employed by Workcover New South Wales and Chairman of the Standards Australia Committee for Industrial Belts and Harnesses, was called in the case of Fallright. He was asked to examine the subject harness and lanyard after the accident, in order to report on the suitability and condition of its components. The effect of his report was that the hooks used were properly to be regarded as double action hooks, within the intent of the Standard. He also said that the signage and markings on the harness conformed with clause 5.2 of the 1995 Australian Standard. He found no fault with any of the individual components. 
    66   He agreed that, while the 1995 standard had led to a great improvement, double action hooks were not infallible, and that, dependent upon them being placed in a particular orientation, they were still susceptible to simulated roll out. 
    67   So far as the 1995 Standard dealt with the need for deliberate pressure to engage and release the latches, he said that he regarded this as directed to the need for the spring not to be in tension when the lock is closed; and also to the need to ensure that when the device was closed, the spring was contained and not vulnerable to being activated accidentally by a side load or by some external object pushing against it. 
    68   His evidence in relation to this aspect of the case, and in particular the likelihood of there having been a roll out through compression, is best encapsulated in the following passage of his evidence:  
     
      
       
       “Basically to achieve a roll out you need the hook and the connection to be in a particular orientation with respect to each other to actually achieve that and most of the orientations are difficult to maintain other than by holding them tight, tightly by your hand. If you were to hold them by the lanyard you may not be able to achieve that orientation because the components would naturally tend to move away from that orientation.” 
        
       
      
    69   He regarded the Fallright (SSE) hook as safe to use in relation to fall arrest equipment, and added that he was unaware of any problem with its use in the workplace. In a letter to the plaintiff'’s solicitors dated 25 March 1999, he said that it was acknowledged that some double acting hooks were susceptible to simulated roll out, and that the hooks involved in the accident “were one of the easiest to demonstrate this potential”. In the course of his cross examination he explained that he was speaking of simulated roll out. He accepted that while roll out with a hook of the kind used here was extremely rare, that could occur if both sides of the locking mechanism were compressed by an action in a single direction, ie if it could be held and retained in the correct orientation, and the necessary movement of the hook on the D ring could be achieved. 
    70   He agreed that there were locks available in 1995, including those in the Fallright catalogue that could not suffer hasp unlocking as the result of pressure in a single direction, and required separate and consecutive movements for that to occur. However, he said, they could also be shown to roll out in a different circumstance, ie if the lanyard was twisted in a particular way, albeit that it would be “very rare and very difficult to achieve” the necessary orientation, and “in real life virtually impossible “to do so”.  
    71   Karabiners, he said, were appropriate for use with fall arrest equipment. They had advantages in terms of their light weight and flexibility of use; and disadvantages so far as they may not meet the standard for strength when loaded across the gate, so far as they depend on the worker winding the knurled nut up tight to secure a lock, so far as they tend to go missing in the workplace (because of their other potential uses), and so far as they can become undone by rubbing up against another surface or object (if done up finger tight) or through vibration. He pointed out that they can also give a false positive if screwed up tight against some obstruction in the gate, especially if done up out of sight. 
    72   The semi permanent or permanent connectors, such as the maillon, he said could overcome this problem but they could also cause problems in certain applications, for example, where the worker had to move around because of the risk of having the lanyard caught or snagged. Additionally, he said the use of a permanently fixed lanyard could be uncomfortable if the worker was required to get into a vehicle, in which event it might dig into his back. The risk of tube nut connectors coming undone through vibration or friction, he said could be overcome by the application of Lock Tight glue, and to that extent they had an advantage over karabiners. 
    73   It was his experience that wearers of harnesses of the kind used in this case made the D ring connection by going over the top rather than from below (the way that the plaintiff did it). He had not seen any difficulty with this, and he did not regard it as a dangerous or inadvisable practice to hook up after the harness was donned. 
    74   He also did not see any difficulty in the way of a worker making a physical check himself to confirm proper connection. This he said was normally done by giving the hook a wiggle to check that it was moving freely within the D ring. 
    75   He did, however, agree in cross examination, that any form of safety equipment that involved a worker attaching something behind his back, had inherent dangers arising out of the fact that the worker could not see the precise point of attachment and that in the hustle and bustle of work, a mistake could genuinely be made when effecting the attachment. He also conceded that if the hook had been firmly attached to the webbing or clothing of the worker, then a pull on the lanyard may leave the worker with the incorrect belief that he was properly attached. He did, however, indicate that it would be more likely, if there were an imperfect connection, for the hook to pull off whatever it was attached to, when tugged. Another false positive that could appear to an operator, in the event of the hook being enmeshed in the clothing or webbing, he accepted, was the reassurance of the weight of the lanyard. 
    76   In relation to the provision of additional instructions upon the harness, Dr. Turner pointed out that there was a limitation, in a practical sense, in that there was not a large amount of room available. 
    77   By reason of his belief that there was nothing inherently unsafe in connecting the hook to the D ring after the harness was in place, he did not think, subject to one qualification, that there was any point in placing upon it any additional instruction or warning of the kind that Dr. 0lsen had identified. The qualification was expressed in the following terms:285 
     
      
       
       “If it was not possible to do a physical check I would agree there should be some sort of instruction to get another person to check it or to put it on first or to do something else that removes that problem, yes.” 
       
      
      
    78   Generally, in relation to instructions and the attitude of the Australian Standards Committee, he said: 286 
     
      
       
       “One of the problems with harnesses is actually convincing people to wear them in the first place and the larger and bulkier they are to make room for signage the less likely they would be to be worn, so the committee has actually looked at that aspect and decided that whilst there is a whole host of information that could possibly be put on, especially to allow them to be used by, say, an untrained person who would just simply read what is on the harness, it was considered that they should only be used by persons who have had some training in their use and are competent to use them and a lot of things would be covered in that training and most would be self evident anyway, but would be worth reinforcing in either an instruction sheet that goes with it and/or in the training.” 
        
       
      
    79   He agreed that there was room for a stark warning to be included on the harness as to the need for integrity in the connection, although he thought it would be less important than a number of other possible warnings. 
    80   He also agreed that it was a reasonable condition to apply to the equipment that its use be limited to “trained personnel aware of the dangers of the conditions” in which it was to be used, and that “use by persons without appropriate training and incapable of assessing the danger of conditions of use"" should be prohibited. Additionally, he agreed that it was reasonable that these matters be brought to the attention of a potential user, by way of operation manual or safety pamphlet or otherwise. 
    81   In Dr Turner’s letter to the plaintiff’s solicitor, previously mentioned, he also drew attention to the different work practices which might follow, dependent upon whether the lanyard used was a fibre rope or webbing lanyard, or a heavier wire lanyard. In normal work conditions he thought that a worker using the heavier lanyard was more likely to disconnect from the harness end, than from the bucket end, because of the inconvenience of carrying the lanyard around; whereas the worker with the lighter lanyard was more likely to disconnect from the bucket end. 
    82   Each, he pointed out, had its own problems. Reconnection to the harness involved a connection out of view, which “introduced the potential to catch clothing in the hook and prevent correct closure … thus negating the latching mechanism and significantly increasing the likelihood of the hook becoming detached”. While leaving the lanyard connected to the bucket had the potential of making it “easier to forget to reconnect upon re-entering the bucket.” Notwithstanding these risks he did not consider it necessary for this to be the subject of any specific instruction, since it depended on the work that was being undertaken, the type of lanyard in use and other considerations. 
    83   As to the reason for the failure of the safety equipment in the present case, Dr. Turner thought it unlikely, but not impossible, to get a roll out from the dynamics of the plaintiff moving about in the bucket. In particular, he indicated that, while he accepted that roll out could be simulated if the hook was held in the correct orientation, he expected that in use, it would fall sideways, ie in a position where it would be unlikely to receive the compression forces that would activate it. 
    84   The more likely scenario he thought (assuming initial attachment) was a false hook up to the webbing, or interference to full hook closure attributable to an obstruction. 
    85   The final expert called in the trial, also in Fallright’s case, was Dr. Emerson, a safety engineer, who formerly was a safety officer with the Sydney County Council. It was his view that the individual components that made up the harness, in this case, were suitable for use in general purpose applications, taking into account the need for compatibility, and also the fact that the effectiveness of the device was subject to its weakest link. He also said that this kind of equipment was specifically designed for people working in elevated places or platform vehicles, and was therefore aimed at a market of users who, in the ordinary course, would be expected to receive ongoing training in their use. 
    86   So far as the lanyard was concerned, he noted that there may be a slight inconvenience factor in the added weight of the 7mm steel wire lanyard, as compared with the lighter fibre lanyard. On the other hand, the effect of gravity would be more likely to keep it in its optimum location when it was less likely to twist in the way that might lead to the inadvertent roll out that can occur in certain configurations. The probability of that event occurring he thought to be “quite remote”. 
    87   Similarly to Dr Turner, he had a concern whether a screw gate karabiner could withstand the stress that it would be required to meet, if loaded across the screw mechanism. He also drew attention to the convenience aspect, the awkwardness of rotating the knurled screw behind the shoulder blades, the difficulty in testing to ensure that the screw was fully tightened, the problem of it moving with vibration, and its consequent proneness to revert to a single action hook. For those reasons, he thought karabiners to be more useful for emergency rescue activities, and sporting activities, such as ocean racing and mountaineering, than for the kind of application with which this case was concerned. 
    88   He similarly acknowledged in cross examination that in the early 1990’s there were hooks available that required forces in different directions to release the hasp. 
    89   The optimum position for the D ring he said, was between the shoulder blades of the wearer. The triangular portion of the harness onto which the container for the energy absorbing strap was stitched, he agreed, would normally lie against the wearer’s back, with the D ring between his shoulders and facing upwards. The triangle, he also agreed, would have the effect of compressing or restraining the wearer’s clothing, reducing the risk of it being caught in the hook. 
    90   So far as his experience went, he expected that a user would hook up by lifting his hand from below, as the plaintiff said that he had done, and not from above, as Dr Turner thought appropriate. The latter manoeuvre he did not think would be practical, although he accepted that ultimately it depended upon the individual to determine which way suited him. He added that he would test the connection once made, by pulling on it - in a way that he later described as “a reasonably sharp tug not sufficient to pull the (sacrificial) stitching”. 
    91   Hooking up in this fashion, and in circumstances where the wearer’s clothing was restrained, made it most unlikely, in his view, for the user to accidentally catch up a jumper on the hook. He agreed, however, that he had not conducted any practical experiment to test this view. 
    92   In cross examination by Mr Hoeben SC, he was taken back to the tug needed to test the connection:  
     
      
       
       “But you accept, do you not, that it can happen that a person could tug on the hook of the lanyard and the hook not release and yet the hook still not be properly connected?  
       
      
      
       
       A: depending on the way that the tug was applied. I suspect a lateral tug might just pull it a bit further along in the sandwich if you understand what I mean whereas a pull in the direction of the fall that would be arrested would click very clearly in such a way that you would know you were hooked on clearly.” 
       
      
    93   This was taken a little further by Mr Morris QC:  
     
      
       
       “Q. Doctor, a right handed man pulling out from the body on the lanyard, assuming it to be hooked into the webbing, may only be forcing the hasp of the hook falsely fixed more firmly into the webbing, might he not? A. He could well be, yes, yes.” 
       
      
      
     and again:  
      
      
       
       “Q. Now, I want to take the severed harness which is Exhibit D. A right handed person could easily engage the webbing? A. I would concede that, yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And tug it very firmly indeed? A. Yes, I would concede that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And not dislodge it; is that right? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Could partially engage the D and get a metallic sound from the hook and I demonstrate your Honour partly across the holding portion of the D and pull it? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Very vigorously and still not disengage it? A. And the confounding thing would be you would get that metallic -- 
       
      
      
       
       Q. The sound? A. Yes, yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You have mentioned metallic sound in your first report? A. Yes, yes. For example, if it dropped into the bottom of the bucket you would hear it if it did that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. yes, but you can make a firm affixation which would reaffirm a user that he has made a correct connection? A. Well, I would have to agree with that and I have never denied that in any way.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    94   In relation to the risks of imperfect connection, and in relation to the need for a warning or instruction his position was initially encapsulated in the following passages of evidence:  
     
      
       
       “Q. … what I am suggesting to you is that a system which involves the connection of the red hook end of the lanyard to the D ring on the harness such as been shown to you would always have the inherent danger of the connection being incorrectly made if it had to be done behind the back and you couldn’t actually see or visualise it? A. Yes, there is a remote possibility that the red hook could become sandwiched in a way and not actually on the hooked over the D ring. It could be inadvertently connected in the wrong way irrespective of any clothing. That is a remote possibility. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why do you say remote, doctor? A. Well, if you are using these things on a day to day basis and if you have been exposed to any training you would have it in your mind that it is necessary to tug at it and ensure that it is satisfactorily hooked on. It is such an easy test to undertake. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. On the assumption that you are a busy workman? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You have got your mind focused on the job. You have used the equipment before? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You propose to attach the red hook from underneath? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. As you have demonstrated. You believe you have done so. You give it a tug. It holds apparently. Would you not reasonably believe that you had made a proper connection? A. Well, it would be hinged to a large extent on just how you went about that tug. I know how I would go about the tug and how I have done it in the same situation. Its, you know, it can be a life and death situation and you really do need to make sure that the tug is correct. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But I think, as you have indicated, Doctor, familiarity does sometimes breed a little element of carelessness? A. Yes, well, there is no doubt in my mind that what you say is correct. I have had many many years of examining just those things, that we are not always dealing with a perfect world and a perfect set of conditions and this error does creep in, of course. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. So an organisation designing a harness which is intended to be used in a life and death situation such as you have described ought have it in mind, would you agree, that a person who is obliged to connect a key part of the apparatus, that is the lanyard to the harness behind his or her back where they can’t see it might make a mistake? A. I can see that a mistake could follow, but it doesn’t necessarily follow that strict instructions ought to be issued to that extent because it is such a blatantly obvious thing, to my mind anyway, but I am an engineer -- 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Would it be helpful, Doctor, do you agree, that in the instructions that went with the harness when it was supplied to the end user, to the employer, to have a requirement that either the lanyard be connected to the D ring before the harness was put on or that the connection of the D ring to the lanyard should be checked or visualised by a fellow worker? A. I have got to answer you to the effect that it would be a helpful thing, but I don’t see it in any way as being essential. It has got to be helpful, but, again, it depends on the nature of the supervision, how well it is explained. It is blatantly obvious why you need this device.” 
       
      
      
     And: 
      
      
       
        “Q. But equally Doctor, would you not agree with me that the simplest and by far the safest method would be to have a protocol or a direction that the lanyard was to be connected to the D ring before the harness was put on? A. That would, of course, reduce the risk completely. Yes, I would agree that it is a good protocol, but, again, I would say it is not essential, but it would be useful, but then you have got another practical aspect. You have got the added weight of a 1.75 metre length of, you know, wire to cart around and in some cases it would be convenient to undo that hook. You have got to sort of balance this again with the wearer acceptability. This has been my biggest problem in field work and supervising field work, to ensure the safeguards are used. They are useless if they don’t and they are passive requirements.” 
       
      
    95   He did agree that there was room on the inside of the harness for an instruction such as “affix lanyard to the D ring prior to putting on harness”. This was taken a little further in the following passage of evidence:  
     
      
       
       “…in the business of safety any instructions are advantageous, but they are not essential in every case. There must be a proper understanding of the use of this equipment. Now, that is a supervisory function as well. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Well, is it thereby suggested that when this equipment is marketed a manual should be provided with it setting out in the clearest possible terms the instructions to be delivered to those who use it before it is used? A. Well, of course, I would have to agree with you, that’s desirable, but its not necessarily essential. Its a good marketing strategy to do that.” 
       
      
    96   He also agreed that in his report of 2 February 1998, he had suggested that hooking up before donning he harness was the procedure that should be followed. In cross examination he explained this passage of his report in the following way:  
     
      
       
       “A. Well, that would be a logical preference. It’s not essential for that to happen and there are reasons of inconvenience where you have to lug the extra weight of the lanyard around that would negate that, but from a common sense point of view, yes, it’s a good alternative option.” 
       
      
    97   The risk of imperfect connection having been conceded by Dr Emerson as noted above, Mr Morris took him back to the need for an instruction in the following passages of cross examination:  
     
      
       
       “Q. Where the D can’t be visualised that’s more than just a theoretical risk, isn’t it? That is a very real risk? ?A. Yes, there is a risk, but in this document you drew my attention to, there is a requirement for training and these things ought to be known. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But also don’t you think that is a requirement for instruction? A. Oh yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You see, it could be simply placed opposite this indelible instruction on exhibit D, couldn’t it? A. Well, of course it could be, but it is not usual to do that. You -- 
       
      
      
      
       
       Q. But the critical thing to do which the harness is directed is it is saving the man’s life? A. Well, that is the whole basis of it. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And there are two pieces of metal where you could hook it? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. There (indicated) and higher on the D (indicated) and pull it so you were falsely assured you were secured? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And that might not be necessarily obvious to a user unless he was continually forewarned of it. That is fair, isn’t it? A. Yes, it would. In this principle of the tug you are really rattling the thing around to ensure that it is on the D because you have got metal to metal there, not metal to fabric. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But, look, you can get it on there (indicated) and rattle it around, can’t you? A. To a lesser extent, yes, of course. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But you see, every time the man picked up the harness whether it be from Kennards or during the course of his employment there would be a warning that it should be properly secured to the D ring and that it should be placed on the D ring when the harness is put on it? A. yes, well, I would agree with that, but these things are so obvious in the way they are - there’s no engineering tricks to this. They are simple devices. A simple hook overing is not a complex phenomena, that is, anyone would recognise the requirements to hook it on in a proper manner.” 
       
      
      
    98   As previously mentioned, Dr. Emerson regarded instruction in the use of the harness as important, both initially and with a supervisory and hook up component. He did not regard it as adequate to leave it to a co-worker to give some quick instruction as to the way in which the harness was to be donned, and the buckles adjusted. That, he said, is how accidents happen. 
    99   As to causation, it was his opinion, based upon the experiments that he had carried out in relation to the gravitational effect of the lanyard, that the possibility of the hook having been properly attached, and having then suffered roll out, as the result of pressure upon the latches, was a “very very unlikely event”, and later as an “extremely remote possibility”. He added that the “minimum probability of (the conditions required for that event) being met, in the scenario that (he) evaluated, would make it almost impossible for me to say that this (hook) could have inadvertently rolled out.” His position was perhaps best encapsulated in the following passage of evidence:  
     
      
       
       “Q. You would say that although not utterly impossible, it could only be the result of a freakish combination of circumstances? A. An extremely freakish. You have to depress the first catch at least 7 millimetres in order for the second or the hook to start to move off its position where it would afford maximum safety and that requires a pressure 180 degrees out of phase. Now, a static pressure possibly could cause an out of phase movement if pressure was applied in that direction, but it would not be a simultaneous action. It would be a consecutive action as required by the standards.” 
       
      
    100   This was taken a little further by Mr Morris QC:  
     
      
       
       “Q. And indeed I suggest to you that the hook in Exhibit F which is the red hook can be opened by pressure in a single direction? A. I wouldn’t agree with that. No, it has to be in pressure 180 degrees in opposition or out of phase. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You see, if pressure is directed against the face of both hooks, against a fixed object? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. they will open, will they not? A. Against the fixed object, but certainly not simultaneously because there is a time lag and accidents of separation of damaging in energy and time and space there is a time lag of at least the time it takes for 7 millimetres of that safety catch to be depressed before the main tongue will open. So it is not simultaneous, it is a consecutive action. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But it can be done by a non deliberate movement, can’t it? It can be done by accidental movement, can’t it? A. It could be, but to simulate that kind of situation in the scenario that we are talking about whereby this accident occurred would be most most difficult. I have tried to and I have been through it many times, like in simulated tests.” 
       
      
      
       
       …. 
        
        
       Q. And you concede I think at page 12 of your first report at about point 7 that ‘it is quite possible for the wearer to perhaps lean against something, open the first latch, the chance of opening the keeper against the natural forces of gravity would in my opinion be extremely remote’? A. it would, yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But that could occur accidentally if the hook was forced up against the side of a cherry picker bucket, couldn’t it? A. But that’s not in any way compatible with the evidence where the plaintiff is leaning forward and you have also got the effect of the gravity of a reasonably heavy metal lanyard that’s dragging the hook into the optimum safety position and for this to happen, and I mean I have got to be impartial to survive in this industry, as you know, and I mean I can turn the thing back on itself and push it against some object and probably demonstrate to you how that could all be done, but that’s not demonstrating how it could possibly have been done at the time of the injury occurrence.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
        
        
        “Q. Might the witness be shown Exhibit A. You see in tab 11 at the foot of page 1, there is a comment by Mr. Turner that: ‘It is acknowledged that some double acting hooks are susceptible to simulated roll out and that the hooks involved in this accident’, that is the red hooks here, ‘are one of the easiest to demonstrate this potential’. Do you agree with that comment? A. Well, I can’t speak for what Mr. Turner may have said in terms of what is easiest. I mean, I will accept that that double acting hooks are susceptible to roll out in some cases. That’s all I can glean from this. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Do you agree that it is easy to demonstrate it with these hooks? A. I have demonstrated it by fiddling with it myself that it can be done, but in this very unlikely circumstance it has to be in a certain configuration which I can’t, I cannot equate with the facts given to me of this accident.” 
        
       
      
    101   The circumstances of roll out of this kind occurring was left between the witness and Mr. Morris QC as something that was “possible but highly unlikely”. In his view, the “most likely scenario” was one of imperfect connection. 
    102   Reports from two further experts were tendered. They were not called as witnesses, and their reports provided little by way of additional insight into the cause of the accident, or in relation to the issues that arise. 
    103   Dr. Griffiths, a bio medical and mechanical engineer, agreed that it was possible to demonstrate an inadvertent release of the double acting hook, and also agreed that there are closed hooks available that provide more secure methods of guarding against inadvertent hook opening. However, he did not agree that inadvertent release was simple to achieve or likely to occur. He said that, assuming the lanyard was attached at one end to the bucket, and at the other end to the rear of the neck of the safety harness, gravity would have held it down and in tension. In that position he thought it “difficult to see any possible contact that the wearer ... could have had, to have caused a simultaneous release of the double-acting safety catches”. Later in his report he said ""it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate a realistic inadvertent unlatching of the safety lanyard from the upper point of the harness on a real person in a real cherry picker bucket.”  
    104   The final report of this kind came from Dr Ward of Insearch, an engineer and academic in the areas of management, and industrial safety and risk.  
    105   As to the hook, he said that it was possible to depress the safety latch by pressing the side of the hook against a surface such as the bucket wall, by a definite and deliberate action, but then the keeper latch would be in the clear and unlikely to be in a position to be also depressed, so as to allow the D-ring to slip out of the hook. Moreover, a person standing in the bucket would have the hook hanging down from the D ring and lying flat against his back, in an orientation that would make pressing the safety latch against the wall very difficult. He also thought it very difficult, due to the limited size of the bucket, for a person to bend over into a position where the safety latch could press against the bucket wall. In a later section of his report, when commenting on Dr Emerson’s report, he made it clear that he thought accidental roll out through hook compression to be “almost impossible.” This conclusion was supported by his later unsuccessful attempts to replicate accidental roll out while wearing the harness, and bending and squatting in the bucket of the Yoogali cherry picker. He also supported Dr Emerson’s opinion, contradictory of Dr Olsen’s assessment, that the latches could be operated simultaneously, since the safety latch must be depressed first, after which the keeper latch may be opened. 
    106   He observed in relation to the other aspect of causation, that “it is possible, but difficult and awkward for a person already wearing a harness to secure the hook onto the D ring; my impression is that it makes better sense for the worker to don the harness and then have another (person) snap the hook into place.” His further experiments, with the harness donned, led him to the view that while he could reach over his shoulder, pick up the D ring with one hand, while holding the latch open with the other hand, and snap the hook into place, he could not do this by reaching from below, although he recognised that a more supple person might be able to do so. 
    107   In its case, Moxham called Ian Travers the Technical Support Manager of that party. Although not strictly qualified as an expert, by reason of his absence of qualifications in engineering or ergonomics, he had considerable experience in fall protection equipment, acquired over his twenty-odd years with the company. 
    108   He said that in 1995, there were a variety of hooks and connectors on the market, including two that would achieve the objective of ensuring that a worker could not detach the lanyard from the harness. They include the tube nut connector previously mentioned, which produces a semi permanent fixture since it requires a tool to open and close it, and a hammer lock which requires a hammer and drill to punch out a locking pin. 
    109   He also said that in some circumstances a strong permanent attachment was desirable, but in other circumstances undesirable. Despite objections to this evidence, so much would appear to be common sense, since as Mr. Travers explained, some work activities with a permanently attached lanyard could be either a nuisance or dangerous, for example where there was a risk of snagging or being caught in moving machinery. 
    110   The point that Mr. Travers sought to emphasise, in relation to the various hook options available, was that their choice ultimately depended upon the purpose for which the fall arrest device was to be used, the harness being marketed to take whatever hook anybody elected to place upon it, ie subject to the components being compatible - a matter taken up in the 1983 Standard. 
    111   In cross examination he agreed that it had been known for many years that it was essential for the D ring and hook to mate, so that it would not be possible for the ring to bring pressure on the snap hook latch in a way that might release it. This was also recognised in the 1983 Standard. 
    112   He said, as is shown on the diagram attached to the harness, that the proper position for the D ring to be positioned is on the wearer’s back, between the shoulder blades. That is a position at which he thought that it could be reached by the wearer from above, but not from below. In this position, as he demonstrated, the triangle containing the energy absorber operated to restrain any clothing worn under the harness, thereby reducing the risk of the hook being caught up in it. 
    113   He endeavoured to demonstrate, in a way that was not at all apparent to me, that the wearer could visualise the connection between the D ring and hook, when the latter was lifted vertically, by turning his head. There was some possibility of this being, in the position in which the model for his demonstration was wearing the harness, if the lanyard was pulled at a fairly sharp angle to the side, but not, so it seemed to me, without a great deal of difficulty and uncertainty. 
    114   While accepting the possibility that the user might fail to effect a secure connection when the act could not be visualised, or when something was caught between the jaws of the hook, he did not believe that it would be easy to get into that situation, and added that a visual or tactile check, before applying a load, would discover it. 
    115   As to instruction, Mr Moxham explained there was a swing tag attached to the harness which it supplied and shipped in stowage bags contained in individual cartons. That tag comprised a small booklet with text on four sides. 
    116   The text of that swing tag, suggested to be of relevance in the present case included the warnings: 
     
      
       
        “Take care of it (the harness). Your life may depend on it”,  
       
      
      
      and the advice,  
      
      
       
       “the lanyard used with this harness must be secured to the D ring placed high on the harness between the shoulder blades”. 
       
      
    117   Otherwise, all that it specified in relation to the hook was: 
     
      
       
       “Always check snap hook latches. The latch on the levitator hook is robust and made of alloy steel. With harsh treatment, however, latches may distort. Before and after every use the latches on the snap hook should be checked for free movement over the full travel.” 
       
      
    118   This clearly was in the context of ongoing inspection of the snap hook before and after use. Nothing was provided by way of caution in effecting the connection. 
    119   Mr. Travers agreed that the information on the swing tag was the totality of the warning that Moxham had thought necessary to provide with the harness in 1995/1996, although he suggested that by pointing to the 1983 Australian Standard 2626, it should be understood as incorporating its provisions, even though the reference was in the context of advice as to “Care of the harness - Inspection and Maintenance”, rather than to its use. 
    120   This document did contain advice to the effect that the harness was not to be used if the risk of free fall exceeded 1.8 metres, a matter he explained that depended substantially upon the height of the fixed point to which the free end of the lanyard was attached, and also advice as to destruction of the product once a fall had been sustained using it. Otherwise, it contained instructions as to the way in which the harness was to be donned, and the way in which the body belt, leg straps and shoulder straps were to be fastened, buckled and adjusted as the case may be. It was silent as to the attachment of the lanyard, save for the advice that it should be secured to the “D ring placed high on the harness between the shoulder blades”. 
    121   Mr. Travers said that Moxham now provided, with the harness, a two-page information pamphlet in relation to harnesses, lanyards and snap hooks. It would seem from his later evidence that this pamphlet was introduced in about October 1999, and followed introduction or modification of the Australian Standard 1981.1. In relation to snap hooks, it commences by stating that it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the instructions are understood by all users, and also to ensure that training of users in the use, care and inspection of snap hooks is provided. Although these instructions are no doubt intended to relate to snap hooks provided by Moxham, the instructions given are more general and are given in the context of their use in conjunction with a safety harness. 
    122   Among other things this document warns the user not to “allow the locking hook to be nearest to your body ... the latch could be pushed against waist or leg and accidentally opened.” In a diagrammatic way it shows permitted and forbidden configurations as to the position of the hook. The purpose of such instruction, he accepted, was to avoid accidental roll out, of the kind discussed by the other witnesses, when a force in one direction was likely to activate the release mechanism. It was evident that he regarded the occasion for its occurrence as extremely rare, although apparently not so rare as to exclude it from any instruction pamphlet. 
    123   The pamphlet contains additional instructions, as follows, under a heading in capital letters: “SNAP HOOKS WARNING”: 
     
      
       
       “Do not rely on the feel or sound of a snap hook closure. Always visually check that the latches are fully engaged before applying a load”; 
       
      
      
       
       “Do not use a snap hook on equipment that will create a side loading on the latches”; 
       
      
      
       
       “Do not attach foreign objects to D rings. They may prevent the correct engagement of the hook, or give the user a false indication of the hook closure” and 
       
      
      
       
       “Do not allow the latches of the snap hook to be pushed from either side by the D ring, rope, branches, twigs, or any other obstruction in a narrow space. This could allow ‘roll out’ to occur.” 
       
      
    124   Some of the above warnings are supplemented by diagrams as to correct and incorrect procedures and are clearly directed to potential problems of imperfect closure, false indication of closure and accidental roll out through compression forces or loads applied to snap hooks. 
    125   It was Mr. Travers’ assessment, as became clear in his cross examination by Mr. Morris QC, that he thought the risk of accidental roll out, both with single acting and double acting hooks, to be extremely remote. The chances of that occurring he thought had decreased after the introduction of double action hooks. The circumstances required for its occurrence, and the possible antidote, were explained most clearly in the following passage of his evidence:  
     
      
       
       “Q. But the rollover condition or the risk of it, although it may be slight, is brought about by confining the space between the D ring and the lanyard hook by pressing up against a solid object, isn’t it? A. I assume you mean roll out?  
       
      
      
       
       Q. The roll out, yes? A. Yes, yes. To bring a double acting hook circumstance, to bring in a roll out situation, you have to apply three forces from my understanding, one to each side of the hook to engage it and they actually can’t be simultaneous. Many hooks, actually I am not sure about this one will actually lock up if you apply them simultaneously. You bring in the secondary latch and the primary latch and then there has to be an unhooking motion as well. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Some safety hooks, double acting hooks can open by a force in one direction creating an equal and opposite force on the other latch, can’t they? A. provided there is something on the other side to actually press against that’s theoretically possible, yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And there are and were in 1995 hooks available which instead of requiring force in one direction required tension in the opposite direction and pressure on one side of the hook, is that right? A. Tension in the opposite direction? 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Well, instead of force in one direction the keeper of the security had to be pulled out and then the other one pushed, if you follow me? A. I think I know what you are talking about now. If its what I think it is, yeah, I can visualise there is a hook on the market that might be interpreted like that.” 
       
      
    126   Of immediate significance for the alternative hypothesis for disengagement is the warning which the pamphlet contains concerning the use of snap hooks, mentioned above (para 123). 
    127   The information in the pamphlet Mr. Travers agreed, was proper advice. Somewhat contradictorily, however, he said that he saw no reason to agree with the proposition that this was wisdom known to Moxham in the 1990’s, or with the proposition that it was not safe for a user to assume that he was connected to an unseen D ring by feel. He thought that the connection could be checked by feel or by a jerk on the hook. This was taken further by Mr Morris QC, in the following passages of his cross examination: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Now, would you agree with me that it would be unwise to rely upon feel to determine if it were properly attached when the attachment is invisible? A. If you had no other opportunity, in other words, I would say the feel that was your very very last resort. Alternatives were getting someone to look at it connecting, taking the harness off and look at it yourself. Any one of a number of things. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And equally unwise because you can get a false hook up on the bottom of the D ring can’t you? You can get a false - ? A. Not easily. To get a false hook up there what you have go to do is push that webbing right across so it is not an easy thing to do (witness indicated) so you have gone to your main one there, if you did that, say you managed to do that, and you took a fall on that, it would obviously tear out and do a bit of damage to the hook I would imagine, but you could certainly -- 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What about partial engagement where the eye of the hook goes in between the parallel bars at the bottom of the D:? A. We wouldn’t recommend that at all. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. No, but you would get the sound of metal closure wouldn’t you? A. Not really, no. As you saw, the latch was held off there. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. No, but like that (indicated) I demonstrated the sound to you. You see your warning? A. Even then when it was held off like that when the latch was held, when the gentleman was showing it was partly in. When it would come on a load it would engage.”  
       
      
    128   Somewhat defensively and most unconvincingly, he sought to justify the absence of any earlier specific warning in these terms, upon the basis that it was “common sense that you would visually check your connection”; and/or upon the basis that it was not called for in the earlier 1983 Standard; and/or upon the basis that at least some of the hooks currently available (ie from 1999 or thereabouts) have stamped on them a caution as to the need for the wearer to make sure the latch was closed properly; and/or upon the basis that cross reference to care and use standard 2626 of 1983 might fill the gap. 
    129   He accepted that the indelible warning on the harness was intended to last for its working life, and that the aim of the instructions and picturegrams upon one of its straps, was to instruct the potential wearer, in the interests of his safety. He agreed, additionally, that there was room upon the other strap of the harness for a warning as to the need for care with the snap hook closure; and that the printing of indelible labels is not expensive in the overall cost of the harness. 
    130   He recognised the possibility that the harness could be used outside a formally supervised environment - for example by someone hiring a cherry picker from an equipment hire company. He added, however, that Moxham “would not recommend the use of the product unless it is being used by someone who is trained in (its use) with appropriate matching equipment.” He suggested that advice to that effect was supplied with the leaflets that go with the product, and that Moxham provided training, free of charge, to potential consumers. Examination of the swing tag pamphlet (Ex 14) he agreed, contained no such suggestion, compared with the later pamphlet (Ex N) which provided: 
     
      
       
       “Warning” properly trained personnel must only use this equipment”. 
       
      
      
     Any criticism in this regard, he suggested, was met by the reference within it to Standard 2626 of 1983, which he said dealt with the need for training and for care in the selection and use of the product. 
      
    131   As previously mentioned, reference to AS 2626 was made in the context of the recommendation for regular inspection of the belt and harness assembly, and the leaflet gave no indication that the purchaser or user should further access the standard in a way that might bring home the need for training or care in relation to snap hook closure. 
    132   Mr. Travers said that apart from the present case, no similar incident of harness failure and fall had been reported to him. Although he had difficulty in seeing how the plaintiff’s fall could have been due to him not making a proper connection, either because of the interruption of his clothing, or hooking the webbing, it is clear that he thought the alternative of accidental roll out through the hook striking the wall of the bucket, even more unlikely due to the combination of circumstances that are required for its occurrence. 
    133   Obviously, it was his favoured view that the plaintiff had not made any form of connection at all, particularly since he thought there would have been signs of damage to the webbing or stitching. This possibility, however, I would exclude in the light of the evidence of the plaintiff and of his brother, and in light of the improbability of the plaintiff having gone to the trouble of hooking the lanyard to the bucket, yet not to his harness. 
    134   The one point upon which all of the witnesses were agreed was that the value of the harness as a safety item was dependent upon the integrity of the connection of the lanyard to the D ring. Equally, they were agreed that there had to be a compatibility of all of the components (a matter confirmed in the 1983 Standard clause 3.3 - ie prior to the requirement for double action hooks), and that the device was only as good as the sum of all of its parts. This is an important consideration in the case of a piece of equipment that is designed to provide a last line of defence against a potentially catastrophic fall, of the kind the plaintiff suffered. 
    135   Having regard to the general thrust of the expert evidence, and of Mr. Travers’ evidence, I am of the view that accidental roll out can be excluded. That follows from my assessment that it was utterly improbable, in the work position of the plaintiff, for there to have been the combination of circumstances required for an accidental disengagement of the hook, occurring either when the plaintiff bumped the back of the bucket when he bent down, or when the bucket suddenly and unexpectedly, tipped forward. For this to occur the hook and D ring had to be so positioned for compression force on one side to generate a reciprocal force in the opposite direction sufficient to open the two latches, and for that force to be maintained for a sufficient time to allow the hook to open and slide off the D ring. Additionally, it required the D ring and hook to be so positioned that they could slide apart while the jaws of the hook remained open.  
    136   While this event could be simulated in a static position, with the hook and D ring placed or allowed to fall into the necessary configuration, as Dr Olsen showed in the witness box, yet conceded was “a most unusual configuration” (Report of 23 March 2000), the chances of this occurring in a dynamic work situation appear to me to be so remote as to be safely excluded in this case. Furthermore, the assumption that the plaintiff may have pressed the hook against the side or back of the bucket while bending or squatting to search for a tool, is at best dubious, since such a movement would be more likely to move the hook away from any such point of contact.  
    137   Both Dr. Emerson and Dr. Griffiths made this latter point with some clarity in their reports. It was made even more positively by Dr. Ward, who endeavoured, without success, to achieve the kind of contact with the bucket wall, and the orientation of the D ring and hook, that would produce roll out, by wearing the harness and squatting and bending in the bucket of the Yoogali cherry picker, in various positions including those that might have been adopted by the plaintiff when bending or squatting to search for a spanner or welder.  
    138   The extremely remote possibility of roll out occurring in the situation in which the plaintiff was working was accordingly recognised by all of the witnesses who dealt with this issue, including Mr. Travers. 
    139   Upon a balance of probabilities, and in accordance with the passage from Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd cited in Luxton v Vines (1952) 85 CLR 352 at 358, I am satisfied that the cause of the disengagement was imperfect connection of the lanyard, due either to attachment of the hook to the webbing, or to the side of the D ring, or due to interrupted closure when caught up by the plaintiff’s clothing. This is not a case of a choice between conflicting inferences of equal degree of probability capable of resolution only by conjecture. That there was an attempt at connection, and belief on the plaintiff’s part as to connection, follows from the evidence I have previously mentioned from him and from his brother. 
    140   Although there was some suggestion by the experts that the plaintiff would have heard the hook fall to the floor of the bucket if it had been imperfectly connected, this overlooks the more likely event that the ‘connection’ continued until the force of the fall pulled the hook off whatever it was to which the imperfect attachment was made. It also overlooks the problem of hearing such a noise in a working environment in which equipment is being used, and a worker is engaged in a task. 
    141   This disposes of the case so far as Fallright and SSE are concerned, since there was no suggestion of any other deficiency in the hook, that could have contributed to the failure of the fall arrest device to prevent the plaintiff’s fall. 
    142   Although a number of other kinds of hooks were shown to be available, such as a Karabiner, a screw gate swivelling hook, a hook that requires tension on one side and pressure on the other side, and that does not respond to reciprocally opposed forces, tube nut connectors and so on, clearly the choice of hook, and particularly the decision as to whether to use one that would involve a permanent or semi permanent connection, would depend upon the job for which the harness was required. In some applications, as the evidence showed, a permanent attachment would be undesirable or uncomfortable or even dangerous. In other situations, it could be advantageous. 
    143   Connecting a Karabiner or different form of snap hook behind the wearer’s back would not be any easier than the hook used in this case; and the form of hook that does not respond to reciprocal opposing forces may itself suffer from roll out if it is subjected to forces from different directions, it being accepted that no form of hook other than one that is permanently connected, can be totally immune to roll out. 
    144   No case was particularised, or pursued, against the hook manufacturers and suppliers for the absence of any relevant warning of the kind that now seems to be stamped on hooks, concerning the need to ensure or to check the integrity of the connection, a fact that emerged for the first time in the evidence of Mr. Travers. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to consider an “instruction case” against those parties, or to consider whether any such responsibility should be shared with the harness supplier, given the many potential applications of snap hooks - this being a matter of which the parties had no notice or opportunity to explore. 
    145   In all these circumstances, I am unpersuaded that the design of the hook had anything to do with the accident, or that the possible but rare condition of roll out was a causative factor in this case. 
    146   The finding I therefore make in relation to the first issue in that the harness failed to arrest the plaintiff’s fall because the hook was not properly connected to the D ring, even though the plaintiff understood that to have been the case. 
     
      
     HOOK DESIGN - LIABILITY OF FALLRIGHT AND SSE 
      
    147   I therefore find this issue in favour of Fallright and SSE. Specifically, no occasion arises for either of these parties to be found liable to the plaintiff or to the cross claimants for any reason associated with the design or supply of the hook. They are entitled to a verdict accordingly. 
     
      
     HARNESS DESIGN AND INSTRUCTIONS - LIABILITY OF MOXHAM AND KUBA 
      
    148   No complaint was made, nor could it have been, in relation to the design of the harness which all the expert witnesses regarded as complying with the relevant Australian Standard, and as suitable as a general purpose fall arrest device. Similarly, no fault was found, or complaint made in relation to the lanyard. The sole complaint pursued was in relation to the absence of any sufficient instruction as to the use of the harness and lanyard, and the absence of any sufficient warning concerning the risk of the event which I find prevented the plaintiff’s fall from being arrested. 
    149   In substance, the claim against Kuba and Moxham depended upon proof that there were relevant risks that were not identified by those defendants, and that information as to the various procedures that were available that would eliminate or avoid those risks should have been provided. 
    150   Each of the expert witnesses recognised that there was an inherent danger in effecting a connection to the harness, while it was being worn, that depended upon a hook being connected unseen to a D ring behind the wearer’s back. However done, and wherever the D ring was placed on the back of the wearer, it is extremely difficult if not impossible for the connection to be visualised. As was demonstrated in the witness box, it is possible, when making a connection, to gain the impression both by sound and by feel, that it was properly made. Moreover, the evidence established, as noted earlier, that while a firm tug on the hook, or sliding it along the D ring, could reveal an imperfect connection, that was not necessarily or inevitably so. Either way, a false positive could be generated if the wearer was to connect up behind his back, and to make either of the suggested tests, unchecked by a co-worker or supervisor. 
    151   The risk of an imperfect connection being made was in my view both real, foreseeable and neither fanciful or far-fetched. The potential consequences of it occurring were significant since the integrity of the connection was the one thing that stood between a safe arrest in the event of a fall, and death or serious injury. 
    152   As I have noted, several possibilities or safeguards for an improved or safer means of connection were explored. The suggestion advanced, at one point, of increasing the length of the extension strap to which the D ring was connected, or of allowing greater slack in the energy absorber device, was ultimately shown to be impractical, and can be dismissed. 
    153   The other possibilities examined cannot however be dismissed, either as impractical, or as other than as sensible precautions, that should have been taken and that would have prevented the failure of the harness to arrest the plaintiff’s fall. Each of them would in my view have led to that result. They were: 
     
      
     a) having someone else make the connection; 
      
      
     b) having someone else check that the connection was properly made, and/or 
      
      
     c) making the connection before the harness was donned. 
      
    154   That the risk was real was graphically demonstrated during the evidence, it being the case that there were places on the harness fairly close to the D ring, both webbing and metal, to which the hook could be inadvertently attached. Moreover, it was demonstrated that tugging on the hook could readily give a false positive. 
    155   The plaintiff said that, had an instruction been included within the indelible label, to the effect that the lanyard should be hooked onto the D ring before the harness was fitted, then he would have followed it. It may be assumed, from the evidence that he gave in relation to instructions or warnings of this kind, that had one been supplied in relation to the other two matters identified, then he would have also complied with them. 
    156   He said that he was never warned of the risk of securing the hook on the lanyard only partially to the D ring, or to the webbing, or of the integrity of the connection being affected by the hook being jammed by an article of clothing, or of the desirability of having a co-worker make the connection or check it before using the bucket.  
    157   In my view, his evidence in these respects was credible and understandable. Absent specific training, or a warning concerning the risk of imperfect connection, I am not persuaded, despite the evidence of some of the experts to the contrary, that the risks or the solutions were so obvious as not to require the provision of an appropriate instruction, ie assuming, for the moment, the existence of a duty of the kind pleaded, resting upon Moxham and Kuba, a matter to which I will next come. 
    158   While both the risks and the solution may have been obvious to the experts, either because of their concern with safety matters, or because of their familiarity with the use of such equipment in the course of their work, the same cannot be assumed of the casual user, or of the worker who is required to don and use the harness in a noisy and busy work environment, where he may be preoccupied with other activities. 
    159   As I have observed earlier, instructions concerning the way in which the harness was to be worn, and the need for care in its maintenance were provided, in a permanent form, by way of an indelible label. That it was thought necessary for users to have such advice and a permanent reminder of their terms, indicates that they were regarded as of some importance and that it was practical to supply them in this way.  
    160   Donning and buckling up the harness in the correct manner is only the first step. Equally important for a device designed to prevent the catastrophic consequences of a fall from an elevated position, is anchoring the harness by means of a lanyard to a secure point at one end, and to the worker at the other end. 
    161   Although some of the experts suggested that an instruction as to this critical step was not necessary, or was less important, for example, than other possible warnings, or that the manufacture and supplier were entitle to assume an understanding by a consumer and user as to the need for care with the connection, I am unable to agree with that view. The need for it, in view of the risk of error and of receiving a false positive and the potentially devastating consequences of an imperfect connection, was in my view compelling.  
    162   There was no practical problem or inconvenience in its provision, as is demonstrated by the current pamphlet and the caution now stamped on the hooks themselves. Moreover, as Mr. Travers conceded, the cost of an indelible instruction would not have been of any significance, and there is room for it on the harness. Equally, the cost of adding a suitable paragraph in the advice on the swing tag, or in a pamphlet, or manual or product brochure, provided with the harness, would have been insignificant. Both the provision of suitable advice in the accompanying literature and upon the harness itself would significantly add to the safety of the product, and in my view would have avoided the situation which occurred in this case. 
    163   That there was a particular need for such an instruction was in fact supported by the evidence of Mr. Travers, and of the other witnesses who spoke of the need for the training of workers who are to use such harnesses. 
    164   The question which then arises is whether, in the general circumstances outlined, and in the light of the nature and extent of the risk, and the consequences of an imperfect connection, a relevant duty attached at law to Moxham and/or to Kuba, either at general law or otherwise, to provide an instruction or warning along with the harness (Moxham) or with the complete unit (Kuba)? 
    165   In my view, Moxham owed a duty of care to an end user to supply such information and instructions in relation to the harnesses which it supplied, so as to ensure their safety in use. The existence of that duty I regard as established, not only by the element of forseeability as defined in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at pp 47 to 48, but also by the element of proximity which must be accepted as existing between a supplier and a consumer or end user of a product placed upon the market by that supplier, and by the vulnerability of a person in the position of the plaintiff, upon whose life, the effectiveness of the fall arrest device was likely to depend: Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (1999) 167 ALR 1; Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180; and Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330. 
    166   As manufacturer and supplier of the harness, I am satisfied that Moxham knew, or ought reasonably to have known, by reason of the planned location of the D ring between the wearer’s shoulders, that a user would be unable to visualise the necessary connection of the lanyard to it, and that there was a realistic risk of imperfect connection occurring, with potentially disastrous consequences if the device was called upon to arrest a fall. As such it should, in my view, conformably with the duty of care resting upon it, have drawn attention to that risk, and have provided clear instructions and warnings of it, and of the need for the wearer to hook up before donning the jacket, or otherwise to have a co-worker make or visually check the connection before placing himself in a situation, where there was a potential for a fall, and not to rely simply on the feel or sound of a snap hook closure. 
    167   Such warning and instruction, I am satisfied should have been included in the company’s product brochure. It should also have been provided to potential consumers and users in the form of an instruction pamphlet. It should additionally have been included in an indelible and permanent label on the harness itself, so as to bring the relevant matters to the attention of any worker using the product. The latter precaution was in my view important, having regard to the fact that the end user may not have been the buyer. 
    168   It was submitted that the Australian Standard provided the measure of Moxham’s duty to the plaintiff, and that since the harness generally complied with its requirements, there was no breach of that duty. This submission is not made good. 
    169   Mere compliance with a Standard, or even with common practice, does not solely or even primarily determine whether negligence exists or not: Florida Hotels v Mayo (1965) 113 CLR 588 at 593; Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479 at 487; Mercer v Commissioner for Road Transport & Tramways (1936) 56 CLR 580 at 589. Evidence as to practice, or as to the existence of a Standard remains relevant, and it may help in determining what proper care and skill requires to be done in a particular context. However, in the end it is for the Court to adjudicate upon what is the appropriate standard of care: Ainsworth v Levi NSWCA 30 August 1995 unreported; Shead v Hooley [2000] NSWCA 362; and The Council of the Shire of Muswellbrook v Lettice [2000] NSWCA 359. In the present case, I am of the view that the problem was insufficiently addressed by those responsible for the Standard, and I consider that the standard of care resting upon the parties called for specificity in the instructions as to the way in which the worker should be hooked up, and as to the possible dangers that exist in this regard. 
    170   In my assessment, the same considerations applied to Kuba in relation to the existence of a duty of care, as applied to Moxham. The elements of forseeability, proximity and vulnerability mentioned earlier had no less force or relevance for Kuba, as the party who put together the entire package, and then supplied it to the plaintiff’s employer. 
    171   It may be accepted that the mere fact of entry into a contract for the sale of goods does not necessarily establish a duty of care: Laundess v Laundess  (1994) Australian Torts Reports 81-316; Cavanagh & Phegan; Product Liability in Australia, p.510; and Fleming The Law of Torts in Australia, 9th ed. p. 457. The existence of the duty depends upon the nature of the goods sold, the risk involved and the extent to which that risk was known to, or should have reasonably been known to the supplier. In the present case, Kuba was informed of the precise application for which the equipment was needed, it knew that the harness was to be used in relation to work at heights greater than 1.8 metres above ground level, an activity that had a potential for injury through fall, and it knew or ought reasonably to have known, of the risk of the imperfect connection of the lanyard to the harness. 
    172   Moreover, Kuba was not merely an intermediate supplier which passed on a product manufactured by Moxham. It matched a lanyard and hooks to the harness, it repackaged them and it held itself out as expert in the field of safety equipment. 
    173   It is obvious that Yoogali sought its advice as to the appropriate product for that reason, and that it relied upon that advice in purchasing the two harnesses with their associated components, as effective and complete fall-arrest devices. 
    174   The reasoning in decisions such as Hadley v Droitwich Construction Co Ltd (1967) 3 All ER 911 and Anderson v Corporation of the City of Enfield (1983) 34 SASR 472 supports the existence of a duty of care on Kuba’s part. 
    175   I am similarly satisfied that Kuba should, conformably with the duty of care attaching to it, have warned, by advice in its catalogue, and by appropriate instruction, included in a pamphlet or user’s manual supplied with the product, both of the risk identified, and of the way that it could be overcome. 
    176   While it may not have been appropriate for it to tamper with the Moxham harness by adding a label of its own, it could have asked that company, as its supplier, to affix a further label, or alternatively it could have included the necessary instruction pamphlet with the product when it on sold it, along with the lanyard and hooks which were to be attached to it. The information and warning it should have provided, conformably with the duty resting upon it, was in my view, co-extensive with that expected of Moxham. 
    177   Similarly, I am satisfied that Kuba cannot rely upon compliance of the harness, and of the associated components, with the Australian Standard as negating any breach of its duty of care. 
     
      
    178   Finally, I observe in relation to the various submissions advanced by Kuba and Moxham in relation to causation, that I am satisfied had the necessary warning and instructions been supplied when the harness was sold, and indelibly inscribed on the harness, that the plaintiff would have followed them. His evidence in that regard I accept. I am not persuaded that written instructions would have been ignored had they been supplied to Yoogali, particularly in view of the fact that it, and the plaintiff, had been recently prosecuted. Causation in the sense explained in Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 has been established. 
    179   In those circumstances, I find that negligence has been established against each of Moxham and Kuba, and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, in the agreed uncapped sum of $6.2m against each of those parties. 
     
      
     RECOVERY UNDER THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
      
    180   This issue relates potentially only to Moxham, the plaintiff’s claim against Kuba being one based solely upon negligence. 
    181   The relevant provision upon which reliance was placed is S 75AD, of the Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “75AD If 
       
      
      
       
       a) a corporation in trade or commerce, supplies goods manufactured by it; and 
       
      
      
       
       b) they have a defect; and 
       
      
      
       
       c) because of the defect, an individual suffers injuries; 
       
      
      
       
       then: 
       
      
      
       
       d) the corporation is liable to compensate the individual for the amount of the individual’s loss suffered as a result of the injuries; and 
       
      
      
       
       e) the individual may recover that amount by action against the corporation; and 
        
       
      
      
       
       f) … “ 
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    182   For a plaintiff to succeed upon a claim based under this section, he must first show that the goods had a “defect”, as defined in S 75AC of the act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
       “75AC(1) [interpretation] For the purposes of this Part, goods have a defect if their safety is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect. 
       
      
      
       
       75AC(2) [Relevant circumstances] In determining the extent of the safety of goods regard is to be given to all relevant circumstances including: 
       
      
      
       
       a) the manner in which and the purposes for which they have been marketed; and 
       
      
      
       
       b) their packaging; and 
       
      
      
       
       c) the use of any mark in relation to them; and 
       
      
      
       
       d) any instructions for, or warnings with respect to, doing or refraining from doing, anything with or in relation to them; 
       
      
      
       
       e) what might reasonably be expected to be done with or in relation to them; and 
       
      
      
       
       f) the time when they were supplied by their manufacturer.” 
       
      
    183   A claim brought under S 75AD is however excluded in the circumstances specified in S 75AI of the Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “75AI Section 75AD, … does not apply to a loss in respect of which an amount has been, or could be, recovered under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that: 
       
      
      
       
       a) relates to workers’ compensation; or 
       
      
      
       
       b) …” 
       
      
    184   Part VA of the Act, within which these provisions are included, was introduced by Act No 106 of 1992. The Explanatory memorandum for the Bill, pursuant to which it was introduced, provided: 
     
      
       
       “40. The new Part VA is being introduced as a consumer protection measure. Loss caused by work-related injuries has therefore been excluded, as it is considered that this field is comprehensively regulated under existing worker’s compensation regimes. Similarly, loss which is regulated by way of international agreement has also been excluded.” 
       
      
    185   It is here the case the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by a work related injury. It is also the fact that the plaintiff has already recovered some amounts under a law of a State which relates to worker’s compensation, from Yoogali or its insurers. 
    186   The question which arises is whether S 75A1 operates, where the plaintiff is entitled to independent recovery from his employer under a law relating to worker’s compensation, to bar all recovery under S 75AD; or operates to limit recovery to such sums of money that would otherwise be recoverable beyond any cap arising under the relevant workers compensation legislation; or operates to limit recovery in relation to those heads of loss for which recovery is not possible under the relevant workers compensation legislation. 
    187   The section is ambiguous, and it is accordingly appropriate to have regard to the explanatory memorandum, a reading of which inclines me to the view that a person in the position of the plaintiff, who has the protection of workers compensation legislation, cannot also bring a claim under the Trade Practice Act against a corporation where goods manufactured and supplied by it have a relevant defect, that leads to an injury to the plaintiff in the course of his work. 
    188   It was argued, however, by the plaintiff, that the present was not a case in which a loss “could be recovered” under workers compensation legislation, because of the operation of S 151E of the Workers Compensation Act which required the plaintiff to seek recovery under the Motor Accidents Act. However, recovery under that Act is confined to recovery for fault, whereas the plaintiff was also entitled to receive benefits, without proof of fault under the Workers Compensation Act, and has in fact received such benefits. 
    189   In my view, that is an answer to the plaintiff’s submission. It follows that the S 75AD claim against Moxham must fail. 
     
      
     CLAIMS FOR CONTRIBUTION OR INDEMNITY 
      
    190   The final determination of the cross claims was stood over for separate consideration, once the issues of primary liability were determined, in particular to allow the parties to consider if necessary the various amendments that were made during the proceedings, or shortly before the matter came on for hearing, raising additional claims in contract. Having regard to the findings which I have made in relation to the absence of liability so far as Fallright and SSE are concerned, the need for any further determination of those questions now appears to be academic. 
    191   So far as I can see, there is, accordingly, no impediment in the way of dealing with the remaining cross claims of Yoogali, Moxham and Kuba, at least so far as they arise under S5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946.  
    192   Upon that basis, although subject to further consideration, if I am incorrect in that assumption, I shall proceed to announce my findings in relation to those cross claims. 
    193   The relevant principles in this regard are well known, and do not require restatement other than to note that they are as laid down by the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492. In essence, consideration needs to be given to the relative culpability of each defendant, and to the causal potency of their negligence. 
    194   In dealing with this issue it is fundamental to note that the primary cause of the plaintiff’s fall was the failure of the cherry picker, an event for which Yoogali alone was responsible. The responsibility of Kuba and Moxham for the failure of the safety equipment to arrest that fall was only a secondary cause of his injuries. Without the failure of the cherry picker, there would have been no fall and no injury to the plaintiff. 
    195   It must follow, in my view, that the primary and most significant cause of the plaintiff’s accident and consequent injuries, was the negligence of Yoogali in connection with the absence of proper maintenance of the cherry picker, and not providing safe equipment or a safe place of work. The responsibility of Kuba and Moham was secondary to that of Yoogali.  
    196   I do not, however, consider Yoogali to have been in any better position than the plaintiff was, in having an appreciation of the relevant risks or the need for safeguards in the use of the fall arrest device. 
    197   It had no particular expertise in relation to the wearing or use of safety harnesses, and in the circumstances outlined above, it had received no indication as to any particular need for training its staff in relation to the kind of problem which emerged on this occasion, let alone any caution as to the risks of imperfect attachment, and of the available safeguards or procedures to be followed to avoid such matters, nor had it been invited by Kuba to have its workers trained in the use of the harness and associated equipment which that party supplied to it. Had the position in these respects been otherwise and had Yoogali then ignored those matters, its culpability and the causal potency of its negligence, would have been substantially increased, both by reason of the absence of training and of supervision. 
    198   So far as Moxham and Kuba are concerned, I find their responsibility to be equivalent since each claimed expertise, each was involved in the supply of the equipment, and each had an opportunity and occasion to provide proper instruction and advice in relation to the use of the product, in the form either of an indelible marking (in the case of Moxham) or a pamphlet or instructional manual (in the case of Kuba). 
    199   Taking these matters into account, I assess the relative percentage responsibilities for the purposes of the Act, as follows: 
     
      
     Yoogali 70% 
      
      
     Moxham 15% 
      
      
     Kuba 15% 
      
      
     MOTOR ACCIDENTS ACT CAP IN RELATION TO CROSS CLAIMS AGAINST YOOGALI 
      
    200   Subject to any need for further consideration of the cross claims I turn, finally, to deal with the issue of law that concerns the way in which an apportionment is to be worked out in a case where the liability of Yoogali is capped by Statute at $5m, yet that of the other defendants is uncapped. 
    201   Yoogali’s liability arises under Part 6 of the Motor Accident Act 1988. Had the plaintiff’s accident not been a motor accident within the meaning of that Act, then his damages would have been awarded under the Workers Compensation Act 1987. 
    202   Section 151E(2) of that Act provides that Division 3 of Part 5 does not apply to an award of damages to which Part 6 of the Motor Accidents Act applies. That Division does not however include S 151Z, which is found in Division 5 of Part 5 of the Act. 
    203   Section 151Z(2) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “(2) If, in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act: 
       
      
      
       
       a) the worker takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from a person other than the worker’s employer; and 
       
      
      
       
       b) the worker also takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from that employer, 
       
      
      
       
       the following provisions have effect: 
       
      
      
       
       c) the damages that may be recovered from the person by the worker in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a) are to be reduced by the amount by which the contribution which the person would (but for this part) be entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise exceeds the amount of the contribution recoverable; 
       
      
      
       
       d) the amount of the contribution that the person is entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise is to be determined as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with provisions of Division 3 as to the award of damages”. 
       
      
    204   The question which then arises is whether, notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff’s damages were awarded under the Motor Accidents Act, S 151Z (2) of the Workers Compensation Act still has work to do. Although the matter is not free from doubt, it is my view that, not having been specifically excluded by S 151E(2), it does apply to the present case. Assuming that to be correct, it would require the percentage of the employer’s share for the responsibility for the injury to be applied, not to the full amount of the damages against the third party ($6.2m) but to the damages assessed in accordance with the formula provided under the Motor Accidents Act ($5m). 
    205   This accords with the purpose of S 151Z(d) identified in Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (1994) 35 NSWLR 82, which was one of preventing a worker from recovering more directly from his or her employer, than could have been recovered had the employer alone been responsible, yet without increasing the net burden on the other tortfeasors. 
    206   It follows, in my view, that any apportionment calculation should be based on the uncapped liability of the non Yoogali defendants ($6.2m) with Yoogali’s maximum exposure to all parties being limited to its capped liability ($5m). The decisions in Unsworth v Commissioner of Railways (1958) 101 CLR 73; and Commonwealth of Australia v Flaviano (1996) 40 NSWLR 199 at 201 and 202, tend to support this conclusion so far as they decide that contribution cannot be recovered against a tortfeasor with a limited liability for damages to a plaintiff, in excess of that which the tortfeasor is liable to pay to the plaintiff. 
     
      
     CONCLUSION 
      
    207   The plaintiff is accordingly entitled to a verdict and judgment against Yoogali for $5m, and against Kuba and Moxham for $6.2m. I will reserve the making of final orders in respect of the plaintiff’s claims against Kuba and Moxham, and in respect of the cross claims, in case the parties wish to pursue further submissions in that regard. All questions of costs, including those of SSE and Fallright, will be similarly reserved. 
    208   I publish these reasons for the consideration of the parties. The proceedings will be relisted for further hearing in relation to any reserved issues upon a date to be fixed.

       Wednesday 19 September 2001 
        
        
        REGINA v KCH 
        
        
       Facts: 
        
       The appellant stood trial in the District Court on one count of sexual intercourse with S, a child under ten years and on an alternative count of aggravated indecent assault on the same child. After the first day of the trial and prior to the conclusion of the Crown case, the appellant changed his plea to the alternative count from not guilty to guilty, this was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of the indictment. The appellant was sentenced to 6 ½ years imprisonment for the alternative charge, he appeals against the conviction and sentence.  
        
        
       The appeal against conviction arises on the ground that acceptance of the guilty plea amounted a miscarriage of justice. It was alleged by the appellant that he received inappropriate advice from his legal representatives in relation to his guilty plea and that the decision to change his plea was influenced by improper pressure. The appellant asserted that he was told by his legal representatives that the trial judge had expressed the view that it was possible that he would be convicted on the more serious charge and that he would probably be convicted on the alternative charge and hence should plead guilty to the alternative charge. It was these alleged comments by the trial judge that were said to constitute improper pressure.  
        
        
       The appeal against sentence arises on three grounds, Firstly, that the trial judge erred in sentencing the appellant on the basis that the charge on which he was convicted was a representative count. Secondly, it was argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Thirdly, leave was granted to argue that the sentence miscarried due to the failure of counsel to obtain instructions as to the factual basis of the guilty plea.  
        
        
       HELD 
        
       Appeal against conviction upheld by majority.  
        
       Appeal against sentence, while not necessary to decide, upheld.  
        
       
      (1) Per Ipp AJA, Hulme J and Sperling J agreeing 
      
       
       Counsel for the appellant, in advising him that there was a serious danger of him being convicted on the main charge and a strong probability of his conviction on the alternative charge, was giving sensible and proper advice. There was no imprudent or inappropriate advice, nor is there substance in any criticism of the conduct of his defence. This ground of appeal therefore fails.

       (i) Improper pressure as the basis for overturning the guilty plea 
        
         
         While an appellate court will approach the withdrawal of a guilty plea with circumspection, an appellant will be permitted to withdraw a plea of guilty where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. The court will overturn a guilty plea on the basis of improper pressure if the plea is entered in circumstances where the accused, due to pressure or threats, does not make a free choice in deciding to plea.

      (ii) Relevance of the strengths and weaknesses of the respective cases 
      
       
        
         
         In most cases involving the withdrawal of a guilty plea the relative strengths and weaknesses of the cases will be relevant. However, a guilty plea brought about by incorrect advice of a judge’s views is a fundamental irregularity in the trial process, which, of itself, is a substantial miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances any questions about the appellant’s guilt are irrelevant.

      (3) Per Ipp AJA, Sperling J agreeing 
      
       
       While there were a number of opposing versions as to what the appellant was told about the judge’s views the evidence did not establish on the balance of probabilities that the appellant was told of the judge’s view before he decided to plead guilty. It is, however, clear that the appellant did become aware of the judge’s supposed views when written instructions as to the change of plea were read to the appellant. Upon becoming aware of the judge’s supposed views the appellant was influenced in maintaining his guilty plea and as a consequence the plea was procured by improper pressure and a miscarriage of justice occurred.  
       
       (4) Per Ipp AJA, Sperling J agreeing 
      
       
       Legal practitioners owe a duty to the court not to bring improper pressure on clients to plead guilty, this will be breached where a practitioner deliberately or negligently gives a client false information as to the trial judges’ view or opinion. This duty is part of the general duty not to corrupt the administration of justice which is derived from the public interest in ensuring the administration of justice is not subverted.  
        
        
       (5) Per Ipp AJA, Hulme J and Sperling J agreeing 
        
       As to the sentence appeal, while not strictly necessary, the sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive but the sentencing exercise miscarried by reason of counsel’s failure to obtain the appellant’s instructions as to the factual basis of the guilty plea.  
        
       
      (6) Per Hulme J in dissent 
      
       
        
         
         The Appellant’s decision to plead guilty occurred prior to his counsel seeing the trial judge and was an exercise of free choice. While the alleged comments by the trial judge were calculated to influence a person who was undecided or having second thoughts, the Appellant was not in that position. The alleged comments did not in fact operate as any inducement, which led to the appellant pleading guilty, that decision had already been freely made.  
         
        
       
       
      (7) Per Hulme J in dissent 
      
       
        
         
         No miscarriage of justice arises on the basis of the communication to the Appellant of the views expressed, or purportedly expressed, by the trial judge. Such representations by judicial officers should not be treated any differently to other representations and a miscarriage will only arise in circumstances improper pressure or a lack of free choice can be properly inferred.

        REGINA v KCH 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
     1    IPP AJA:  
      
       
        
       The guilty plea and the arguments on appeal in relation to conviction and sentence 
        
       
     2    On 2 June 1999 the appellant stood trial in the District Court in Bathurst on one count of sexual intercourse with S, a child under the age of ten years, and on an alternative count of aggravated indecent assault involving the same child. On 3 June 1999, prior to the conclusion of the Crown case, the appellant changed his plea to the alternative count from not guilty to guilty. The Crown accepted his plea and the appellant was duly convicted on the alternative count. A sentence of 6½ years imprisonment was imposed. The appellant now appeals against the conviction and sentence.  
      
       
     3    The appellant appeals against the conviction on the ground that his plea of guilty was entered in circumstances giving rise to a miscarriage of justice under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The appellant seeks orders that the conviction be set aside and he be given leave to withdraw his plea of guilty.  
      
       
     4    In written submissions filed on the appellant’s behalf it was contended that the appellant was inappropriately advised by his legal representatives in relation to his guilty plea and, further, the conduct of the appellant’s case at trial was incompetent. It was said that the appellant was wrongly advised that he was in serious jeopardy of being convicted of the more serious offence and he was not adequately advised that his plea of guilty constituted an acceptance of guilt on his part. Further, it was submitted that the incompetent conduct of the defence contributed to his perception of the difficulties with his case which led to his decision to plead guilty.  
      
       
     5    During the course of oral argument it was further submitted on the appellant’s behalf that his legal representatives had put improper pressure on him to plead guilty and he had been influenced by that improper pressure to plead guilty. According to the appellant, the improper pressure resulted from certain advice he was given by his counsel, Mr Ian Byrne, and his solicitor, Mr Grahame Billing, as to what the trial judge, Karpin DCJ, had allegedly told Mr Byrne in the course of a discussion between her Honour, Mr Byrne and the Crown prosecutor, Mr Lerve.  
      
       
     6    Although his evidence was not always constant on this issue, the appellant asserted that he was told by Mr Byrne and Mr Billing that Karpin DCJ had said to Mr Byrne in effect that it was possible that he would be convicted on the first and more serious charge and would certainly (or probably) be convicted on the alternative charge; hence, they said, he should plead guilty to the alternative charge. This advice, the appellant asserted, constituted improper pressure and caused him to plead guilty.  
      
       
     7    Initially, the appellant appealed against sentence on two grounds. Firstly, he contended that Karpin DCJ erred in sentencing him on the basis that the count on which he was convicted was a representative count. Secondly, he contended that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Later, in the course of argument, the appellant was given leave to add a ground to the effect that the sentence miscarried by reason of the failure of his counsel to obtain his instructions with respect to the factual basis of the guilty plea and to put his case fully in regard to sentence.  
      
       
     8    Affidavits were filed by Mr Byrne, Mr Billing, Mr Lerve (counsel who represented the Crown at the trial) and Mr Kotarski (a friend of the appellant) dealing with the advice Mr Byrne and Mr Billing allegedly gave to the appellant concerning the judge’s views. Additionally, leave was given for the appellant, Mr Byrne, Mr Billing and Mr Kotarski to give oral evidence before this Court on the issues so raised. They were called to testify and were cross-examined.  
      
       
     9    I would emphasise at the outset that no witness testified that Karpin DCJ said the words allegedly attributed to her. On the contrary, the testimony of Mr Lerve and Mr Byrne is that, prior to the appellant’s plea of guilty being entered to the alternative charge, her Honour did not comment at all on the possibility of the appellant being found guilty on either charge. Accordingly, the appeal must be dealt with on the basis that her Honour did not say that which, according to the appellant, Mr Billing and Mr Byrne told him she had said.  
      
       
        
       The evidence at the trial  
        
       
     10    The principal witness against the appellant at the trial was the complainant, the appellant’s step-daughter, then a seven year old child. The complainant lived in the same house as her mother, the appellant and her younger sister. In her bedroom there was a bunk bed. The complainant slept on the top bunk and her sister slept below.  
      
       
     11    The complainant testified that on the night of 17 April 1998 the appellant came into her room, climbed onto the top bunk, pulled down the sheet cover, pulled down his and the complainant’s pants, and put his penis into her vagina. This hurt the complainant and she screamed. She told the appellant to stop. He eventually did so and fell asleep beside the child. The complainant said that after the assault upon her she felt “sticky stuff” around her vagina. Later her mother came into the room. The appellant was asleep still naked from the waist down. The complainant’s mother hit the appellant on his naked bottom and ordered him back to their bed. The appellant pulled up his pants and left the room arguing with the mother.  
      
       
     12    According to the complainant, she then went into the lounge room and told her mother what had happened. The next day the complainant saw her aunt, Mrs Worthington, and told her about the things the appellant had done. Mrs Worthington communicated with the police and this led to the complainant speaking to a police officer.  
      
       
     13    In cross-examination the complainant in effect testified that she had been anally penetrated and the appellant had not penetrated her vagina. The evidence revealed that when speaking of what had occurred to Mrs Worthington, the police and Mr Goodwin, a family friend, the complainant had asserted that she had been anally penetrated. 
      
       
     14    Medical evidence was led to the effect that no abnormality of the perianal region was detected. The tissue closing off the vaginal orifice appeared normal and intact. According to the medical evidence some anal dilation and tearing caused by an insertion of an erect penis into the anus could be expected, but this would depend upon the extent of penetration. There might not be physical damage if penetration had occurred on a regular basis. 
      
       
     15    In her testimony, the complainant’s mother initially asserted that the complainant had told her that the appellant had done nothing to her. The Crown was then given leave to cross-examine the mother. It transpired that she had made a statement to the police in which she said that she had seen the appellant lying next to the complainant in the bunk bed with his track suit pants down and around his knees. According to the statement, when she asked the complainant whether the appellant had done anything to her, the complainant said, “Yeah, he pushed against me”. Also according to the statement, the complainant told her mother that on the evening in question: 
      
       
        
         
         “Daddy got something hard and greasy and pushed against me hard and then I got all wet”. 
         
        
        
       In the statement the mother said that the appellant was naked on the complainant’s bed and the mother yelled at him to get out of the room. Later she saw an ejaculation mark on the complainant’s sheets.  
        
       
     16    Mrs Worthington testified that the complainant told her that the appellant had come into the room, pulled his pants and her pants down, and “put his private parts into where she does a poo and with that she pointed with her finger around to her bottom”.  
      
       
     17    Mr Goodwin testified that he had spoken to the complainant who told him that the appellant had done a “naughty thing” to her. In cross-examination, Mr Goodwin said that he had asked the complainant why she had told him what she had said at her aunt’s house. The complainant replied then that she said those things because she was scared and the appellant “didn’t do it”, and he “didn’t stick his thing in me”. At a later stage, however, she told Mr Goodwin that the appellant “did try and do things to me”. Towards the end of the cross-examination, a statement Mr Goodwin had signed was put to him in an attempt to refute the testimony he had given. It was then revealed that he could not read and the appellant had written the statement and given it to him to sign. At this stage the lunch adjournment was taken. By about 2.45 pm, when the trial resumed, the appellant had decided to plead guilty.  
      
       
     18    It is to be noted that, at the time of the appellant’s plea, the Crown, to the appellant’s knowledge, had available to it forensic evidence that there were semen stains on the bedclothes that were on the complainant’s bed on the night in question. But for the appellant’s plea, this evidence would have been led.  
      
       
        
       The strength of the Crown case 
        
       
     19    On the main charge of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, the critical question for the jury was whether they believed her testimony beyond reasonable doubt in preference to that of the appellant. The main point in the appellant’s favour was the complainant’s uncertainty as to whether the penetration had been anal or vaginal. In this regard, Karpin DCJ, in the course of her sentencing remarks, said that the complainant “was a very persuasive witness”. 
      
       
     20    Mr Byrne testified that the evidence of the complainant’s mother was “just dreadful in terms of [the appellant’s] case”. He was supported in this by the finding of Karpin DCJ who regarded the written statement made by the complainant’s mother as true and considered it to be highly corroborative of the complainant’s evidence. Mr Byrne said that the evidence of Mrs Worthington, who testified next, was “forceful, very much to the point” but worse was to come for the appellant when, late on the morning of 4 June 1999, Mr Goodwin produced a statement contrary to the Crown’s case and it emerged that he could not read and the appellant had written out the statement. By then, according to Mr Byrne, it was obvious that the case was “going … badly”. The transcript of the evidence bears out Mr Byrne’s testimony in this respect. 
      
       
     21    Additionally, Mr Byrne had misgivings as to the reliability of the appellant as a witness. The appellant had given Mr Byrne differing sets of instructions on relevant issues and on 3 June 1999, when the court adjourned before lunch, no decision had been made as to whether he should be called to testify.  
      
       
     22    On the alternative charge, the Crown case was very strong indeed. The evidence was that the appellant had been lying next to the complainant in the narrow bunk bed, naked from the waist down. There were semen stains on the bedclothes. The appellant did not dispute any of these matters. His explanation for the semen stains was that they were caused by sexual intercourse he had had with his wife some 15 to 20 minutes before coming to lie next to the complainant. In addition, the appellant had told Mr Byrne that he could understand the complainant’s statement that she had felt his penis pushing against her. This led Mr Byrne to believe that the appellant conceded that his penis had been erect at the time.  
      
       
        
       The arguments based on inappropriate advice and negligent conduct of the defence 
        
       
     23    Prior to the hearing of the appeal, when written submissions were filed, the arguments based on allegedly inappropriate advice and negligent conduct of the defence formed the main plank of the appellant’s appeal against conviction. Later, the appellant’s argument focused on the argument that the plea had been entered as a result of improper pressure, and no further submissions were made in regard to the first-mentioned grounds. Given the relative strengths of the respective arguments that is readily comprehensible. I shall, nevertheless, deal briefly with the arguments made in the written submissions concerning inappropriate advice and negligence in the conduct of the defence.  
      
       
     24    The imprudent or inappropriate advice was said to be that the appellant was in serious jeopardy of being convicted of the more serious offence in circumstances where there were fundamental difficulties with that count. Mr Game SC, senior counsel for the appellant, pointed out that the Crown had opened to the jury in relation to the first count on the basis that the complainant’s vagina had been penetrated. As the Crown conceded at the trial, however, there was uncertainty and doubt as to whether the complainant was alleging vaginal or anal penetration.  
      
       
     25    Karpin DCJ, in her remarks on sentence, observed that there was a strong inference that the “penetration of which the complainant spoke was more likely attempted anal penetration”. 
      
       
     26    The indictment alleged merely that on or about 17 April 1998 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, she then being under the age of ten years, namely six years. Whether the uncertainty as to whether there had been vaginal penetration or anal penetration would have inevitably resulted in a verdict of acquittal on the first count is open to question. In her remarks on sentence, Karpin DCJ expressed the opinion that the appellant “stood in real jeopardy of being found guilty by the jury on the primary count in the indictment”. I have referred to the factors that supported the Crown case. These would have led any competent counsel to conclude that there was a real prospect of the appellant being found guilty of the main count.  
      
       
     27    In my view, in advising the appellant that he was in jeopardy of being found guilty of the main charge and that there was a strong probability of him being found guilty of the alternative charge, Mr Byrne was fulfilling his duty to his client and giving him sensible and proper advice. 
      
       
     28    The appellant’s written argument further criticised the way in which the complainant was cross-examined. It was submitted: 
      
       
        
         
         “there was no real testing of the complainant’s account and, further, it was not suggested that her evidence was untrue. In addition, it does not appear that the appellant’s version of events was ever put to the complainant”. 
         
        
        
       These criticisms have to be seen in the context of the difficulties that Mr Byrne faced at the trial in cross-examining the seven year old complainant. On the one hand, Mr Byrne had been given varying instructions as to the facts. On the other, the complainant, at least according to the assessment of Karpin DCJ, “was a very persuasive witness”. On my examination of the transcript it seems to me that counsel cross-examined the complainant with care and sensitivity. In my opinion the submissions that the cross-examination was conducted incompetently are unfounded.  
        
       
     29    Generally, I consider that there is no substance in the criticisms made of the way in which Mr Byrne conducted the appellant’s defence.  
      
       
     30    Accordingly, I would not uphold the arguments advanced on the appellant’s behalf directed to these matters.  
      
       
        
       Improper pressure as the basis of overturning the guilty plea: the legal principles  
        
       
     31    The starting point in the inquiry is to acknowledge the circumspection or restraint with which an appellate court is required to approach an appeal grounded on the proposition that a plea of guilty which led to the conviction should be withdrawn. As Kirby P observed in Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 122: 
      
       
        
         
         “This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
         O’Neill  
         [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59;  
         Sagiv 
          (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81”. 
         
        
        
       See also  
       Boag 
        (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 and 
        R v Wilkes 
        [2001] NSWCCA 97.  
       
     32    An appellant will nevertheless be permitted to withdraw a plea of guilty where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. There is no closed catalogue of circumstances that are capable of giving rise to such a miscarriage of justice and each case depends on its own circumstances. 
      
       
     33    A valid plea of guilty is one that is entered in the exercise of a free choice: Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 141 per Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ. The plea must be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt: Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511. 
      
       
     34    There have been several expressions of the requirements which have to be met before a court will allow a guilty plea brought about by imprudent and inappropriate advice given by the convicted person’s legal representatives to be withdrawn. In R v Wilkes Wood CJ at CL with whom Giles JA and Simpson J agreed said that an argument of this kind would hinge upon three considerations: 
      
       
        
         
         “(a) whether the advice given to the appellant was or was not imprudent and inappropriate; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) whether his plea was or was not attributable to a consciousness of guilt; and 
         
        
        
         
         (c) whether the material before this Court shows that there is or is not a real question about his guilt”.

     35    The advice concerning the judge’s views (that was allegedly given to the appellant in the present case) was of a different character to that considered in the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph. It is one thing to give careless and wrong advice about an accused person’s prospects of success in the trial. It is another to advise that person, incorrectly, that the judge is of the opinion that he may be found guilty on the more serious charge and is likely to be found guilty on the lesser charge.  
      
       
     36    The effect of advice as to the prospects of a defendant being found guilty, given by a person cloaked with the full power of judicial office, who is presumed to have deep knowledge and understanding of the law and to be entirely neutral, is incalculable. For an accused person, whose liberty is in immediate jeopardy, advice from such a source would carry immeasurable weight and would be very difficult to resist. The ordinary consequence will be that such advice will be regarded as having overborne the free will of the defendant and the integrity of the plea of guilty will be regarded as irretrievably tainted. 
      
       
     37    In my opinion, a guilty plea so brought about is an irregularity or flaw in the conduct of the trial so fundamental that it goes to the root of the proceedings and, of itself, will amount to a substantial miscarriage of justice. In such a case the appellate court is not required to determine if a conviction would have been inevitable and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases become irrelevant: Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 373. See in this regard R v Turner [1970] 2 QB 321 where a similar situation arose and Lord Parker CJ in giving the judgment of the court said at 326: 
      
       
        
         
         “[Although the appellant] was warned that the choice was his, once he felt that this was an intimation emanating from the judge, it is really idle in the opinion of this court to think that he really had a free choice in the matter”. 
         
        
       
     38    Accordingly, cases such as R v Wilkes are distinguishable and are not presently of application. In my opinion, if it is found that the decision to plead guilty was materially influenced by incorrect advice that the judge had expressed views of the kind alleged in this case, improper pressure is established and a finding of a miscarriage of justice must inevitably be made. 
      
       
     39    A different conclusion appears to have been reached in The Queen v Pinhassovitch (unreported, Supreme Court of Victoria, CCA 7 February 1994), although the facts of the case may be distinguishable. With respect, however, if Pinhassovitch is to be regarded as being on all fours with the present case, I would not follow it.  
      
       
     40    I should also mention R v Boyd [2000] NSWCCA 110. In this case the trial judge was asked by the Crown Prosecutor in open court but in the absence of the jury what course he would adopt in regard to sentencing the accused. The judge said that if the accused had prior convictions, were he to be convicted he would “certainly go to gaol on a full time basis”. His Honour went on to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “If there is a plea forthwith, I would consider a penalty short of a full-time custodial sentence”. 
         
        
        
       The appellant contended that this observation constituted undue pressure and he was thereby deprived of the requisite freedom of choice.  
        
       
     41    Powell JA (with whom Hulme and Dowd JJ agreed) described the trial judge’s observation as “unfortunate” but did not regard the statement in the particular circumstances as being undue pressure. Hulme J agreed with Powell JA and remarked that even if he were persuaded that the appellant’s plea of guilty was entered otherwise than through a consciousness of guilt, it did not follow that the appeal should be allowed and the appellant permitted to withdraw his plea. Six years had elapsed since the appellant’s plea and as his Honour put it “the reason for the delay will have been the actions of the appellant consciously engaged in for the benefits he saw himself likely to derive from the course he adopted”.  
      
       
     42    In my opinion, R v Boyd is to be distinguished from the present case. There is a significant difference between an accused person being told that the judge, at the parties’ request, had expressed an opinion as to the prospects of a gaol sentence should the appellant be convicted, and an accused person being told that the judge had advised that he might be found guilty on one charge and would probably be found guilty on another.  
      
       
     43    In any event, it seems to me, the ruling authority on the issue is Meissner v The Queen and to the extent that other authorities are inconsistent therewith they are not to be followed. In that case Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ at 142 approved the following principle stated by Lawton LJ in R v Inns (1974) 60 Cr App R 231 at 233: 
      
       
        
         
         “The whole basis of a plea on arraignment is that in open court an accused freely says what he is going to do; and the court attaches so much importance to a plea of guilty in open court that no further proof is required of the accused’s guilt. When the accused is making a plea of guilty under pressure and threats, he does not make a free plea …” 
         
        
       
     44    Their Honours went on at 142 to say: 
      
       
        
         
         “If a plea of guilty is entered by the person charged in purported exercise of a free choice to serve that person’s own interests, but the plea is in fact procured by pressure and threats, there is a miscarriage of justice.” 
         
        
        
       See also Dawson J at 157.  
        
       
     45    The essential question that falls to be decided, therefore, is whether the appellant was informed, as he alleged, that Karpin DCJ had expressed an opinion to Mr Byrne as to his prospects of being found guilty of the offences of which he was charged. 
      
       
        
       Advice to the appellant that the trial is not going well: he considers his position  
        
       
     46    At about 11.30 am on 3 June 1999 there was a short adjournment of the criminal trial during which Mr Byrne informed the appellant that in his opinion the trial was going very badly. The appellant agreed that this was so. Mr Byrne then informed the appellant that the Crown had offered a plea to the lesser charge.  
      
       
     47    At the luncheon adjournment Mr Byrne informed the appellant that the evidence since morning tea had led to the appellant’s position becoming worse, and the appellant did not disagree with that view. Mr Byrne told the appellant that in his view the Crown had established all that was necessary for the appellant to be convicted of indecent assault.  
      
       
     48    Mr Billing also told the appellant that the trial was not going well and he should carefully consider his position. The appellant told his lawyers that he would speak with his family during lunch about pleading guilty and he would let them know his decision when he returned to court. 
      
       
     49    At that stage, the appellant was reluctant to plead guilty.  
      
       
        
       The opposing versions as to what the appellant was told about the judge’s views  
        
       
     50    The crucial area of dispute is what happened after lunch and the stage at which the appellant was told of the judge’s views. It has been difficult to make firm factual findings on these matters. One of the problems is that witnesses were not cross-examined on some significant issues and Mr Lerve was not cross-examined at all.  
      
       
     51    There were two opposing versions as to the circumstances in which the appellant was given the relevant information by Mr Byrne and Mr Billing. One version was propounded by the appellant and supported largely by Mr Billing (and, to a degree, by Mr Kotarski). The other version was that of Mr Byrne, supported in a material respect by Mr Lerve. 
      
       
        
        
        
       The Billing Version 
        
       
     52    Essentially, the appellant and Mr Billing testified that, after lunch, the appellant remained undecided as to whether he should plead guilty. Mr Byrne then remarked that he ought to speak to the Crown Prosecutor and see the judge to inform her that the appellant had not made a decision. With that, Mr Byrne departed to see the judge. Thus, according to the appellant and Mr Billing, Mr Byrne left to see the judge at a stage when the appellant had not decided to plead guilty.  
      
       
     53    There were several internal inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, generally. He shifted ground whenever he thought it to his benefit to do so. I do not regard him as a credible witness. There is therefore little point in recording his testimony on this issue, and I shall not do so. 
      
       
     54    According to Mr Billing, when Mr Byrne returned from seeing the judge, he said words to the effect: 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown Prosecutor and I have just been speaking with the judge and she is genuinely concerned about you and does not want to have to convict you on the more serious charge if the jury finds you guilty on that charge. If this happens she will have to sentence you accordingly. She thinks that because of the way the evidence came out and particularly [the appellant’s wife’s] evidence that the jury may have formed a view about you which could put you at risk of being convicted of the more serious charge and she thinks the jury will probably on the evidence find you guilty of the less serious offence”. 
         
        
       
     55    Mr Byrne suggested that the appellant discuss what he had been told with his family. This occurred and, thereafter, the appellant told Mr Billing and Mr Byrne that he had decided to plead guilty.  
      
       
     56    A file note made by Mr Billing for 3 June 1999 was in evidence. This read: 
      
       
        
         
         “On second day of trial (see file note) offer by Crown to accept plea on secondary indictment indecent assault[. J]udge strongly recommended [the appellant] take this course as likely could be convicted on more serious charge …” 
         
        
        
       Mr Billing said that to the extent that the file note was inconsistent with his other evidence, it was wrong. He said that the note was not intended to be an accurate record of what had occurred. It was made for costing purposes. 
        
       
     57    Mr Kotarski testified that at lunch on 3 June 1999, he spoke to the appellant about whether he should plead guilty. The appellant had not yet made a decision. He told Mr Kotarski that his lawyers had spoken to the judge who advised them that he should plead guilty to the lesser charge. 
      
       
        
       The Byrne Version 
        
       
     58    Mr Byrne testified that at the end of the luncheon adjournment the appellant had still not made a decision and needed more time. A message was sent to Karpin DC and further time was granted.  
      
       
     59    According to Mr Byrne, at about 2.45 pm on 3 June 1999, the appellant told Mr Billing in Mr Byrne’s presence that he had decided to plead guilty to the charge of indecent assault. These instructions were entirely unconditional. Mr Byrne then suggested to Mr Billing that he obtain written instructions concerning the plea of guilty. 
      
       
     60    Mr Byrne and Mr Lerve thereupon attended upon Karpin DCJ. They informed her of the plea and she said that if the jury had found the appellant guilty of the sexual intercourse charge she would have to have taken a very serious view of it. Mr Byrne asked Karpin DCJ permission to tell the appellant what she had said and she agreed. She said she would herself say something to the appellant when the court resumed.  
      
       
     61    At first Mr Byrne said that he was uncertain why he made that inquiry of the learned judge but, at a later stage in his evidence, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well, [the appellant] had a difficulty in acknowledging the situation in which he was and in which I perceived to have been anyway. I had already told him that if he were convicted of the more serious charge that he could expect a substantial sentence. He knew that. I had told him that. That he would get a lesser sentence, of course, if he were convicted of the lesser charge. I believe that my purpose in wanting [the appellant] to know what the judge said was to make him feel more comfortable about the decision he had made …” 
         
        
       
     62    Mr Byrne’s account of what occurred after lunch had not always been the same. When Mr Byrne was cross-examined, he accepted that four days earlier (that is, four days before he testified) he had told Mr Game that he had gone to see Karpin DCJ for the purpose of getting more time pending the obtaining of instructions on the plea of guilty. In other words, his statement to Mr Game was entirely consistent with the evidence of the appellant and Mr Billing.  
      
       
     63    Further, Mr Byrne accepted that, four days earlier, he had told Mr Game that Karpin DCJ said to him that if the appellant was found guilty of the main charge: 
      
       
        
         
         “She would have to take a very serious view of it”. 
         
        
        
       Some time after that conversation, and before Mr Byrne gave oral testimony in the appeal, he telephoned Mr Game and told him that what he, Mr Byrne, had said to Mr Game previously was wrong and Karpin DCJ had indicated, rather, that if the appellant  
       had been 
        found guilty of the main charge, which was a real possibility, she would have had to have taken a very serious view of the matter. Mr Byrne’s statement to Mr Game 
         
       on this aspect was also consistent with the evidence of the appellant and Mr Billing. 
        
       
     64    Mr Byrne said that after re-reading the transcript of the evidence given at the trial (and, in particular, the remarks that Karpin DCJ had made in the course of sentencing the appellant) he had concluded that the information he had so given Mr Game was wrong. 
      
       
     65    An affidavit by Mr Lerve, the Crown Prosecutor, was filed. According to this affidavit, at about 2.00 pm on 3 June 1999, Mr Byrne spoke to Mr Lerve and said that the appellant would be pleading to the alternate count. It was then agreed between Mr Lerve and Mr Byrne that they should attend upon Karpin DCJ in chambers and inform her Honour of what was to take place. The affidavit by Mr Lerve proceeded: 
      
       
        
         
         “My recollection is that Mr Byrne said to her Honour, in my presence and hearing, words to the effect of ‘My client will be pleading to the alternative count’. It is my recollection that prior [sic] [counsel] saying those words, her Honour had said nothing more to either Mr Byrne or myself other than words to the effect of, ‘Good afternoon gentleman’, or some similar type of greeting”. 
         
        
        
       As I have mentioned, Mr Lerve was not cross-examined.  
        
        
       The written instructions and the entering of the plea 
        
       
     66    Once the appellant had decided to plead guilty, Mr Byrne suggested to Mr Billing that he obtain written instructions from the appellant. Mr Billing then wrote out a form of written instructions and read the words to the appellant as he wrote them.  
      
       
     67    The appellant signed the instructions which were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I confirm my instructions as at 2.45 pm today to plead guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault in making that decision I have had regard to the view expressed by the judge that there is a distinct possibility that I may be convicted of the more serious charge the probability that I will be convicted of the lesser charge. I have taken into account the additional gaol term I would face if convicted of the more serious charge and the lesser term I can expect to receive on pleading guilty to the lesser charge now while the offer is available. I have also taken into account my own assessment of the way the evidence in the case is going and the probability that the jury will convict me of the lesser charge and the distinct possibility that I could be convicted of the more serious charge. 
         
        
        
         
         Signed KCH 3.5.99 
         ” 
         
        
       
     68    Mr Byrne was not able to remember when he first read the written instructions. He did say, however, that it would not have been long after they were signed. My impression of the general tenor of Mr Byrne’s evidence was that he had read the instructions by the end of 4 June 1999. 
      
       
     69    Mr Byrne said that when he read the instructions he was surprised that it recorded that the appellant had had regard to what the judge had said. He was surprised because, according to him, the appellant had made up his mind to plead guilty before the written instructions were signed and the instructions recorded that in making the decision to plead guilty, the appellant had had regard to the views expressed by the judge. Mr Byrne accepted that the instructions were false in that respect.  
      
       
     70    Mr Byrne initially said that the false statement in the instructions caused him some concern. Later, he said that it did not. In any event, he took no steps to remedy the position. 
      
       
     71    After the written instructions had been signed, the court reassembled, the appellant was eventually reindicted, a plea of not guilty was entered to the first count and a plea of guilty was entered to the alternative count. Mr Lerve then accepted that plea of guilty in full discharge of the indictment presented against the appellant. 
      
       
     72    The judge was formally informed in open court that the appellant was to plead guilty to the alternate count. She then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well, I can only say this to you, that I regard that as a wise decision in view of the way in which the Crown evidence has emerged in this trial and you no doubt appreciate that in pleading guilty to the alternate charge and indeed in entering a plea of guilty even at this late stage the Court is bound to give you some mitigation of the penalty which would otherwise be imposed upon you were the jury to have returned a verdict of guilty in respect of certainly the first count but even of the second count”. 
         
        
        
       The appellant’s intention to appeal 
        
       
     73    According to the appellant, at the very moment he decided to plead guilty, he decided, also, that he would appeal. He said that he thought, by pleading guilty, he would “protect” the defence evidence. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I felt that if the trial had have continued the way it was going more evidence would have been damaged or wouldn’t have been brought out in the way that I felt it should have been …” 
         
        
       
     74    According to the appellant, immediately after pleading guilty, while he was in the holding cell, he maintained that he was innocent. The appellant asked Mr Byrne there and then about an appeal and was told “you can also appeal, … there is no time limit”.  
      
       
     75    According to both Mr Byrne and Mr Billing, there was some discussion between the appellant and Mr Byrne before he was sentenced concerning a possible appeal. They both said, however, that it was not made clear whether the appeal that the appellant had in mind concerned conviction or sentence. They understood him to be referring to a possible appeal against sentence should that turn out to be higher than expected. 
      
       
     76    According to Mr Byrne, at some period after the appellant was convicted and before he was sentenced he, Mr Byrne, was told by Mr Billing that the appellant had changed his mind about pleading guilty and that later that he had changed his mind back again.  
      
       
        
       Factual findings as to what the appellant was told concerning the judge’s views 
        
        
       
     77    I have already expressed the view that the appellant was not a reliable witness.  
      
       
     78    Mr Billing’s note of 3 June 1999 tells against his general accuracy as an observer. Understandably, he had some difficulty recalling with accuracy precisely what had occurred. Nevertheless, I thought he was an honest witness.  
      
       
     79    I had some difficulties with Mr Byrne’s evidence. I was particularly concerned with the changes in his testimony after he first spoke to Mr Game. I thought he had a tendency to reconstruct what had occurred. I was not satisfied that his testimony was generally reliable, in the sense of being accurate. 
      
       
     80    A crucial area for resolution is whether the written instructions accurately reflected what had occurred. That is, did Mr Byrne report the judge’s views to Mr Billing and the appellant before the appellant decided to plead guilty, or thereafter. Mr Billing was not pressed by the Crown as to whether he was correct in saying that the reason for Mr Byrne seeing the judge was to obtain more time to enable the appellant to decide whether to plead guilty. On the other hand, Mr Game did not cross-examine Mr Byrne directly as to his evidence that he saw the judge to tell her that the appellant had decided to plead guilty.  
      
       
     81    But for the affidavit of Mr Lerve, I would have preferred Mr Billing’s testimony to that of Mr Byrne. That is because of my general views as to their reliability as witnesses and also because of the specific terms of the written instructions. But Mr Lerve’s uncontested testimony was that he and Mr Byrne saw the judge to tell her that the appellant was pleading guilty. That is powerful support for Mr Byrne. 
      
       
     82    In the end I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that the appellant was told of the judge’s views before he decided to plead guilty.  
      
       
     83    Nevertheless, it is quite plain in my view that at least when the written instructions were read out to the appellant by Mr Billing, the appellant was informed of the judge’s supposed views as recorded therein.  
      
       
     84    On the evidence before the Court I am not able to come to a conclusion as to whether Mr Byrne incorrectly reported the judge as expressing the views set out in the written instructions or whether Mr Billing was responsible for the incorrect record of the instructions. In any event a decision on this issue is not relevant to the resolution of this appeal.  
      
       
        
       The effect of the appellant being told of the judge’s views, even if this occurred after he had decided to plead guilty 
        
       
     85    Mr Byrne said that the Crown first offered the plea at about 11.30 am on 3 June 1999. Mr Lerve said that he first offered the plea prior to the jury being empanelled on 2 June 1999. Accepting Mr Byrne’s evidence that he told the appellant of the plea at about 11.30 am on 3 June 1999, it is clear that for about three hours the appellant resisted the idea of pleading guilty. Both Mr Byrne and Mr Billing had given him strong advice that his case was going badly, and he was of the same view. Nevertheless, throughout this period he was reluctant to plead.  
      
       
     86    I have referred to Mr Byrne’s evidence that the appellant had difficulty in acknowledging the situation which he was in and the fact that Mr Byrne’s purpose in wanting the appellant to know what the judge said was “to make him feel more comfortable about the decision he had made …”.  
      
       
     87    Mr Billing accepted that the news of the judge’s views was an important factor in persuading the appellant to plead. The appellant, himself, when asked in cross-examination, what effect the judge’s views had on his decision to plead guilty he said, “I think that virtually swung it that way”.  
      
       
     88    I appreciate that I have not found that the advice as to the judge’s views brought about the appellant’s decision to plead guilty, but it is a very easy step in the light of all the evidence to find that the report as to the judge’s views must have been important in persuading the appellant to maintain his decision until the plea of guilty was entered. In my opinion, that is what occurred. 
      
       
     89    The issue can be approached in another way. In Rosenberg v Percival (2001) 75 ALJR 734; [2001] HCA 18, McHugh J at para 44 observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “Courts frequently make findings as to states of mind based on nothing more than the objective facts and probabilities of the case. But usually such findings refer to the mental state that simultaneously accompanied some act or omission of a person. … The very doing of the act or the omitting to do the act, when considered in its context, generally throws much light on the mental state of the person concerned”.  
         
        
       
     90    The state of mind that I am now dealing with is that of the appellant when deciding to maintain his decision to plead guilty from the time he was told of the views expressed by Karpin DCJ until he entered his plea. It was of course open to him to change his mind. He did not do so and eventually he caused his plea to be entered. On the objective facts and probabilities of the case, I conclude that the information given to him as to the views allegedly expressed by Karpin DCJ influenced him in maintaining his decision to plead guilty to the lesser charge.  
      
       
        
       What is the effect of there being other operative causes for the appellant maintaining his decision to plead guilty? 
        
       
     91    There were several causes for the appellant’s decision to plead guilty to the lesser charge and to maintain that decison until the plea was entered. One of these was his fear that he might be found guilty on the more serious charge. Another was that if he pleaded guilty he was likely to receive some discount. Yet another was that in some misguided way he thought he could ‘protect” the witnesses who were to testify on his behalf by not having them testify before a judge whom he believed to be hostile and in a case where the evidence that had been led had gone against him.  
      
       
     92    These were tactical reasons. They have to be seen in context. The appellant fully understood that, by pleading guilty, he was announcing to the world at large that he was indeed guilty. I do not accept that once he decided to plead guilty he attached any conditions to his plea. The plea was made unconditionally, with full knowledge of what it entailed. It was made knowingly and deliberately, after weighing up all the known relevant circumstances.  
      
       
     93    I appreciate that in Maxwell v The Queen Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 511 that even the “desire to gain a technical advantage” may result in a plea of guilty not being an admission of guilt. With respect, however, I do not understand a “technical advantage” to apply to or include the situation where an accused person, without any undue or improper pressure, freely and voluntarily makes a decision to plead guilty to one offence, not because he believes that he is guilty, but because he thinks that this is a good way of avoiding the risk of being found guilty of other offences, or of receiving a reduced sentence, or of protecting his evidence with a view to bringing an appeal at a later stage.  
      
       
     94    As long as the decision to plead guilty was made freely and voluntarily, the decision stands. This is the necessary corollary of the principle laid down in Maxwell v The Queen at 511 that if the plea of guilty is genuine, and the accused person knows what he is doing, he may, for “whatever reason” insist on pleading guilty.  
      
       
     95    It follows, therefore, that the sole argument on which the appellant may rely is that, despite the other reasons that operated on his mind, the advice given to him as to the opinions expressed by Karpin DCJ procured his plea by improper pressure and thereby resulted in an absence of a free choice on his part. In essence this is a question of causation. 
      
       
     96    Although this question arises in the course of criminal proceedings, it is not the usual kind of causation question well-known to the criminal law, that is, whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that a particular act led to a particular result.  
      
       
     97    In Chappel v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 232 Gaudron J at 238 said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Questions of causation are not answered in a legal vacuum. Rather, they are answered in a legal framework in which they arise.” 
         
        
       
     98    The legal framework derives from the very question of causation that arises. In the light of my findings, the relevant circumstances must be taken to be as follows. Firstly, there were several factors that initially caused the appellant to decide to plead guilty. Secondly, those factors did not include the information about the views allegedly expressed by Karpin DCJ. Thirdly, the appellant maintained that decision because of all those factors, plus the information about her Honour’s views. The question then is: in these circumstances, was the entering of the plea procured by improper pressure?  
      
       
     99    But I think there is more to say on the score of the legal framework in which the question falls to be answered.  
      
       
     100    The law regards the need for a plea of guilty to be freely and voluntarily made as a fundamental element of the administration of justice. Thus, as Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ said in Meissner v The Queen (at 142): 
      
       
        
         
         “If conduct has the tendency to induce a person to plead guilty when that person would have pleaded not guilty had he or she exercised a free choice in his or her own interests, the  
         actus reus 
          of an attempt to pervert the course of justice is established”. 
         
        
       
     101    It follows that legal practitioners who represent accused persons owe a duty to the court not to bring improper pressure to bear on their clients to plead guilty. In particular, that duty would be breached by a practitioner deliberately or negligently giving the client false information that the trial judge had expressed a particular opinion as to the prospects of the client being found guilty. Such a duty is part of the general duty not to corrupt the administration of justice which in turn is derived from the public interest in ensuring that the administration of justice is not subverted or distorted by dishonest or negligent practices. 
      
       
     102    Thus, part of the relevant legal framework is that false advice by an accused person’s lawyer that the trial judge had expressed views about that person’s prospects of being found guilty may constitute a breach of duty on the part of the lawyer and amount to improper pressure.  
      
       
     103    In these circumstances, it is appropriate to regard a decision to enter a plea of guilty as having been procured by improper pressure when such advice materially contributes to the maintenance (until the plea is entered) of an earlier decision to plead guilty. In my view, the advice will be regarded as having materially contributed to the maintenance of the decision if it was likely to influence the client in acting in the way that he or she in fact did act (cf Chappel v Hart per Gaudron J at 238 to 239, per McHugh J at 244 to 245, per Kirby J at 268 et seq).  
      
       
        
       Conclusion as to appeal against conviction 
        
       
     104    I have concluded that the statement made to the appellant as to the views allegedly expressed by Karpin DCJ influenced him in maintaining his decision to plead guilty to the lesser charge. 
      
       
     105    In my opinion, the consequence is that the plea was procured by improper pressure of a most serious kind and was not made with a free choice. The fact that other reasons also contributed to that decision does not detract from this conclusion. 
      
       
     106    I have concluded that, in the circumstances, it follows inevitably that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and whether there might be a real question about the appellant’s guilt is irrelevant. 
      
       
     107    Accordingly, I would uphold the appeal against conviction, allow the appellant to withdraw his guilty plea, set aside the conviction, and order a new trial.  
      
       
        
       Appeal against sentence 
        
       
     108    In the light of my conclusions in regard to the appeal against conviction it is not strictly necessary for me to deal with the appeal against sentence. In case the matter should be taken further I shall express my views briefly in regard to the sentence appeal.  
      
       
     109    In my opinion, it was open to Karpin DCJ on the evidence to sentence the appellant on the basis that the indecent assault was but one of a series of like incidents. It was also open to her Honour on the evidence to sentence him on the basis that the indecent assault involved ejaculation on his part.  
      
       
     110    In arguing that the sentence was manifestly excessive, Mr Game drew attention to the fact that Karpin DCJ had accorded the appellant what she described as “a limited amount of mitigation of penalty” by reason of his plea of guilty. Her Honour said that this followed because of the lateness of the plea. In my view, this approach was entirely justified and there is nothing in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 to the contrary.  
      
       
     111    In my opinion, having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the sentence imposed was not excessive and was within discretion.  
      
       
     112    I turn now to the ground that the sentence miscarried by reason of the failure of Mr Byrne to obtain the appellant’s instructions with respect to the factual basis of the guilty plea and to put his case fully in regard to sentence.  
      
       
     113    The appellant was in fact sentenced on 11 June 1999. In his evidence, Mr Byrne said that there was no discussion between him and the appellant as to the factual basis upon which the appellant might be sentenced. In particular, there was no discussion between them about the appellant being sentenced on the basis that the charge to which he had pleaded guilty was but one of a multiplicity of incidents of indecent assault. Nor was there any discussion between them about the prospect of him being sentenced on the basis that he had an erect penis at the time he was in bed with the complainant and that he ejaculated at that time.  
      
       
     114    It came as a surprise to Mr Byrne that the appellant in fact was sentenced on the basis that the offence was one of a multiplicity of incidents and that he ejaculated at the time. I have held that findings to this effect were open to her Honour on the evidence. Nevertheless, at the relevant time, Mr Byrne did not think that the first mentioned finding would be made (because her Honour had told the jury that they had to look at the incident as one isolated event) and appears not to have applied his mind to the possibility of the latter finding being made (albeit that the Crown made submissions concerning the relevance of the ejaculation to the sentence that should be imposed).  
      
       
     115    The appellant had not admitted to Mr Byrne that there was more than one incident of the kind which formed the basis of his conviction and had denied that he had ejaculated while in the complainant’s bed. He was entitled to have his version in regard to these issues put to the learned judge. Not only was it not put, but after the Crown had made submissions in regard to sentence, Mr Byrne said: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is nothing that could be said in connection with the circumstances of the offences”. 
         
        
       
     116    In consequence, through no fault of the appellant, Karpin DCJ sentenced him on facts which to the knowledge of his counsel he did not admit.  
      
       
     117    In the circumstances I consider that the sentencing process miscarried and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Had I not been of the view that the appeal against conviction should succeed, I would have proposed that the appeal against sentence be upheld and the matter be remitted to the District Court for re-sentencing.  
      
       
     118    HULME J: On 2 June 1999 the Appellant was indicted on two counts, one of having sexual intercourse with a girl of 6 years of age and the second, an alternative count, of indecent assault of her. The first charge carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, the second of 10 years imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty. On 3 June 1999 the Crown indicated it was willing to accept a plea to the second count in full satisfaction of the indictment and the Appellant decided to accept that offer. He so indicated. He was re-indicted, pleaded not guilty to the first count and guilty to the second and shortly thereafter the jury brought in verdicts in accordance with those pleas. 
      
       
     119    On 11 June Judge Karpin sentenced the Appellant to imprisonment for a minimum term of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 3 June 1999 and an additional term of 2 years.  
      
       
     120    In these proceedings the Appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks to withdraw his plea. There is also an application to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     121    In support of the conviction and plea claims, it has been submitted that:- 
      
       
        
         
         (i) advice to the Appellant to the effect that he was in serious jeopardy of being convicted on the more serious charge was grossly wrong in that there was no realistic prospect of such a conviction, 
          
          
         (ii) the Appellant was not adequately represented at his trial and that the complainant’s account of events was not properly tested in cross-examination, 
          
          
         (iii) The Appellant’s attention was not drawn to the material issue of acceptance by him of his guilt by his plea, and the plea was not made in circumstances suggesting a genuine consciousness of guilt.  
          
         
        
       
     122    Reliance was also placed on the fact and impact on the Appellant of advice he received as to what the trial judge either had or was reported to have said at about the time of the plea. 
      
       
     123    So far as the first two of these complaints are concerned, I am content to record my agreement with what Ipp AJA has said. I prefer to deal with the other matters in my own words. In summary the evidence concerning them is as follows. 
      
       
     124    According to the Appellant, during the morning of 3 June - the precise time does not matter – his counsel informed him that the Crown had offered to drop the more serious charge if the Appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of indecent assault. The Appellant declined the offer.  
      
       
     125    At around lunch time counsel informed the Appellant that the trial was not going as well as had been expected and that he was becoming worried and the Appellant should think about the earlier offer over lunch. After lunch the Appellant again asserted he wanted to continue with the trial.  
      
       
     126    Later, at a time the Appellant describes as the next break, counsel said to him:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I’ve just spoken with the Judge in Chambers and she said to me that she doesn’t want to see you convicted of the more serious charges (sic) and strongly urges you to plead guilty to the lesser charge. She said that when we go back into court she is going to speak to you and urge you to do that. 
          
          
         The offer by the Crown is still open but it will be withdrawn by end of the Crown evidence and there is only the forensic evidence left.” 
          
         
        
       
     127    According to the Appellant there was further conversation in the course of which he reiterated that he did not wish to plead guilty and, in the presence of his counsel his solicitor said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “It’s your decision and only you can make it, but it looks hopeless and Ian and I don’t want to see you do more years in jail than you have to. The Judge has strongly urged you to accept the lesser charge and doesn’t want to see you spend more time in jail than you have to. Ian and I urge you to think about it very seriously.” 
          
         
        
       
     128    The discussion continued, counsel urging the Appellant to accept the Crown offer saying, inter alia,:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown think their case is very strong. It looks certain that you will be convicted on the lesser charge and if the jury goes against you on that, there is a real danger that they will also go against you on the higher charge.” 
          
         
        
       
     129    Eventually the Appellant acquiesced saying:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I will do it. I will plead guilty to the lesser charge, but I want it said in court and put down on the court record, that I am not guilty but I will plead to the lesser charge if that will avoid the higher charge.” 
          
         
        
       
     130    The Appellant’s solicitor requested the Appellant to provide written instructions. According to the Appellant he was going into shock and was so distressed that he could not think clearly nor write properly. His solicitor offered to write out the instructions. He did so and the Appellant signed the document. The instructions were in these terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “I confirm my instructions as at 2.45pm today to plead guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault in making (sic) that decision I have had regard to the view expressed by the Judge that there is a distinct possibility that I may be convicted of the more serious charge the probability that I will be convicted of the lesser charge. 
          
          
         I have taken into account the additional jail term I would face if convicted of the more serious charge and the lesser term I can expect to receive on pleading guilty to the lesser charge now while the offer is available. I have also taken into account my own assessment of the way the evidence in the case is going and the probability that the jury will convict me of the lesser charge and the distinct possibility that I could be convicted of the more serious charge. 
          
         
        
       
     131    The proceedings then resumed in court. The transcript is somewhat fuller than the Appellant’s account and I quote from it. Her Honour said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Mr Hogg I understand from what your counsel says and from what the Crown tells me that when the jury returns to the court room that you are seeking to be re-indicted and you will then plead guilty to the alternate count in the indictment. That is so I understand. Well I can only say this to you, that I regard that as a wise decision in view of the way in which the Crown evidence has emerged in this trial and you no doubt appreciate that in pleading guilty to the alternate charge and indeed in entering a plea of guilty even at this late stage, the Court is bound to give you some mitigation of the penalty which would otherwise be imposed upon you were the jury to have returned a verdict of guilty in respect of certainly the first count but even of the second count.” 
          
         
        
       
     132    It was then the Appellant was re-indicted and convicted. No one said anything about the Appellant being innocent of both charges. 
      
       
     133    During oral evidence given during the appeal the Appellant acknowledged that it had been made clear to him that ultimately the decision about pleading was a matter for him. He identified a number of factors as having influenced him in his decision. Included in these were that he was unhappy with his legal representatives who had declined to introduce issues the Appellant saw as relevant and who had apparently not committed themselves to calling some witnesses the Appellant wanted on issues of both character and of lack of fear on the part of the complainant. He thought that unless there was a change of direction in the trial or unless his counsel did something of a different nature, the result would be adverse and it was desirable to stop the trial and “protect” some evidence. He thought the lawyers had made a mess of the trial. 
      
       
     134    Other reasons included:- 
      
       
        
         
         He thought it was in his interest to plead guilty to the lesser charge; 
          
          
         Because of the way the evidence was going he thought he was in danger of being convicted on the more serious charge which carried a longer gaol term; 
          
          
         As he had been told by his counsel, the trial was not going well; 
          
          
         His own assessment was that probably he would be convicted anyway. (Earlier in his evidence he had disagreed with this proposition.); and 
          
          
         He would receive some discount on sentence. 
          
         
        
       
     135    The Appellant also said that he pleaded guilty because he was told that without doubt he would be convicted of the lesser charge and was in extreme jeopardy of being convicted of the higher charge as well. This information was largely provided by counsel “but it was backed up by Mr Billing and I do note the comments from the judge.” 
      
       
     136    So far as the reported statements of the judge were concerned, the Appellant said that he was influenced by these “because I felt that the judge had found in favour against me that I was being pre-judged.” (I have quoted the answer as transcribed. It may be that the transcript should have recorded a dash between “me” and “that”.) Asked elsewhere as to the effect of what the judge was reported to have said, the Appellant said, “I think that virtually swung it that way … because I felt that there was no hope.”. 
      
       
     137    The Appellant also said that when pleading guilty before Judge Karpin he did not understand that he was confessing to what was alleged against him. I shall refer further to this topic below. 
      
       
     138    On the hearing of the appeal, in addition to evidence from the Appellant, affidavits of a Mr Kotarski who was a friend or acquaintance and who was at court on the day, Mr Lerve who had been the Crown Prosecutor at the trial and both Mr Byrne and Mr Billing, respectively counsel and solicitor who had appeared for the Appellant were read. All of these persons except the Crown Prosecutor also gave oral evidence and were cross-examined. There were significant differences in the accounts of what occurred. 
      
       
     139    Among the issues which arise are:- 
      
       
        
         
          (i) when, relative to the Appellant’s decision to plead, any comments by the judge were made, 
          
          
          (ii) what were their terms, and  
          
          
         (iii) what was said to the Appellant as to them.  
          
         
        
       
     140    According to Mr Lerve, counsel attended on Judge Karpin only once and this was after Mr Byrne had said that the Appellant would be taking advantage of the offer to plead to the alternate count. Mr Lerve also said that the subject of sentence was not raised and he was confident that her Honour did not say words to the effect “I strongly recommend Mr Hogg enter a plea of guilty to the lesser charge, as it is likely that he will be convicted of the more serious charge.”  
      
       
     141    Mr Lerve said that he had no memory of Judge Karpin saying words to the effect:- 
      
       
        
         
         “There is a distinct possibility that Mr Hogg will be convicted of the more serious charge”, or 
          
          
         “There is a probability of Mr Hogg being convicted of the lesser charge. 
          
         
        
       
     142    I should record also that Mr Lerve said that the sittings at which the Appellant was tried were very busy. Among other events 20 trials were disposed of, and he does not have a perfect memory of everything that occurred or that was said in each of the matters.  
      
       
     143    In his affidavit sworn on 19 July Mr Byrne also said that, so far as is presently relevant, he and the Crown Prosecutor attended on her Honour only once and that this was after the Appellant had decided to plead guilty and for the purpose of informing her Honour of the fact. Mr Byrne did acknowledge that in a telephone conference on Monday 16 July with Mr Game who appeared for the Appellant before this Court, he had said that the judge had been seen earlier with a view to obtaining more time for the obtaining of instructions on the issue of the plea but that he had subsequently read the transcript including her Honour’s remarks which I have quoted above and other documents and had been reminded that there had been only the one visit. 
      
       
     144    Mr Byrne said that when he and the Crown Prosecutor attended on her Honour in chambers to inform her of the change of plea - 
      
       
        
         
         “She said words to the effect that if the jury had found Mr Hogg guilty of the sexual intercourse charge, which was a real possibly she would have to have taken a very serious view of it. She gave me permission to tell Mr Hogg what she had said and informed me that she would say something to Mr Hogg herself when court resumed.” 
          
         
        
       
     145    Mr Byrne said that he had informed the Appellant of what the judge had said. In oral evidence Mr Byrne denied that the judge had urged the Appellant to do anything or that the Appellant had been informed to this effect.  
      
       
     146    Mr Byrne also deposed to having asked her Honour for, and been given, permission to pass on what her Honour had said. He was asked why he had sought this permission. At one stage he said that he was uncertain but probably to give the Appellant the feeling that he had made the proper decision. Later, in response to a similar question he said that the Appellant had difficulty in acknowledging the situation he was in or which Mr Byrne perceived him to be in and that he wanted the Appellant to feel more comfortable about the decision he had made.  
      
       
     147    Quite apart from reporting remarks of her Honour, Mr Byrne also provided to the Appellant his own assessment of how the trial was going. This was to the effect that it was going very badly and that the evidence since morning tea on the second day had worsened the Appellant’s position. A consideration of the transcript provides much support for this assessment. 
      
       
     148    Mr Billing said that his recollection was that counsel went to see the Judge only once but Mr Billing placed this visit prior to the Appellant’s decision to plead. Mr Billing’s account of the passing on of the Judge’s opinion was that Mr Byrne said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown Prosecutor and I have just been speaking with the Judge and she is genuinely concerned about you and does not want to have to convict you on the more serious charge if the jury finds you guilty on that charge. If this happens, she will have to sentence you accordingly. She thinks that because of the way the evidence came out and particularly Judit’s (the complaint’s mother’s) evidence that the jury may have formed a view about you which could put you at risk of being convicted of the more serious charge and she thinks the jury will probably on the evidence find you guilty of the less serious offence.” 
          
         
        
       
     149    On the topic of the written instructions, Mr Billing said that he read this document to the Appellant as it was written and the Appellant appeared to read it before signing. Both Mr Billing and Mr Byrne say that the latter was not present when the document was being written. Mr Billing’s recollection was that Mr Byrne saw it soon after, while Mr Byrne said that he could not say more than that he saw it sometime between its signing and sentence a week later. Mr Byrne was cross-examined on the statement in the document to the effect that in making his decision the Appellant had regard to views of the judge which, according to Mr Byrne, were only expressed after the decision was made and the disparity between his account of what the judge had said and the statement in the document to the effect that the judge had said that there was a probability of the Appellant being convicted of the lesser charge.  
      
       
     150    Mr Byrne said that on reading the document he had been surprised at these matters. At one stage Mr Byrne said that he thought he expressed his surprise to Mr Billing. At another he said that he could not recall saying anything to Mr Billing about the signed instructions. 
      
       
     151    Given the extent of the inconsistency in the above evidence I have not found it easy to decide between the various accounts in relation to many of the issues that arise. However it is necessary, at least in the case of some, to do so. Given the difficulty, it is important to record that as it is the Appellant who contends that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he bears the onus of demonstrating the fact – Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 37 and to the extent to which this depends on the resolution of matters of fact, he bears the onus of establishing the necessary facts – R v Ross (unreported, CCA, 20 April 1994).  
      
       
     152    Firstly, I should say that the Appellant was an unimpressive witness. It is not necessary that I detail all of the factors and evidence which lead me to this conclusion but it may be appropriate to mention one topic. The Appellant gave evidence that he had 2 prior convictions for assault following pleas of guilty. In relation to those charges he had understood that by pleading guilty he was confessing what he had done. Nevertheless he asserted that when pleading guilty before Judge Karpin he did not understand that he was confessing to what was alleged against him. He said that he “was just saying that I was guilty to avoid a higher charge” and that he did not know what the plea involved. Mr Byrne conceded that there was no specific conversation between himself and the Appellant to the effect that by pleading guilty the Appellant was accepting that he was guilty of intending an indecent assault on the complainant. 
      
       
     153    It may not be irrelevant that the Appellant had devoted his time in gaol to researching aspects of the law, including cases on urgings by judges. But be that as it may, the Appellant’s evidence as to his prior pleas of guilty and the undisputed evidence of what had occurred leading to the charges before Judge Karpin lead inescapably to the conclusion that he did understand the principal significance of his plea, viz. that he had indecently assaulted the complainant at least to the extent of climbing into her bunk, pulling down his and her pants and lying against her with his penis adjacent to her genitalia or anus.  
      
       
     154    I am not persuaded that the Appellant’s agreement to plead to the lesser charge was accompanied by a statement to the effect that he was not guilty or that he wanted some notation to that effect made in court. It is in the highest degree improbable that any legal adviser could or would accept instructions to plead guilty accompanied by such a qualification and both the Appellant’s then counsel and solicitor deny that any such qualification was made. The Appellant made no attempt to accompany his plea of guilty by any such statement. 
      
       
     155    I am also not persuaded that counsel saw the Judge or that any purported communication of her Honour’s views occurred prior to the Appellant deciding to plead guilty. Given his change of recollection, one can not place a great deal of weight on Mr Byrne’s evidence in this regard, but the absence of challenge to it means that Mr Lerve’s evidence must be given considerable weight. Mr Billing’s recollection is, of course, to the contrary and on balance, so are the terms of the written instructions to which I have referred. On the other hand, those terms are also explicable on the basis that Mr Billing was concerned to have recorded all of the matters which did or may have operated on the Appellant’s mind that day and argued for the entry of a plea. Mr Byrne gave evidence, which I find easy to accept, that the Appellant seemed disposed to blame everyone else but himself. 
      
       
     156    It is appropriate to record also that the affidavits demonstrate that Mr Billing had a deal of difficulty in arriving at what he regarded as a satisfactory recollection of events. Furthermore, he was shown not to be meticulous in his documentation. Thus an entry in Mr Billing’s “Attendance Report” for costing purposes for 3 June 1999 is in terms:- 
      
       
        
         
         “on second day of trial (see file note) offer by Crown to accept plea on secondary indictment indecent assault Judge strongly recommended Kevin take this course as likely could be convicted on more serious charge after lengthy family discussions Kevin decided plead to secondary charge refused bail …” (sic) 
          
          
         
        
       
     157    Clearly the references to “strongly recommended” and “likely” are inconsistent with the tenor of the recollections of Messrs Lerve and Byrne and Mr Billing himself said that they were wrong. Mr Billing gave no satisfactory explanation for the error. 
      
       
     158    Thus I am not persuaded that the Appellant was told anything about views of the trial judge prior to his decision to plead guilty. Indeed, I think the probabilities are that he was not. That is not necessarily the end of the matter and I should therefore address the question of what the Appellant was told as to the judge’s remarks prior to making his plea. 
      
       
     159    Given my views of the Appellant’s credibility, I am not disposed to accept his version of the communications in preference to the accounts of others. Primarily because this accords with the probabilities I accept Mr Billing’s evidence that the terms of the written instructions were at least read to the Appellant. However I am not persuaded that previously her Honour’s views were reported to the Appellant any more strongly than deposed to by Mr Byrne. I acknowledge that, in reaching this view, I am not accepting what Mr Billing has said but I am not persuaded that his recollection was not unduly influenced by the terms of the written instructions. Furthermore, I am not persuaded that Mr Byrne saw the written instructions prior to the plea being entered. 
      
       
     160    Mr Byrne’s account is, of course, not significantly more forceful than her Honour’s remarks recorded on the transcript. 
      
       
     161     I turn to the principles of law which apply in this situation. Firstly, there is no doubt that, notwithstanding the Appellant’s plea, the Court does have power to allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and allow the Appellant to withdraw that plea. The foundation of that power lies in the terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act which, subject to a proviso not presently relevant, requires the Court to allow an appeal if there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     162    However it is clear law that a person of sound mind and understanding is entitled to plead guilty if he wishes - see Maxwell v R (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511 - and “provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea … there is no miscarriage of justice if a court does act on such a plea, …even if the person entering into it is not in truth guilty of the offence.” - Meissner v R (1994-1995) 184 CLR 132 at 141. See also at 157 and Maxwell v R (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511. (Whatever may have been meant by “technical advantage” where used on the last mentioned page, I do not regard it as qualifying the statement I have quoted.) 
      
       
     163    The Court was pressed with statements such as those in R v Murphy (1965) VR 187 at 191, R v Davies (unreported, CCA, 16 December 1993), Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36, R v Cincotta (unreported, CCA, 1 November 1995), R v Ganderton (unreported, CCA, 17 September 1998), R v Hura [2001] NSWCCA 61 and R v Wilkes [2001] NSWCCA 97 to the effect that a plea not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt should be set aside. It may well be that reference to a consciousness of guilt was an appropriate test in the circumstances of those cases and obviously any conclusion that a plea was entered in circumstances other than a genuine consciousness of guilt is calculated to inspire questions whether the ingredients essential to its validity and to which the High Court referred in the cases cited were present. However, insofar as the cases to which I have referred suggest that a genuine consciousness of guilt is always necessary, and with due respect to the contrary view expressed in R v Toro-Martinez [2000] NSWCCA 216 at [23-24], those decisions are inconsistent with what was said in the passage from Meissner v R which I have quoted in the immediately preceding paragraph.  
      
       
     164    Thus I do not find it necessary to embark on a consideration of whether the Appellant in fact believed himself guilty of the offence of which he was convicted. The ultimate test is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice - see R v Davies (unreported, CA, 16 December 1993) - but to my mind the issue in this case is whether the Appellant’s plea was “entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the” Appellant. The reference to “in the interests” of the person pleading must mean “with a view to those interests” - see e.g. Meissner v R at p143. It is not to the point that the choice to plead may later be thought, on some balancing of the unmeasurable advantages and disadvantages incidental to the plea, to have been unwise or one that is regretted.  
      
       
     165    As in other areas of the law, there are many circumstances which may make a choice one which is not fairly characterised as “free”. Descriptions in Meissner of circumstances which would deny that a choice was free are where it was the result of “pressure and threats” (p142), intimidation or overbearing (p148), improper inducement or fraud (p157), and improper pressure (p159). In R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 220, Street CJ regarded a plea as not free and voluntary when it was the result partly of an erroneous decision to admit certain evidence of such significance that the judge referred to it as “sudden death” to the Appellant’s case and his counsel said that he could (only) “try to defend” and partly of such remarks. 
      
       
     166    Cases dealing with out of court confessional statements contain many other references to circumstances where t hey will not be regarded as free and voluntary. 
      
       
     167    On the other hand, it is important to recognise that “pressure” in the above context has its limitations. As was said by Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Meissner v R, at 143:- 
      
       
        
         
         “Argument or advice that merely seeks to persuade the accused to plead guilty is not improper conduct for this purpose, no matter how strongly the argument or advice is put. Reasoned argument or advice does not involve the use of improper means and does not have the tendency to prevent the accused from making a free and voluntary choice concerning his or her plea to the charge. As long as the argument or advice does not constitute harassment or other improper pressure and leaves the accused free to make the choice, no interference with the administration of justice occurs.  
          
          
         Conduct is likely to have the tendency to interfere with a person’s free choice to plead not guilty, however, when the conduct consists of a promise or benefit that is offered in consideration of the accused pleading guilty. The difficulty in such cases is to draw the line between offers of assistance that improperly impact on the accused’s freedom of choice and offers of assistance that are legitimate inducements. In most cases, that difficulty can be resolved by determining whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the offer could reasonably be regarded as intended to protect or advance the legitimate interests of the accused having regard to the threat to those interests that arises from the institution of the criminal proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
     168    See also at p149 (per Deane J). And there can be no doubt that persuasion or advice may be expressed in strong terms – see e.g. R v Cincotta (unreported, CCA, 1 November 1995). 
      
       
     169    Upon the findings of fact which I have made there can be no doubt that the Appellant’s decision to plead guilty, made prior to counsel seeing the trial judge was made in the exercise of a free choice. Is it of consequence that what were said to have been views of the judge were then communicated to him? Clearly what was said was of a nature calculated to influence someone who was undecided or having second thoughts but I am not persuaded that the Appellant was in that situation. After lengthy reflection, he had made a decision and he was apparently so far committed to it for the judge to be informed. The Appellant was, of course, still free to change his mind but while I do not say it has never happened, I am not aware of any situation where someone as committed as the Appellant then was has done so. In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the judge’s reported views in fact operated as any inducement leading to the Appellant’s public plea of guilty. 
      
       
     170    In so concluding I do not deny the theoretical possibility that the Judge’s views may have led the Appellant not to reconsider or to change his mind. However he gave no evidence to this effect and it does not seem to me it is a matter which, in the face of his silence on the topic, the Court should assume. 
      
       
     171    Furthermore, I am not persuaded that the expression of a judge’s views or their communication to an accused necessarily means that a decision to plead guilty induced by them is a decision not made in the exercise of a free choice. Whether it is or not in any particular case is simply a question of fact and I am unable to take the view that there is something so commanding in any expression of a judge’s opinion that any decision made thereafter is to be presumed, irrefutably or not, to be made either not in the exercise of freedom of choice or as the result of improper pressure. The law has moved past the development of new legal fictions. Thus, as was the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Pinhassovitch (unreported, 7 February 1994), I am unable to accept the view advanced by Lord Parker CJ in R v Turner (1970) 2 QB 321 at 326 which Ipp AJA has quoted.  
      
       
     172    There remains the question whether, irrespective of the actual or proved impact on the Appellant of the reported views of the trial judge, a miscarriage of justice should be held to have occurred simply because prior to the actual entry of the plea either, the judge expressed views which were communicated to the Appellant, or the representation of those views to the Appellant, at least to the extent to which the terms of the written instructions were communicated, was misleading. 
      
       
     173    So far as the first of these matter is concerned while it is clearly preferable that judges keep to their allotted roles, I see no need to engraft on the established principles laid down by the High Court as to when a plea may be, or lead to, a miscarriage of justice yet another to the effect that a miscarriage of justice will have occurred whenever a plea of guilty is entered following the communication to an accused of what are, or are reportedly, the views of the presiding judge as to the wisdom of such a course or as to the likely result of a trial. 
      
       
     174    So far as the misleading representation of the judge’s views is concerned, I see no reason to treat such a communication differently from any other made in circumstances such as to possibly bear on the entry of a plea. If by evidence or inference it is shown that the plea was not made in the exercise of free choice, or was the result of improper pressure, then a miscarriage has occurred. If the misrepresentation was of a nature or made at a time calculated to influence the decision, then inducement will be readily inferred. However, it is clear law that inducement must be shown. Thus in R v Cincotta (unreported, CCA, 1 November 1995) Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Grove and Allen J agreed, said:- 
      
       
        
         
         “The applicant for such permission (to withdraw a plea) bears the onus of showing the existence of that miscarriage. It will be shown to exist where, for example, the plea was induced by threats or other impropriety … . 
          
         
        
       
     175    On the issue of his conviction, the Appellant has not established that there was any miscarriage of justice and he should not be allowed to withdraw his plea. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
     176    However, for the reasons given by Ipp AJA, there was a miscarriage of justice in relation to the Appellant’s sentence. In that regard leave to appeal should be given, the appeal upheld, the sentence quashed and the Appellant re-sentenced. Given that there are issues of fact to be resolved on the basis of evidence by the complainant and the Appellant, the matter should be remitted under s12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to the District Court for this to occur.  
      
       
     177    SPERLING J: I agree with Ipp AJA.

       McDonald, Wilson & Shepherd v State of New South Wales 
       
      
      
      The appellants’ were serving police officers and members of the NSW Armed Hold-up Squad in 1991. They participated in an operation carried out at the Hilton Hotel in response to information received about an armed robbery that was planned to occur in the early hours of 22 July 1991. The offenders had secreted themselves within the hotel’s false ceiling. The appellants’ role was to man a listening post in the hotel and report the presence of the offenders. The respondent’s plan was to have members of the State Protection Group (SPG) present to engage in any confrontation with the offenders. The planning of the operation took into account the presence of a large number of patrons at Juliana’s nightclub within the vicinity of the relevant area of the hotel, which was to close at approximately 3am. The plan did not envisage that the SPG would arrive at the hotel until after the nightclub closed. 
       
       
      At 1.05am the appellants detected sounds of movement in the ceiling. The SPG was informed. 
       
       
      Prior to the arrival of the SPG (and at about 2.15am) an alarm sounded within the hotel in response to the offenders having fallen through the false ceiling within which they were hiding. The appellants left the listening post and became engaged in a violent confrontation with the offenders. The appellant McDonald was shot in the arm and seeks damages accordingly. All three appellant’s seek damages for nervous shock and psychiatric injury. The three cases were pleaded identically and on appeal the appellants sought to amend a particular within their Statements of Claim. 
       
       
      Held per Meagher, Stein JJA and Davies AJA: 
       
       
      1. The respondent is not prejudiced by the inclusion of the failure of the respondent to ensure the protection of the appellants in the pleadings. A duty to protect is an extension of a duty to evacuate the appellants and the evidence required to address the issue was called at trial. The amendment sought by the appellants to their Statements of Claim is granted. 
       
       
      2. The operational plan was fundamentally deficient. It made no allowance for the foreseeable possibility that the tactical phase of the operation may commence prior to the arrival of the SPG. Due to the fragile nature of the false ceiling it should have been appreciated that the offenders might fall through the roof at any time after they entered the space. The failure of the plan to provide for such a contingency placed the appellants, and indeed the public, at risk. 
       
       
      3. The plan made no provision for the protection of the appellants if the offenders descended from the ceiling prior to the arrival of the SPG. A plan which did provide protection for the appellants had previously been envisaged. It was both necessary and feasible to provide the respondents with protection. 
       
       
      4. The duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to members of the police service is in no way distinguishable from that owed by any other employer to its employees.  
       
       
        
        -

      5. There was a clear breach of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellants. This breach caused the injuries suffered by the respondents.  
       
       
      Orders: 
       
       
      1 Appeals allowed with costs. 
       
       
      2 Judgment and orders in favour of the respondent be set aside. 
       
       
      3 Judgment on the issue of liability in favour of the appellants be substituted therefor. 
       
       
      4 The respondent be ordered to pay the appellants’ costs in the Court below. 
       
       
      5 Remitted to the District Court to assess the appellants’ damages.

      Introduction 
     3    These are three appeals from a judgment of Gibb DCJ delivered in the District Court on 14 April 2000. Her Honour dismissed claims for damages brought by three police officers arising out of injuries received in and arising out of an altercation with two armed would-be offenders during an attempted robbery of the Hilton Hotel, Sydney on 22 July 1991.  
      
      Facts 
     4    In July 1991 the three appellants were New South Wales police officers and members of the Armed Hold-Up Squad. Edward Shepherd and Craig McDonald held the rank of Detective Sergeant, and Mark Wilson was the junior of the three, being a Detective Senior Constable. All were experienced officers. Their damages claims arose out of an operation which was supposed to be carried out in the early hours of 22 July 1991 at the Hilton Hotel, Pitt Street, Sydney. 5    Information had been received by Shepherd and the Armed Hold-Up Squad about an intended robbery of the hotel. The robbery was to be a repeat of one carried out on 2 April 1991 by the same offenders, where approximately $300,000 had been stolen from the hotel strongroom. 6    The two would-be offenders were identified by the informant as being Mr Taousanis and Mr Fred Massih. They were known by police to be dangerous. The appellant McDonald described Taousanis as a ‘vicious cunning criminal’. The appellant Shepherd knew Taousanis to be a ‘very dangerous criminal prepared to shoot at police, heavily armed, ex commando, trained in weapons, very skilful in the use of guns, very dangerous. Also that he was responsible although never charged with a number of murders’. The appellant Wilson was also aware of Taousanis’ ‘violent propensities’, as well as having made inquiries about Massih a few days prior to the operation. 7    According to the information received, the offenders’ plan was to gain access into a false ceiling at a point in or near the foyer on level 7 of the hotel, during the night or early morning. The false ceiling was located two to three feet below the solid concrete ceiling between levels 7 and 8. The ceiling was described in evidence by Mr Geoffrey Walburn, the hotel’s security manager, as being ‘made up with a layer of steel frame and I suppose the best way to describe them would be similar to a compressed cardboard tiles that insulate for sound and temperature and they sit within the frame’. The offenders intended, once they were secreted within the false ceiling, to crawl along until they were above the strongroom. Safes were located in the strongroom. They intended to wait until sometime after 8.30 am on the following day, when staff would attend to business as usual and the hotel safes would be opened. As police understood the plan, the offenders would then drop from the ceiling and commit the armed robbery. 8    A police operation was planned in response to the information received about the plan by Taousanis and Massih to rob the hotel. The planning of Operation Hilton, as it became known, fell into several phases. After the Armed Hold-Up Squad received the initial information, they called for assistance from the newly formed State Protection Group (the SPG), which was responsible for the tactical planning of the operation, including any confrontation with or arrest of the offenders. Once the offenders were arrested, the SPG’s role would end, and the Armed Hold-Up Squad would take over the process of interviewing the offenders. 9    The appellants’ instructions with respect to the operation were that they were to run the listening post, located on the same floor as the strongroom, but out of line of sight. The appellants were directed that the operation would be completed under the control of the SPG and that they were to ‘take no active part whatsoever in any confrontation with the offenders’. Superintendent Harding’s evidence was that Assistant Commissioner Gibson had directed that any confrontation with the offenders was to be carried out by properly equipped members of the SPG. Harding indicated that members of the SPG would be in a position to supply support and protection for the appellants. The appellants were not given any specific instructions on what course of action they should take if the offenders left the ceiling space prior to the planned commencement of the tactical operation by the SPG, that is, prior to the arrival of SPG officers at the hotel.10    The operation was complicated by the close proximity in the hotel of Juliana’s nightclub to the robbery target, the strongroom. The entrance to the nightclub was situated ‘next to the room the police were using [as a listening post] and … virtually behind that room’. On the night in question there was a private function for about 200 people in the nightclub, which was not expected to end until about 3 am. A hotel security officer was to be posted on the door of the nightclub so that when patrons were leaving, they were directed out through the fire exit so as to avoid the lobby area of the hotel. These arrangements were in place from about 11.30 pm or midnight onwards on the night.  
     11    The protection of the public was clearly considered to be a major consideration in the development of the tactical plan. The Operational Orders (prepared by the SPG) did not expressly specify any time frame for the apprehension of the would-be offenders. However, time constraints were imposed by external factors, including the operation of the nightclub and the availability of SPG personnel. The timing of the tactical plan was described at the trial by Detective Inspector Hazzard, who was in charge of the operation, as follows:  
      
       
        
        … some time after 3 o’clock on the Sunday morning, which would be after … Juliana’s… was closed… we would secure the area by placing a perimeter around it, and ensure that the premises were evacuated from anyone not involved in the operation, and we would make contact with the offenders… and request them to surrender. And, if they failed to do so, we would use other resources to flush them from their position.  
        
       
       
        
       
     12    A number of other internal police reports noted that the operation was not expected to take place until between 3.30 and 5.30 am, when there would be no danger to members of the public.13    Her Honour found that there was no direction contained in the plan that members of the SPG were to be present in the listening post or at the hotel at any time prior to the planned start of the tactical operation. It was nonetheless directed by Gibson that any confrontation with the offenders was to be handled by the SPG, and that the group should be in a position to provide support and protection to the appellants. However, it must be emphasised that the plan itself did not involve locating any SPG members at the hotel prior to the planned start time of the tactical operation which, as has been observed, was not scheduled to commence before the closure of the nightclub at approximately 3 am. 14    There were thirty members of the SPG whose task it was to perform the operation. The supervisor for the shift which finished at 11 pm, Sergeant Magnus, wanted those men to stay on for the 11 pm to 7 am shift. There were only six men and a supervisor assigned to the 11 pm to 7 am shift and Magnus was concerned that if the Hilton operation ‘went down’ during that time frame, the group would be left undermanned. Hazzard disagreed with Magnus. Accordingly, the plan was to call out the on-call SPG members from their homes early on the morning in question. The outcome of this decision was that there was a greatly reduced number of SPG members available at the police headquarters in the Remington Centre in Liverpool Street during the night. Magnus alerted Hazzard to the risks if it happened that the tactical aspect of the operation commenced earlier than anticipated. What is important, however, is that there was no provision in the plan for the appellants to be evacuated from the listening post or to be under the protection of the SPG while at their post in the hotel. 15    In these circumstances, it is very difficult to comprehend how the SPG could provide any real protection for the appellants if the would-be robbers commenced their action earlier than 3 am. As mentioned, the three appellants were stationed in their listening post on level 7 of the hotel. Technicians had earlier placed listening devices within the false ceiling where the offenders were planning to gain entry. The listening post was located in the hotel’s ticket office, and the appellants entered the post and began monitoring at about 10.30 pm on 21 July 1991. At 1.05 am on the morning of the 22 July 1991, the appellants detected sounds of movement in the ceiling. Shepherd then telephoned the contact officer (Detective Sergeant Jenkins) at the SPG and reported this. He continued to make periodic reports thereafter as the monitors relayed sounds of the offenders crawling along the false ceiling. 16    At approximately 2.15 am, an alarm sounded within the hotel. A report of the incident later prepared by police states that ‘It appears that the offender/s fell through the fragile ceiling and set off the alarm…’. In response to the alarm, the appellants McDonald and Wilson ran from the listening post towards where the offenders were thought to be hiding. At trial both McDonald and Wilson suggested that they had left the listening post without having been certain that the alarm had been triggered by the offenders. Wilson’s written report in August 1991 conceded that both he and McDonald had ‘commenced to search for the offenders’ after leaving the listening post, although at the hearing they said that, as well as being concerned about the escape of the offenders, they feared for the safety of the public. 17    Wilson described the events which occurred after he and McDonald left the listening post: 
      
       
        
         … We made a search. I made a search of the corridor, the stairwell…I continued back down the corridor in a northerly direction and as I did so I passed Detective McDonald. He said something to me and then I heard him say, “Police, where are you going?” I turned to my left and I saw Jim Taousanis standing adjacent to the … strong room door…. 
         
        As I looked at him he raised his right arm with a revolver in it and as he did so I had my gun at my side and I realised that I wasn’t going to be able to shoot him before he shot me so I dived forward to my right and as I did he fired a number of shots. I landed on the floor… There was more shooting going on. As I hit the floor my gun was knocked out of my hand. 
         
        I tried to get my gun back. I tried to get to my feet, expecting to be shot in the back of the head because I thought Detective McDonald was dead… 
         
        I was face down. I got to the end of the corridor. I saw Detective Shepherd standing adjacent to the [listening post] door.’  
        
       
     18    Upon hearing the alarm, Shepherd telephoned Jenkins at the SPG. He did not immediately follow his two colleagues out of the listening post. Before he completed the call he heard McDonald shout ‘Police: Where are you going?’ He then heard gunfire. At this point he picked up his gun and ran from the listening post. As he left the room he saw Taousanis near the door to the fire escape, at which point Taousanis fired a shot at Shepherd. The shot narrowly passed his left ear. He dived back into the doorway of the listening post, by which time he observed Wilson on his stomach on the floor, and McDonald crouched to the right-hand side of the hallway wall. At that stage Shepherd did not know whether or not his colleagues were alive. When Shepherd stepped out again Taousanis had disappeared. Massih, however, was still present and fired at him from near the fire stair door, a distance of about 20 to 30 metres. Shepherd was able to return fire three times as Massih escaped through the fire stair door. 19    When the shooting had ceased, Shepherd saw that McDonald had been shot in the arm. After a search of the area, the three officers concluded that the offenders had escaped down the stairs and out through Pitt Street. They called for assistance. The offenders were arrested later that day by other police. 20    The appellants allege that the respondent was negligent in a number of respects. In failing to adhere to the original operational plan, and in failing to warn the appellants of the departure from the plan. More specifically, particular of negligence (e) provided: 
      
       
        
        … if, as the plaintiff does not concede, the operational plan did not provide as set out hereunder, failure of the operational plan to require, and of the NSW police service to put into effect, that heavily armed state protection group members  
        evacuate and replace 
         the plaintiff[s] … immediately after sounds of the armed offenders were first detected. [Emphasis added] 
        
       
     21    The appellants seek damages for nervous shock and psychiatric injury, and in the case of McDonald, his physical injury as well. The appellants were jointly represented at both the trial and the appeal, and their cases were heard together. Apart from differences in injuries and damages claimed, their cases are pleaded identically. 
      
       
      The Judgment at first instance 
     22    Gibb DCJ found that there was no failure by the respondent to adhere to the operational plan, no decision not to follow the plan, nor any departure from the plan. Her Honour noted that s 201 of the Police Service Act 1990 expressly required police officers to comply with lawful orders. All three appellants were experienced officers who were aware of the offenders’ dangerous nature and received explicit instructions not to engage with the offenders. However, this did not make it reasonably foreseeable that the appellants would fail to comply with their instructions. 23    Her Honour did not consider the general adequacy of the planning of Operation Hilton, although she noted that it failed. Accepting the benefit of hindsight, the plan was plainly inadequate. It is implicit in her Honour’s findings that the plan was deficient in that it made no provision as to what was to happen if the offenders left the ceiling space prior to the proposed time of the operation. This was clearly a significant omission. In these circumstances, it made no provision for the protection of the appellants, even if they remained at their post. Her Honour accepted the view that the safety of the public was central to the planning and execution of any operation. Hazzard’s testimony to the effect that having heavily armed SPG officers in the hotel prior to the time of confrontation would increase the danger to members of the public was accepted by her Honour.  
     24    Judge Gibb also found that Gibson did not direct that any SPG members should be present at the hotel prior to the start of the tactical operation, that he had ordered that any confrontation which occurred was to be handled by the SPG, and that the group should be in a position to supply support and protection for the appellants. The tactical phase of the operation, she held, was not scheduled to start prior to the closure of Juliana’s nightclub at around 3 am. However, it needs to be emphasised that there was no provision in the plan whereby the SPG could supply support and protection for the appellants prior to 3 am if the need arose. 
     25    Counsel for the appellants at trial submitted that once the alarm sounded, his clients were under a duty to respond to the situation. Her Honour accepted this to be so, however she also found that they were duty-bound to obey their instructions, which were to avoid confrontation. It was held that the appellants were not under a duty to pursue or try to arrest the offenders, and that there was no departure from the operational plan which required the appellants to engage the offenders. Her Honour further held that there can be no duty to warn of the dangers of a course of action where the appellants were expressly told not to embark upon such a course. 26    At trial, there was also an allegation of negligence in respect of the non-supply of protective vests and shotguns. This rested upon the allegation that the respondent departed from the operational plan. Her Honour held that there was no departure from the plan by the respondent. There had been a change in the philosophy of the police service with respect to entitlement to carry specialised weapons (high powered) which had occurred with the establishment of the SPG. It was never part of the plan that the appellants carry shotguns as a part of the operation. In any event, it was found that the presence of shotguns would have made no difference in the outcome of the confrontation with the offenders. In both cases the offenders fired first. The plan did not call for the appellants to be supplied with protective vests. They were, however, available through the Armed Hold-Up Squad, yet the appellants did not take advantage of this. Finally, vests would have made no difference to the outcome, as McDonald was shot in the arm. No appeal was brought against these findings.27    At first instance, the appellants also claimed that the respondent should have evacuated the appellants from the listening post. Hazzard had considered such a possibility but discounted it in order to avoid any action commencing while Juliana’s nightclub was still in operation. No evidence was presented as to how a successful evacuation and replacement of the appellants could have been carried out without alerting the offenders and thereby endangering members of the public. 28    Her Honour also said that she accepted the reports by Shepherd and Wilson written in August 1991. However, she found their oral testimony to be contradictory in parts and attempts by them to explain their revised version of the events unsatisfactory. Her Honour held that the appellants had failed to discharge their onus with respect to the allegations of negligence or of any breach of duty by the respondent.  
      
      Submissions on Appeal 
     29    The case at trial was that the SPG should have arrived as soon as possible after the notification at 1.05 am by the appellants that the offenders were in the ceiling. The appellants’ submissions on appeal came down to, in effect, two grounds of appeal.30    The first submission on behalf of the appellants was that ‘on any view of the evidence it was part of the plan that at least two State Protection Group Officers would come to the listening post and protect the [appellants]… and… evacuate or replace them’. The appellants’ submission focuses upon what they regard as being necessary for their protection. It was contended that the provision of two or three SPG officers who, being out of uniform, would ‘surreptitiously and covertly’ enter the listening post and either remain there to protect the appellants, or allow for their evacuation, was reasonable and necessary. These SPG officers would then remain in the listening post, where they would be able to respond to any adverse contingency, including the collapse of the false ceiling whilst the offenders were in it, which was submitted as being foreseeable. It was contended that either the evacuation or protection of the appellants was both ‘feasible and reasonable’, as the listening post was located in a hotel where the movement of people in and out of doors and in the nearby lobby occurs at various times without raising any suspicion. 31    The second submission of the appellants, being one on which they failed at trial, was that the containment and arrest of the offenders should have been commenced by the SPG as soon as possible after 1.05 am. It was put to the Court that although the role of the SPG was containment and arrest of the offenders, this allocation of responsibility was no longer pertinent in the absence of the SPG. There was no provision in the plan for the protection of the appellants from adverse contingencies which had the potential to generate conflict with the offenders. It follows that the directions given to the appellants, that they were to remain in the listening post, had no application to the foreseeable situation for which no provision was made in the planning of the operation. 32    The respondent submitted that the appellants had clear orders, which they were obliged to follow. They should not have left the listening post in any circumstance.  
     33    It was submitted that those planning the operation saw it as appropriate that the SPG be located in the Remington Centre, which was stated to be only two to three minutes away from the hotel, as opposed to being located within the hotel itself. There was a reduced number of SPG members on duty at the Remington Centre at the time the confrontation of the appellants with the offenders took place. The remainder of the group involved in the operation were at home, waiting to be called out closer to the planned time of confrontation, which was envisaged to be between 3.30 and 5.30 am.34    It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was ample evidence to support the conclusions of her Honour and where there was any conflict in the evidence, it was open to her Honour to prefer the evidence that supported her conclusion. 
      
      The pleading point 
     35    On appeal, counsel for the appellants argued that the respondent was under a duty to ‘evacuate, replace or protect’ the appellants. The particulars of negligence in the Statements of Claim filed by the appellants read that ‘heavily armed state protection group members evacuate and replace the [appellants] immediately after sounds of the armed offenders were first detected’. (emphasis added) The argument with respect to negligence on appeal therefore departs from that which was particularised at trial. 
     36    Although Mr Cowan, counsel for the respondent, did not protest at the inclusion of a duty to protect the appellants being relied on by the appellants during oral argument, he was later instructed to rely upon the point and forwarded a letter to that effect to the Court. 37    In response to the notification that the respondent sought to rely upon the pleading point, Mr Gross QC, appearing on behalf of the appellants, caused a Notice of Motion to be filed seeking leave to amend the Particulars of Negligence in each Statement of Claim, so as to substitute ‘evacuate, replace or protect’ in lieu of ‘evacuate and replace’. 38    The inclusion of the failure of the respondent to ensure the protection of the appellants, as a particular of negligence, does not prejudice the respondents. Indeed, the respondent’s submissions on this point make no mention of prejudice. A duty to protect the appellants is an extension of the duty to evacuate them. At trial, the evidence presented which was relevant to a duty to evacuate the appellants was also relevant to a duty to protect them. Indeed, on one view of the matter, there may be no need to amend the particulars of negligence in the Statements of Claim. As I have said, it is not apparent that the respondent is prejudiced by the slightly different way in which the case is now put. The evidence which was required to address the issue was called before the Court at the trial. It was covered also in submissions made to the District Court and particular (e) was treated as if it included ‘protection’. In any event, it must be kept in mind that these are but particulars of negligence. See Katsilis v Broken Hill Co Pty Ltd (1977) 18 ALR 181 at 206 – 207 referring to Mummery v Irvings Pty Ltd (1956) 96 CLR 99 at 110.39    Accordingly, although it may strictly be unnecessary, the Court should grant the amendment sought. 
      
       
      Consideration 
       
     40    As I have said, the operational plan was fundamentally deficient. It made no allowance for the obviously foreseeable possibility that the ‘action’ as the hotel might well commence prior to 3 am. It was conceivable that the offenders would decide to descend from the confined ceiling space earlier than the time which police believed they intended. It should have also been appreciated, bearing in mind the fragile nature of the false ceiling, that the offenders might fall through and that this could occur at any time after they crawled into the space, which occurred at around 1 am. 
     41    It was conceded on the evidence that Assistant Commissioner Gibson had envisaged that the SPG would provide protection for the appellants. Notwithstanding, the plan made absolutely no provision for any protection for the appellants if, for whatever reason, the offenders descended from the ceiling prior to 3 am. 
     42    Not only did this grave deficiency in the plan have potential consequences for the appellants, even if they remained in the listening room, it also potentially put at risk the lives of members of the public. Those who planned the operation could not seriously have believed that if the offenders, known to be armed and highly dangerous, descended into the hotel prior to 3 am, when up to 200 people were at the nightclub, that there was no possibility of a confrontation. It must have been expected that the appellants would, if such an event occurred (as it did), leave their post, if for no other reason than to seek to protect members of the public. This would be an almost inevitable outcome notwithstanding their firm instructions not to engage the offenders. In this regard, it is hardly ‘mystifying’ that the appellants left their post, as her Honour observed. 
     43    In any event, I would have thought that the appellants’ duty was clear, particularly if they reasonably apprehended danger to the public. That duty was to leave their post and endeavour to protect any members of the public in the vicinity of the offenders. This would have been their overriding duty notwithstanding their orders. One wonders what might have been the situation if the offenders had shot any member of the public after they fell through the false ceiling and it became known that three armed police officers were secreted in a room close by but that they remained there and did not seek to protect the public or apprehend the offenders. 
     44    The failure of the plan to provide for such a contingency, as in fact occurred, and one which was readily foreseeable, placed the appellants at great risk. It also placed the public at risk.  
     45    The nature of the duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to members of the police service was discussed in State of NSW v Seedsman [2000] NSWCA 119 (Unreported, NSWCA, 12 May 2000). The respondent had suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of being involved in a number of investigations into violence against children. There had been no adequate support system or training in place to address the stresses imposed upon individuals exposed to such experiences. 
     46    Mason P stated that: 
      
       
        
        The employment relationship is one of the settled categories where a duty of care has never been in issue. So clear is the duty that it is non-delegable. In  
        Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee  
        (1999) 74 ALJR 1 Hayne J said (at [276]) (citation omitted): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The common law imposes a duty on the employer because the employer is in a position to direct another to go in harm’s way and to do so in circumstances over which that employer can exercise control. The duty is, of course, not absolute: it is the duty “of a reasonably prudent employer and it is a duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing the employees to unnecessary risks of injury”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The duty “ 
        extends to taking reasonable steps in accident prevention and not waiting for accidents to happen before safeguarding the health and safety of employees” 
         ( 
        Schellenberg v Tunnel Holdings Pty Ltd  
        [2000] HCA 18 at [101] per Kirby J). [paras 162 – 163] 
        
       
     47    Spigelman CJ noted that: 
      
       
        
        The laws of negligence is concerned with human beings. It is not concerned with specific occupations. [para 60] 
        
       
     48    It is clear that the duty of care owed by the State of New South Wales to police officers is in no way distinguishable from that owed by any other employer to its employees. 
     49    There was a clear breach of the duty of care owed by the respondent to the appellants. It was the breach of duty which caused the injury and the respondent does not contest her Honour’s finding that the conduct of the appellants (in leaving their post) did not constitute a novus actus interveniens. It was not only necessary to provide protection for the appellants, as Gibson proposed and Harding accepted, but it was feasible to do so. Two or three SPG members could have been sent to the hotel, in civilian clothes, to provide protection for the appellants in the listening post. Notwithstanding Hazzard’s concerns, I am unable to appreciate that this could not have been done and advised without alerting the offenders. 
     50    One might be pardoned for concluding that it was open on the evidence to find that the reason that the plan did not provide any SPG officers to protect the appellants prior to 3 am, was in the interests of economy. It seems somewhat strange that so few members of the SPG were available at the Remington Centre at 1.05 am when the offenders were located in the ceiling and that it would have been necessary to call the balance of the officers from their homes (and beds) so that the operation could proceed later in the morning as planned. 
     51    Notwithstanding the above conclusions as to breach of duty, it must be said that on one analysis of the Operational Orders themselves, the respondent was in breach. The Orders provided that ‘on the confirmation that the offenders have secreted themselves in the false ceiling, Operations Unit personnel and Armed Hold-Up Squad personnel will form a perimeter and contain the offenders to the seventh level’. However, when the offenders’ presence in the ceiling was confirmed to the SPG at 1.05 am, there were no SPG officers available at the hotel or determined to be sent there until at least 3.30 am. Further, it was anticipated that when this phase of the operation occurred, thirty SPG members would be needed. Such numbers would not be available until much later in the morning for reasons already mentioned. 
     52    Accordingly, it is my opinion that the appeals should be allowed. The judgments entered for the respondent should be set aside and a finding in favour of the appellants be made on the issue of liability. The matters need to be remitted to the District Court for the assessment of damages. 
      
       
      Orders 
       
     53    I propose the following orders: 
      
       
      1. Appeals allowed with costs. 
       
       
      2. Judgment and orders in favour of the respondent be set aside. 
       
       
      3. Judgment on the issue of liability in favour of the appellants be substituted therefor. 
       
       
      4. The respondent be ordered to pay the appellants’ costs in the Court below. 
       
       
      5. Remitted to the District Court to assess the appellants’ damages.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONWednesday 12 September 2001SPERLING J70061/99 Regina v Debbie Marie AdamsJudgment1    The accused, Debbie Marie Adams, stands charged that she -  
     
      
       
        
         
         (1) on or about 25 January 1999, at Warilla in the State of New South Wales, did maliciously wound Dianne Adams, with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Dianne Adams. 
         
        
        
         
         (2) on 23 July 1999, at Haberfield in the State of New South Wales, did murder Scott Bremner. 
         
        
       
      
    2    The accused was born on 11 August 1982. On 25 January 1999, she was 16 years of age. On 23 July 1999, she was not yet 17 years of age. 
     
      
       
      
    3    Dianne Adams is the accused’s mother. On 26 January 1999, the accused was taken into custody. She was detained at Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre. There, she attended the Sunning Hill school. Scott Bremner was a TAFE employee who worked in the school. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The first charge was initially one of attempt murder. It was later amended to malicious wounding. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The accused was arraigned before this court in relation to both matters. On 13 November 2000, Dunford J determined that the accused was unfit to be tried, pursuant to s 11A of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. 
     
      
       
      
    6    On 30 March 2001, the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined, pursuant to s 16(1), that the accused would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the alleged offences. On 11 May 2001, the Attorney General, pursuant to s 18, ordered that a special hearing be conducted. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 relating to a special hearing are as follows, so far as is presently relevant. 
     
      
       
        
         
         19(1) If the Attorney General directs that a special hearing be conducted in respect of an offence with which a person is charged, the appropriate Court must, as soon as practicable after the Attorney General so directs, conduct a special hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.  
         
        
        
         
         21. (1) Except as provided by this Act, a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings. 
          
         (2) . . . . . 
          
         (3) At a special hearing:  
          
           
           (a) the accused person is to be taken to have pleaded not guilty in respect of the offence charged; and  
            
           (b) . . . . . 
            
           (c) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person may raise any defence that could be properly raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings; and 
           
          
         (4) . . . . .  
         
        
        
         
         21A(1) At a special hearing, the question whether an accused person has committed an offence charged or any offence available as an alternative to an offence charged is to be determined by the Judge alone if the person so elects in accordance with this section and the Judge is satisfied that the person, before making the election, sought and received advice in relation to the election from a barrister or solicitor. 
          
         (2) An election may be made only with the consent of the prosecutor. 
          
         (3) An election must be made before the date fixed for the person’s special hearing in the Supreme Court or District Court. 
          
         (4) An accused person who elects to have a special hearing determined by the Judge alone may, at any time before the date fixed for the person’s special hearing, subsequently elect to have the matter determine by a jury. 
          
         (5) Rules of court may be made with respect to elections under this section. 
         
        
        
         
         21B. (1) The verdicts available to a Judge who determines a special hearing without a jury are the verdicts available to a jury under section 22. Any such verdict has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
          
         (2) A determination by a Judge in any such special hearing must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. 
         
        
        
         
         22. (1) The verdicts available to the jury or the Court at a special hearing include the following:  
          
           
           (a) not guilty of the offence charged;  
            
           (b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness;  
            
           (c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged;  
            
           (d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.  
           
          
         (2) . . . . . 
          
         (3) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1) (c) or (d):  
          
           
           (a) constitutes a qualified finding of guilt and does not constitute a basis in law for any conviction for the offence to which the finding relates; and  
            
           (b) subject to section 28, constitutes a bar to further prosecution in respect of the same circumstances; and  
            
           (c) . . . . . 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    8    The special hearing was conducted before me without a jury, the provisions of s 21A having been complied with. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The special hearing commenced on 24 July 2001 and concluded (subject to limited written submissions and possible further evidence) on 31 July 2001. At the hearing Mr T Hoyle SC, appeared for the Crown. Mr G Turnbull appeared for the accused. I was informed by the Crown that further short evidence would be called. That was done on 31 August 2001. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The court was informed, at the commencement of the hearing, that there was no objection to the two charges being heard and determined concurrently. 
     
      
       
      
    11    In each case, the actus reus was admitted by counsel on behalf of the accused. That was, in each case, stabbing with a knife. 
     
      
       
      
    12    In relation to the second charge the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind was raised pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         23A(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if: 
          
           
           (a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person’s capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person’s actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and 
            
           (b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
           
          
         (2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible. 
          
         (3) . . . . . 
          
         (4) The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section. 
          
         (5) A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead. 
          
         (6) . . . . . 
          
         (7) . . . . . 
          
         (8) In this section: underlying condition means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind. 
         
        
       
      
    13    A defence of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 was not raised. Under the principles that apply and on the evidence of the psychiatrists given at the hearing, no such defence was available. 
     
      
       
      
    14    A notified defence of automatism was not pressed. That too was an appropriate decision. The defence was not sustainable on the evidence. 
     
      
       
        
       The First Charge 
        
       
      
    15    I apply the following legal principles in relation to the first charge. The crime of maliciously wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm (Crimes Act 1900, s 33), as charged, consists of the following elements or ingredients, all of which must be found to be the fact beyond reasonable doubt for the accused to be convicted of that crime in this case: that the accused wounded the victim; maliciously; and with intent to do grievous bodily harm to the victim. “Maliciously” comprehends (so far as is necessary for present purposes) an act done with intent to injure and without lawful cause or excuse: s 5. (No issue was raised as to lawful cause or excuse.) “Wound”, for present purposes, has its ordinary meaning. “Grievous bodily harm” means really serious injury. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The evidence in relation to this count consisted of witness statements by the following persons:

       (d) Dianne Adams, the accused’s mother. 
        
        
       (e) Ian Parks, de facto partner of the accused’s mother and resident with her at the time of the incident.

       (l) June Grindle, neighbour of the accused’s mother at the time of the incident. 
        
        
       (m) Tony Grindle, husband of June Grindle and resident with her at the time of the incident. 
        
        
       (n) Shelley Bailey, neighbour of the accused’s mother at the time of the incident. 
        
        
       (o) Sergeant Dennis Hughes, one of the police officers called to the scene on 25 January 1999. 
        
        
       (p) Senior Constable Robert Gonzalez, one of the police officers called to the scene on 25 January 1999. 
        
        
       (q) Adam Sawyer, the young man approached by the accused at Wollongong railway station on 26 January 1999 after the incident on 25 January 1999. 
        
        
       (r) Constable Glenn Cairns, one of the police officers who attended Wollongong railway station on 26 January 1999. 
        
        
       (s) Sergeant Patrick O’Brien, one of the police officers who attended Wollongong railway station on 26 January 1999. 
        
        
       (t) Detective Sergeant Robert Harbin, a police officer who spoke to the accused’s mother, Terrie Adams, Kellie Adams and Ian Parks on 26 January 1999. This includes a transcript of the record of interview. 
        
        
       (u) Authority to take hair / blood from the accused, 26 January 1999. 
        
        
       (v) Doctor Ron Bezic, medical practitioner who attended the accused’s mother on 26 January 1999. This is an expert certificate under s 177 of the  
       Evidence Act 
        1995. 
        
       
      
    17    None of these witnesses was required to give oral evidence or to attend for cross examination. The facts relating to the first charge are not in dispute. The following statement of facts appears in Exhibit D, a written submission document submitted by the Crown. 
     
      
       
        
         
         At about 10.30pm on 25 January 1999 the accused who was then aged 16 years and a ward of the state left the home of her cares [ 
         sic 
         ] situated at 11 Shellharbour Road, Dunmore and travelled to her natural mother’s home at 3 Bradman Street, Warilla. 
         
        
        
         
         She took with her a bread knife belonging to her carers. 
         
        
        
         
         At about 11.45pm the accused forced her way into her mother’s house and started swinging the knife towards Ian Parks, her mother’s current de facto. He fled the house. 
         
        
        
         
         Her mother then sat on the lounge. The accused swung the knife at her mother whilst saying, “Do you really want me to kill you”. She then placed the knife under her mothers arm, giving it a little push whilst saying, “When do you want me to stab you?” The accused then said, “I am going to kill you before the police and welfare get to me”. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused then started to walk into the kitchen. Her mother ran outside chased by the accused who was screaming, “I’m gonna kill ya, I’m gonna kill ya”. 
         
        
        
         
         Her mother felt a sharp pain in the side of her neck. She was able to run to a neighbour’s house where she obtained help. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused made her way to Wollongong Railway Station where she approached and introduced herself to Adam Sawyer (18 years old) as Melanie. She told Sawyer, “I’m on the run from the police... because I stabbed my mum in the back twice... I have wanted to do it for a long time due to being abused when I was younger by my mother and her boyfriend...” 
         
        
        
         
         The accused showed the knife to Sawyer. He noted that there was blood on the blade. She put the knife away and Sawyer asked her where it had happened. The accused said, “At her place at Warilla... I hope I killed the bitch or if I didn’t I will go back and try to stab her until she is dead...” 
         
        
        
         
         Sawyer left the railway station and contacted police. A short time later police attended the station where they apprehended the accused. She was taken to Warilla Police Station where she was interviewed in the presence of her carers and an Aboriginal Community Liaison officer. She denied being at her mother’s house and denied any knowledge of the knife that was found in her possession when arrested. 
         
        
        
         
         Her mother received a superficial laceration over the side of her right Scapula. The wound was sutured and she was allowed to return home. 
         
        
       
      
    18    Having regard to the evidence before me, I find those facts. 
     
      
       
      
    19    I find, on the limited evidence available, that the accused committed the offence in the first charge. 
     
      
       
        
       The Second Charge 
        
       
      
    20    I apply the following legal principles in relation to the second charge. The crime of murder has been committed by the accused if the Crown has established, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was the act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased and that that act was done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. “Grievous bodily harm” means really serious physical injury. 
     
      
       
      
    21    If the Crown has established those matters beyond reasonable doubt, the accused has committed the crime of murder unless she has established the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, in which case, the crime of murder is reduced to manslaughter. The partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind is successful if the accused has established (a) that more probably than not, at the time of her act causing the death of the deceased, her capacity to understand events or to judge whether her actions were right or wrong or to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and (b) that such impairment was so substantial as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. An abnormality of mind occurs if the accused’s capacity to function in any of those ways deviates from the normal range of variation in how people so function. It is not sufficient if the condition is merely transitory, but it does not have to be a permanent condition. 
     
      
       
      
    22    The evidence in relation to this count consisted of witness statements by the following persons, some of whom also gave oral evidence. 
     
      
       
        
       (a) Plain Clothes Constable Todd Pickering (inc. ERISP), one of the police officers called to the scene on 23 July 1999. He also gave oral evidence. He also gave evidence in relation to the unavailability of several other witnesses. 
        
        
       (b) Detective Senior Constable (now Acting Inspector) Paul Birch, one of the police officers called to the scene on 23 July 1999. He also gave oral evidence. 
        
        
       (c) Karen Holmes, a teacher at Sunning Hill School for Specific Purposes situated at Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre, who was present in the classroom when the incident occurred on 23 July 1999. There was evidence explaining why this witness could not be called to give oral evidence. 
        
        
       (d) Karen Horsley, a teacher’s aide at Sunning Hill, who was present in the classroom when the incident occurred on 23 July 1999. She also gave oral evidence. 
        
        
       (e) Nicole Zarglis, a detainee at Yasmar at the time of the incident, who was present in the classroom when the incident occurred on 23 July 1999. There was evidence explaining why this witness could not be called to give oral evidence.

    24    Counsel for the accused tendered, without objection, medical reports by Dr Sara Williams (six reports), Dr Steve Hartman (four reports) and Dr J. D. G. Watson.

    25    Some of this material went to the defence of substantial impairment. A good deal of it went to issues which would arise if a finding were made that the accused committed the offences charged or an alternative offence. It was convenient and sensible to tender the evidence in this way without regard to that distinction. 
     
      
       
      
    26    The basic facts relating to the second charge are not in dispute. The following statement of facts appears in Exhibit D, a Crown submission document. 
     
      
       
        
         
         After being charged with the offence relating to her mother, the accused was placed into custody at Yasmar Detention Centre. On 23rd July 1999 she attended a TAFE cooking class held at Yasmar. During the class she was seen by a number of other attendees to take a large kitchen knife and stab the course teacher, Scott Bremner, in the back. Mr Bremner died later that day during surgery at RPA Hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused was arrested by police but, upon advice, declined to be interviewed. 
         
        
        
       On the evidence before me, I find those facts. 
        
       
      
    27    A fuller statement of facts appears in a written outline of argument submitted by the Crown. It was not disputed by counsel for the accused. 
     
      
       
        
         
         1. On Friday 23rd July 1999 the accused was one of six detainees enrolled in a cooking class held at the Sunning Hill Education and Training Centre that is located within the grounds of the Yasmar Juvenile Justice Centre at Haberfield. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The cooking class was conducted by employees of the Department of Education and Training. The deceased was employed as a storeman with TAFE and was present that morning to assist with the class. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Each detainee was given a toolbox that contained a knife. The accused was noted to become very excited and hyper active when handed her knife. At recess she made a comment to the assistant principle (Gerard Hughes [ 
         sic 
          for Adam Hughes]) that she was going to stab him whilst at the same time, making a movement with her hand simulating a stabbing motion. Around the same time she told another detainee (Rima Pacey) that she was going to stab Scott (the deceased). She also told Honora Taufahema that she was going to stab Lauren Freshwater. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Shortly after recess (about 11.20am) and whilst receiving tuition on how to cut vegetables the accused begun to walk a few paces backwards and forwards (twice) before walking about 10 paces to where the deceased was standing. The accused carried the knife in her hand that she held down beside her body with the blade pointing towards the floor. She stood behind him raised the knife in both hands to the same height as her head before bringing her hands down so that the knife penetrated into the deceased’s back. 
         
        
        
         
         5. As the accused started to move away she threw the knife in the direction of the deceased. She also threw some vegetables in the direction of the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         6. The deceased was given first aid and then conveyed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He died at 3.47pm whilst undergoing emergency surgery. 
         
        
        
         
         7. The accused was removed from the classroom and placed inside a holding room. Whilst in that room she was seen and heard to direct the following questions and statements to Tau Tuala (Youth Worker) 
         
        
       
      
    · Do you think he felt it· Do you think it hurt· Good job, eh, good job.· I only did it because the other girls told me to do it. It wasn’t even supposed to be him. It was supposed to be someone else but he was there. 
     
      
       
      
    28    On the evidence before me, I find those facts with one exception. In relation to the threat to Mr Hughes, I find that, whatever passed between the accused and Mr Hughes was said in a jocular tone. Mr Hughes did not believe there was any threat by the accused directed towards him. I do not find that any such threat was made or intended by the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    29    By way of further detail, counsel for the accused has submitted (in a supplementary written submission) that I should make certain further findings of fact relevant to the defence of substantial impairment. They are as follows. As at 25 January 1999, when the accused stabbed her mother, she was facing two separate charges of carrying a concealed weapon (knives). Whilst detained at Yasmar, she came under notice for theft of a needle, theft of a knife, having a sharp piece of wire and striking a worker with a leather-working tool. According to Ms Zarglis, another inmate, the accused got hold of sharp things, she liked sharpened sticks and had a spear in her room. According to Ms Zarglis, that the accused talked frequently of stabbing things and stabbing people, and of an intention “to finish off her mother”. According to Ms Pacey, the accused was fascinated with knives, always “talking about them and goes hypo” (which I take to mean very aroused). According to Mr Semi, the accused became “really excited” around knives and wanted to use them on someone, she also became excited about other sharpened things. Ms Tuala agreed in her evidence at the special hearing that sharp objects and knives “got her [the accused] going”. 
     
      
       
      
    30    The Crown did not oppose those additional findings, being made. On the evidence before me, I find those facts. 
     
      
       
      
    31    I find that, prior to 23 July 1999, the accused had evidenced a fascination for knives and other sharp objects and became highly aroused in relation to them. There is a substantial prior history of incidents involving violence or threat of violence directed by the accused towards others. There are 21 such incidents recorded in the DOCS file, between November 1998 and June 1999. Such instances of violence were difficult to control. Ms Phillips spoke of incidents invariably “accelerating to a point where she [the accused] had to be removed from class or remove herself”. Mr Vera-Lobos was apprehensive about the accused to be attending the cooking class on 23 July 1999 because of her history. That was the background. 
     
      
       
      
    32    It is apparent that on 23 July 1999, before going to the cooking class, the accused was in a state of high arousal, related to the opportunity to handle a knife or knives. The accused was, according to Ms Tuala, “very excited and kept asking Michael and myself about the knives in the class”. She said, “Are there any knives in the class?” and “Do I get one, do I get one?”. She asked that in an agitated fashion. 
     
      
       
      
    33    Chef’s uniforms were available at the classroom. The accused put one on. Ms Zarglis said that the accused was “really excited because she was wearing a uniform and saw the knives.” Others also spoke of the accused being excited about being in the chef’s uniform. Use of knives was to be at the end of the class session but, according to the teacher’s assistant, Ms Horsley, each student was given a box at the start of the class which contained two knives. Ms Zarglis and Ms Horsley saw the accused holding a large knife before the mid-morning break. They said she was smiling. 
     
      
       
      
    34    During recess, Mr Vera-Lobos, who was team leader of the youth workers that day, was called in because the accused was “hyped up”, “over the top”. He had seen her that way before. She was running around. She said, “You should see the knives they have given me”, indicating the size of the knives with her hands. She talked about how easy it would be to stab someone, making stabbing motions with her hands. “She kept going on about knives,” he said, until he distracted her by changing the subject. She then appeared to calm down. 
     
      
       
      
    35    Others also said that, during the recess, the accused was excited about having been given a knife and about it being a big knife. She told Ms Semi that she intended to stab another inmate, Lauren Freshwater. 
     
      
       
      
    36    After recess, the students were taken back to the classroom. Knives were sharpened, and chopping vegetables began. Ms Horsley and Ms Holmes saw the accused stabbing her knife into the chopping board and Ms Holmes told her stop that. It was shortly after that that the accused stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
       
      
    37    Immediately before the stabbing, Ms Zarglis noticed that the accused was “smiling and nodding her head up and down”. Ms Zarglis said that, when the accused had that look, “that means she will go off”. Ms Horsley also spoke of the accused “showing a funny face”, which she said was “maybe a negative look on her face like maybe she really didn’t like the look of both of us possibly”. There was apparently something strange about the accused’s demeanour which the witnesses had difficulty describing. 
     
      
       
      
    38    It was then that the accused walked behind the deceased, holding the knife by her side, and stabbed him in the back. 
     
      
       
      
    39    Following the stabbing the accused attacked a cardboard box containing vegetables and threw the vegetables. She had to be forcibly restrained. 
     
      
       
      
    40    I find on the evidence, that the accused had a pathological fascination for knives. I find that, on the day of the stabbing and at the time of the stabbing of the deceased, the accused was in a highly aroused state, initiated by access to and the handling of a large kitchen knife or knives. 
     
      
       
      
    41    I find that, absent the partial defence of substantial impairment, the charge of murder would be established. 
     
      
       
      
    42    The psychiatric evidence was uniformly supportive of the defence of substantial impairment, on the ground that, at the time of her act, the accused’s capacity to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. The psychiatrists did not support the defence on the ground of impairment of capacity to understand events or on the ground of the accused’s capacity to judge whether her actions were right or wrong. 
     
      
       
      
    43    The psychiatric evidence was as follows. Dr B Westmore was retained by the Crown initially on the question of unfitness to be tried and subsequently in relation to potential defences to the charge of murder. He interviewed the accused on 11 August 1999 (reports 12 August 1999 and 16 November 1999), on 16 October 2000 (report 19 October 2000) and on 20 February 2001 (report 23 July 2001). The interview on 11 August 1999 had to be terminated part way through when the accused struck the doctor on the head, spontaneously and unprovoked. The doctor’s opinion in August 1999 - perhaps validly influenced by personal experience - was that the accused was “severely disturbed psychologically” and “extremely dangerous”. Dr Westmore concluded his report of 23 July 2001 as follows. 
     
      
       
        
         
         As you can see from this report and my previous documents, Ms Adams is an extremely disturbed person psychologically. She is intellectually disadvantaged I believe but suggesting to what degree is difficult on the contact I have had with her, Behaviourally she is extremely disturbed and it is possible, indeed probable, that she has a psychotic illness. 
          
         . . . . . 
         
        
        
         
         It is likely this young person has an extreme personality disorder along with the other problems of intellectual disadvantage, social immaturity and a possible psychotic illness. 
         
        
        
         
         With regard to the availability of psychiatric defences, or otherwise, to the charge of murder, I am unable to find any clear evidence to support a mental illness defence. That is, while she may be showing signs of mental illness at this time, I can find no direct or positive relationship between those possible psychotic disturbances and the stabbing of the man Scott. 
         
        
        
         
         She does however, in my view, qualify for consideration for the defence of substantial impairment. This young woman suffers an abnormality of mind (a severe personality disorder). In my opinion the abnormality of mind would have, on the balance of probabilities, substantially impaired her capacity to control her actions on the day she stabbed the man Scott.

         Q. In that regard you’re of the view she suffered from an abnormality of the mind? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
         Q. Is it possible, in your opinion, to qualify that or quantify it in terms of mild, modern or severe? 
          
         A. She has an extreme severe personality disorder, I think of a borderline type with some antisocial properties to it. It is a severe disorder that she has.

         Q. Is it fair to say that on 23 July, when one looks at the events and the context within which she found herself, that there is certainly a suggestion that she would have been more than likely in an acute state of arousal, would you agree? 
          
         A. Yes, probable, yes. 
          
         Q. As a result, given the context which created the arousal, her severe personality disorder, you were of the clear view that her ability to control herself in those circumstances was substantially impaired? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
       Transcript at 186: 
        
        
         
         Q. Therefore I ask you: what effect on the abnormality of mind that you have been speaking of might there have been in July of 1999, from her age and her sexual maturation, any effect or effect or no effect? 
          
         A. Because her behavioural disturbances are so extreme, and although it is out of the usual to make a diagnosis at such a young age - she was 16 I think when the incident occurred - I believe it is valid to make the diagnosis in this case because the characteristics she displayed and the disturbances she displayed are so clearly defined, there is very little vagueness about them, and I feel safe making the diagnosis, and I think the personality disorder which she has now was present then and it will be present for many years to come. 
         
        
        
       Transcript at 186-187: 
        
        
         
         Q. This is a case, isn’t it, where there are a variety of complex factors all having intermingling effect, such that it is very hard to chop up your diagnosis into specifically the abnormality of mind and specifically the underlying condition; is that the situation? 
          
         A. Yes. Well, the abnormality of mind arises from the underlying condition, which is the personality disorder. The abnormality of mind is reflected in her behavioural disturbances, her impulsivity, her lack of judgment, her lack of boundaries, the uncontained aggression, emotional aggression that she displays; the intense attachments, and probably associated devaluation that she would have of people, so the abnormality of mind is really a mirror arising, a mirror reflection of this personality disorder that she has. 
         
        
       
      
    45    Dr R Wilcox was retained on behalf of the accused, initially on the question of unfitness to be tried and later in relation to possible defences. She examined the accused on 19 January 2001 (report 28 February 2001), and on 16 July 2001 (reports 16 July 2001 and 25 July 2001). She concluded her report of 16 July 2001 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I do not believe that Ms Adams would satisfy the criteria for a mental illness defence. However I feel that when she stabbed the teacher she was suffering from an abnormality of the mind that occurred as a result of an underlying condition and the underlying condition was a dissociative form of post-traumatic stress disorder. As a result of this abnormality of the mind her capacity to control herself was substantially impaired. Whether the capacity was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is something for the court to decide.

         Q. You have spoken to Doctor Westmore today? 
          
         A. I have. 
          
         Q. You have heard him give evidence in relation to his findings and be cross-examined and so forth? 
          
         A. Yes I have. 
          
         Q. Doctor, in relation to the conclusion he comes to, upon which he gave evidence and was cross-examined, do you agree with the conclusions of Doctor Westmore? 
          
         A. There is nothing that Doctor Westmore said that I strongly disagree with. It was a matter of some minor things but basically we are in concordance, yes. 
          
         Q. You are of the view the accused suffers from an abnormality of mind? 
          
         A. Yes, I believe so. 
          
         Q. Your conclusion in relation that abnormality of mind is what, what is the accused suffering from? 
          
         A. Well, I similarly agree with Doctor Westmore. The abnormality of mind is a reflection of a whole degree of conditions and combinations, at least including a severe personality disturbance, delayed disability and developmental disability and a degree of post-traumatic stress disorder as well. I think it is a combination of these three factors. 
          
         Q. You have described part of the condition as being post-traumatic stress disorder, is that the case? 
          
         A. Well, I mentioned that a lot of the symptoms that I elicited from Miss Adams, from Debbie, were indicative of more complex post-traumatic stress disorder, that has been associated with people that have been the victims of abuse.

         Q. You have heard Doctor Westmore specifically indicate that in his view at the time of the commission of the act against Mr Bremner the accused, by reason of her abnormality of mind, had her ability to control herself substantially impaired, is that something with which you would agree? 
          
         A. That is something how I would perceive it myself, too. 
         
        
       
      
    47    Dr Brown, psychiatrist, was also called in the accused’s case. She has been the accused treating psychiatrist since the accused was transferred to Mulawa Correctional Centre in July 1999. The following are extracts from her evidence.

         Q. And it is the situation, isn’t it, that as the accused’s treating doctor you have formed a view as to her current condition, in terms of diagnosis? 
          
         A. Yes, I have. 
          
         Q. What is that diagnosis? 
          
         A. In concordance with Dr Westmore and Dr Wilcox, my primary diagnosis was that of a personality disorder with borderline and antisocial features, but over time I have also come to an additional diagnosis, that of either being a chronic post-traumatic stress disorder or a disassociative disorder.

         Q. You have had the opportunity to listen to both Dr Wilcox and Dr Westmore give evidence? 
          
         A. I have. 
          
         Q. And you agree with their conclusions; is that the situation? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
    48    I find that the accused’s capacity to control herself, at the time of her act, causing the death of the deceased, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, namely, severe personality disorder. I further find that such impairment was so substantial as to warrant her liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      
    49    Accordingly, I find, on the limited evidence available, that the accused committed the offence of manslaughter, being an offence available as an alternative to the offence with which she is charged. 
     
      
       
      
    50    I direct that the following verdicts be entered: 
     
      
       
        
         
         (1) On the limited evidence available, the accused did, on or about 25 January 1999, at Warilla in the state of New South Wales, commit the offence of maliciously wounding Dianne Adams with intent to do grievous bodily harm; 
         
        
        
         
         (2) On the limited evidence available, the accused did on 23 July 1999, at Haberfield in the state of New South Wales, commit the offence of manslaughter of Scott Bremner.

       Ex tempore - RevisedTHE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONCRIMINAL ADAMS J LISMORE: THURSDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 2000170081/00 - REGINA v DAVID ANDREW WRIGHTSENTENCEHIS HONOUR: On the morning of Friday 25 June 1999, Todd Serone, the 27 year old son of Colin and Peggy Serone, entered the house where his mother lived alone to find her lying dead behind a pool table on the entertainment room floor. He called police and an ambulance. The autopsy showed multiple stab wounds to the right posterior chest area and a stab wound to the right side of the neck and incised wounds on the face and back of the neck. Significantly, there were numerous defence type wounds present on both hands. There were lacerations to the top and back of the head and other bruising that may have been caused by the knurled pattern on a billiard cue found near the body. Death resulted from the stab wounds. The offender, who is now 25 years old, had been employed by Colin Serone in a restaurant he operated in Coolangatta in mid 1997, initially as a kitchen hand but later as an apprentice chef. He worked there for about 18 months. He said he left on bad terms and claimed to be owed a substantial sum. Whilst I am prepared to accept that the offender was probably owed money by the Serones I think that he has exaggerated the amount. More importantly, however, I consider the fact of this debt, whatever its extent, to be irrelevant to the offender's culpability. It is merely part of the factual context. On 4 July 1999, early in the course of the police investigation, the offender was asked to make a statement, presumably to give some background information about the Serones and his own communications with one or other of them on or about the day that Mrs Serone was killed. There is no suggestion that he was a suspect at this time. In that statement the offender said, amongst other things, that on 24 June he had called the deceased's telephone number by mistake, that it had been answered by her husband Colin and that he hung up immediately after saying it was a wrong number. He said that he may have mistakenly redialled the number again. He denied seeing Mrs Serone after Christmas 1998 and claimed that he had not even spoken to her since he had left the restaurant. The police investigation later established that the offender had returned to his home on the night of the murder with blood on his hands and with a gold charm bracelet. He was spoken to again by detectives on 8 October 1999. He said that he got blood on him from a fight with his stepfather (Mr Schipp) on 22 June, namely, two days before the murder. The offender said that Mr Schipp's statement to police that he had not seen the accused for years was a deliberate lie motivated by malice. He also told the police that his call to the Serone house was intentional. He said that he owed Colin Serone $400 for drugs and was trying to contact him about paying. (I note that this seems to be inconsistent with the offender's claim that Mr Serone owed him money). He said that they arranged to meet, that he tried to call Mr Serone again from a nearby service station (where he was identified on a security video) but no-one answered. He then walked to the house where he spoke to Colin in the front garden and made arrangements, he claimed, to repay his drug debt. He said that the bracelet had been given by him to a former girlfriend and returned to him on 22 June. He said that he had thrown it away because he didn't want it and could not pawn it as he did not have a driving licence. The detectives then conducted a video interview with the offender. He elaborated further on his arrangement to meet with Mr Serone to discuss paying for the drugs and the telephone calls he made to the premises. He said, however, that despite the arrangement to meet at the house Mr Serone was not there and did not arrive, contradicting of course what he had earlier said and which I have already set out. He said that Mr Serone not having turned up he left the premises and went home. He gave a detailed account of what had occurred at his stepfather's house when he said he got blood on him and elaborated further on how he had purchased and what he had done with the bracelet. He said that his girlfriend's statement that she did not receive a charm bracelet from him was a lie. He implied that he believed Colin Serone may have committed the murder and said he was frightened of him. Continuing investigations led to the arrest of the offender on 27 October 1999. When cautioned he declined to say anything. He was charged with Mrs Serone's murder. In due course, as is usual, the prosecution brief of evidence was supplied to the offender's legal advisers. The case, though circumstantial, was a strong one. On 3 February 2000, as I understand it, when he was in Lismore Court for a brief hearing, the offender indicated to police that he wished to speak to them again saying ""I have a lot of guilt and I have to do time for that guilt"". Arrangements were made for an interview to be conducted on 10 February 2000. It is unnecessary to set out all that the offender said on that occasion. In essence, his account was that a few days before Mrs Serone's death, Mr Colin Serone had told him to kill his wife, threatening otherwise to hurt the offender's family, and offering to pay him $10,000 for the murder, paying him $1,000 then and promising him the balance in due course. The offender said he agreed. The arrangement was that the following Thursday the offender was to telephone Mr Serone at the house which would be left open. The offender said that he did so and Mr Serone confirmed that the door was open. The offender said that he got to the house at about 1.45pm, that the door was open and he went inside. He said that he was affected by amphetamines and came down whilst he waited for Mrs Serone to arrive from a shop she managed with her husband. She returned about 6.45pm. The offender had found a torch in the house and when Mrs Serone came into the entertainment area he attacked her with the torch. He claimed that he had hit her with the torch and then, when she was lying unconscious, fled the house taking the torch and Mrs Serone's handbag which contained money and the charm bracelet about which he had previously lied. He later threw these items off the Piggabeen Bridge where they were eventually recovered by police divers. The offender claimed the first he knew of Mrs Serone's death was on the radio. During the interview the offender said that he went to the house with the intention of killing Mrs Serone and indeed had taken one of his kitchen knives with him for this purpose. He said, however, that by the time Mrs Serone came home he had lost his confidence and ""didn't know how to do it"". He was unable to give any satisfactory explanation for remaining in the house waiting for Mrs Serone to return. He placed the knife in a green tapestry bag which he placed in the wardrobe in Mrs Serone's bedroom where it was later discovered. I accept that this knife was not used to kill Mrs Serone. In what was perhaps an unguarded answer he said that Mrs Serone saw him after she fell. He said that she was taken by surprise. He claimed that she did not try to defend herself but he categorically denied at this time either stabbing Mrs Serone or knowing anything about these wounds, clearly enough implying that Mr Serone was the murderer. It is obvious from what I have so far said that the offender is a versatile audacious and creative liar. In these proceedings a number of reports have been tendered that contain histories of the offender's personal life and reference to the commission of the offence, including his state of mind at the time. The offender has not given evidence on the plea and thus there is no sworn testimony to support the truth of what he told the various consultants. Nor have those accounts been tested by cross-examination. I am very sceptical about the truthfulness of anything said by the offender which could be regarded as self-serving. On 2 February 2001 the offender was arraigned in this Court. He pleaded not guilty. On 6 June 2001 the trial, having been set down to commence on 12 June, the offender changed his plea to guilty. The trial was expected to take four weeks. By his plea of guilty the offender has saved the State the trouble and expense of trying him and the witnesses the inconvenience and, in some cases, the distress of giving evidence. Some allowance must be given to him for the utilitarian benefit to the administration of justice of the offender's plea of guilty. In accordance with the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Thompson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 I propose to reduce the sentence I impose by 12 percent. By his plea of guilty the offender admitted all the elements of the crime of murder. As I will mention, he also admits he stabbed Mrs Serone. I am satisfied on the whole of the evidence that the offender inflicted all the injuries that Mrs Serone suffered. There can be no doubt that he intentionally killed her. It was a premeditated, brutal and cowardly attack on a middle aged woman in her own home. The reports tendered on the offender's behalf are a drug examine alcohol report by Mr George Klein, a clinical psychological assessment by Associate Professor Susan Hayes, a psychiatric report by Dr Rosalie Wilcox and an assessment of his drug use by Dr Robert Weatherby. It is a curious fact that, although all these experts reported in varying ways on the offenders involvement in and attitude to the crime, none of them had been given, as I read their reports, the extensive statements he made to police as the investigation unfolded. I deal first with the accounts given by the offender of facts directly connected with the murder. The offender said his connection with the Serone family arose from his employment at the restaurant operated by Mr and Mrs Serone. He said, in substance, that the business was in financial trouble and he got another job. He was owed a substantial sum for wages, superannuation and leave entitlements. The offender said that, when he complained, Mr Serone threatened him with serious physical injury. I state at once that there is no evidence to support this allegation. Even if it were true, and I do not accept that it is, it would not in any sense mitigate the offence. A few days before the murder the offender went on what he described as a ""bender"" using amphetamine and alcohol. There is support from other witnesses that he was using amphetamine and, possibly, methamphetamine, at the time. However, their accounts suggest the offender was using considerably less than he claimed. This is supported by his then having only limited financial resources. Whilst I accept that the offender was affected to some degree by amphetamine ingestion when he killed Mrs Serone, largely because of the savagery of the attack, suggestive of incomplete control, I do not accept that he was so intoxicated as to materially affect his culpability or mitigate the extent of his criminal responsibility. The offender said he called the house just before he arrived and when no one answered he gained entry through a rear bathroom window. It does seem clear that he stayed in the house for some four hours or so waiting for Mrs Serone to arrive. I do not believe this was to negotiate about his back entitlements. He knew she was coming from the shop she managed with her husband. It seems to me to be certain that the offender intended to rob Mrs Serone when she arrived and then to kill her when he realised she could identify him. Whether he contemplated the likelihood that he would have to kill her earlier in the piece or only made the decision after she identified him is unclear, although I think the former situation is the more likely. However, I have no doubt that he made a deliberate decision to kill her at or about the time of his attack on her. In substance, the offender told Dr Wilcox that after striking her on the head he killed Mrs Serone with a knife he took from the kitchen because he thought she recognised him. It will be recalled that the offender had brought his own knife to the premises. In the end he chose not to use it. It is unnecessary for present purposes for me to determine why this was so. It is inevitable that he brought his own knife envisaging that he might use it in some way. Whether he did use it to threaten Mrs Serone is unknown. That he used another knife to kill her is scarcely a mitigating factor. I note the murder weapon has not been found. The substance of the offender's present position is that he has resiled from the allegation that he acted as Mr Serone's instigation. This allegation could not, at all events be accepted, having regard to the offender's calculated and elaborate dishonesty concerning the circumstances of the offence. In fairness to Mr Serone I should add that the police investigation disclosed evidence that contradicted significant parts of the offender's allegations against him. To the consultants the offender expressed shame, disgust and remorse for what he had done. I am unable to assess the genuineness of these expressions and, in the light of all the circumstances, I am doubtful that they were genuine. The offender told Dr Wilcox his decision to plead guilty was part of the process of dealing with what he then had done, of taking responsibility for his actions. I think it is true that his plea is a recognition of reality but I do not accept it as demonstrating any remorse or contrition. Neither Dr Wilcox nor Professor Hayes thought that there was anything significant in the offender’s psychiatric or psychological make up that might explain or mitigate the crime. On the other hand, there does not appear to be any psychological or psychiatric impediment to his eventual rehabilitation, except of course that which might be implied from the commission of the crime itself. The offender’s personal history, as given by him to the defence consultants and described by his mother in a statement tendered on his behalf, shows an unhappy and troubled childhood. He was a victim of violence at the hands of his stepfather and was forced to leave home in his mid teens going to live at a refuge and then with his girlfriend's parents, where he lived for three or four years. It is, I think, fair to accept that his earlier years have not given the offender the personal resources to resist drug abuse but there is no indication that his personality is characterised by traits typically seen in violet individuals. The psychometric tests of Professor Hayes seem to be consistent with this conclusion. This evidence does not help to explain the offender's appalling crime. But, as I have said, it does permit the conclusion that there does not appear to be present in his personality any particular obstacle to rehabilitation. There is a public interest, frequently stated by the courts, in rehabilitation which is all the stronger for young or relatively young offenders. I am bound to adjust the sentence to take this into account. The offender asks the Court to take into account an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding that occurred on or about 24 June 1999. This is the offence constituted by the theft of Mrs Serone's handbag following the assaults. I consider that I should accede to this request. Taking into account all these circumstances the only matter capable of providing any mitigation is the offender's relative immaturity. To my mind, the circumstances of the offence would otherwise place it close to, if not into, the category of worst cases. There are no special circumstances. David Andrew Wright for the murder of Mrs Peggy Serone, taking into account the offence referred to in the Form 1, and the discount for your plea of guilty, you are sentenced to a term of twenty two years’ imprisonment commencing on 27 October 1999. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 26 April 2016.  **************

      Introduction 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 27 August 2001 Jason Raymond Young was arraigned on indictment before this Court on one count of murder. He was charged that on 15 July 2000 at St Marys he murdered Pieter Izak Hage. He pleaded not guilty to the charge but guilty to the offence of manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. The offence is a contravention of s 24 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 2  The Crown alleges the assault, which resulted in the death of Mr Hage, was part of an attempted robbery of the deceased. The offender has at all times maintained that the assault arose in circumstances other than attempted robbery; namely that he thought the deceased (then victim) said something to which he took exception. He then punched and kicked the victim who, shortly afterwards, died. The offender says he was in company with Junior Vaa Mamae who also kicked the victim. 3  The Court is required to resolve this factual dispute and determine the circumstances in which the assault took place. That finding is of particular importance because the unlawful and dangerous act amounting to manslaughter, upon which the Crown alleges, is one of an assault with intent to rob. 4  Before turning to the evidence in respect of the factual dispute the I will record the non-controversial facts and circumstances of the case set out in the statement of facts tendered in evidence. 5  At about 1.20am on Saturday 15 July 2000 Ms Linda Reid, a resident in Edgar Street, St Marys, noticed the body of a person lying on the footpath near the corner of Edgar Street and Mamre Road. She telephoned the St Marys Police. 6  The first police officers arrived at about 2am. They were Constables Flood and Astridge. The person seen by Ms Reid, and who was later identified as Pieter Izak Hage, 46 years of age, a resident of 18 Edgar Street, St Marys. He was examined and found to be deceased. He had sustained a number of head injuries, including a laceration to the left eye. Some of his pockets had been turned out and nearby four TAB tickets were located. The deceased's wallet, containing $25 in notes, credit and other personal cards, was located in his rear right trousers pocket. It was established that the TAB tickets were purchased earlier in the evening at the St Marys Band Club, where the deceased had spent the evening before walking home. 7  The post-mortem examination established that the deceased died from head injuries; the effects of alcohol- his reading was .285; a coronary atherosclerosis, and enlargement of the heart. The deceased had sustained a number of recent head and bodily injuries which, on their own, in the opinion of the Forensic Pathologist, Dr Little, would not have been sufficient to cause death. Dr Little is able to give evidence also that the injuries, in her opinion, did not amount to grievous bodily harm.Dr Little's opinion is that the trauma, associated with the injuries, caused stress upon the diseased heart and, with the high blood alcohol reading, brought about the death of the deceased. 8  In response to a television news report of Mr Hage's death two young men, Paul Hommel and Timothy Eisenhuth, reported that they had seen and heard of an assault upon a man near the intersection of Edgar Street and Mamre Road at about 1am on Saturday 15 July 2000. They were walking in a southerly direction on the eastern side of Mamre Road when they noticed a middle aged man, who appeared to be drunk, also walking in a southerly direction but on the western side of Mamre Road.9  Mr Hommel heard the sound of punches and turned his head to see a young tall skinny blonde male (the offender) punch the middle-aged man (the deceased) to the head three times. The middle-aged man then tumbled backwards. He heard the blonde male say, ""Give me your wallet"". In evidence Mr Hommel stated he was not sure if this was said by the blonde male or the dark-skinned small male with him. Mr Hommel stated that while this was occurring the dark-skinned male (Junior Mamae) was facing away from the incident and looking around. Mr Hommel and Mr Eisenhuth did not stop and continued walking to their homes. 10  Mr Eisenhuth heard a sound and turned his head to see the blonde male standing very close to the middle-aged man. He heard the blonde male say, ""Give me your wallet"" and the middle aged man say something which he could not make out. He saw the blonde male push the middle aged man with open hands to his chest causing him to fall, while standing, into a wire fence. He saw the blonde male slip over backwards and, at this stage, saw the dark-skinned male step towards the middle-aged man. He then saw the blonde male get up and, as he did, the middle-aged man took a step forward away from the fence. He then saw the blonde male punch the middle-aged man in the mouth which caused him to move backwards but not fall to the ground. He and Mr Hommel continued on their way home. 11  Police investigating the death of Mr Hage took possession of a security video from the Quix Service Station at the corner of Wilson Street and Mamre Road, St Marys, two blocks from where Mr Hage was assaulted. Mr Hommel viewed the video and identified two young men appearing in it between 12.16 and 12.20am, 15 July 2000, as the two men he had seen when the middle aged man was assaulted. Even though Mr Hommel was able to identify the two men at the assault of Mr Hage, police could not establish their identity until 1 September 2000, when information was received that the offender and Junior Mamae were the two in question. Both were arrested that day and interviewed on ERISP. 12  The offender admitted punching the deceased twice to the head and, when the deceased fell to the ground, kicking him twice, once to the stomach and once to the right thigh. He said that Mamae then kicked the deceased two or three times from the shoulders upwards. They then walked off to the Band Club. 13  The offender denied saying, ""Give me your wallet"", and denied knowledge of the deceased's pockets being turned out or of any robbery or attempted robbery. 14  The offender explained that he and Mamae, with two girls, attended the St Marys RSL Club during the evening. The offender and Mamae left the RSL Club and walked to the nearby Quix Service Station, on their way to the St Marys Band Club, where they expected to meet up with the two girls. From the Quix Service Station the offender and Mamae walked north along Mamre Road, in the direction of the Band Club, when they came upon the deceased, who was walking towards them, on his way home. The offender claims he thought the deceased said something to him (Q 268): ""Just mouthing off, I thought he was like being smart"", and punched and kicked the deceased because he was angry and annoyed that the deceased had spoken to him.15  The offender said the assault took place near the corner of Mamre Road and Edgar Street and the last he saw of the deceased he was crawling down Edgar Street. 16  Junior Mamae admitted he had attended the RSL with the offender and two girls that evening and walked to the Quix Service Station. He denied participating in, or being present, when the deceased was assaulted. He claims that a friend picked him and the offender up from the Quix Service Station and drove them to the Band Club. 17  The Court will now turn to the disputed issues of fact. The evidence before the Court touched on some of the matters that I have recited from the statement of facts.18  Detective Senior Constable Seymour from the St Marys Local Area Command gave evidence. He was the senior investigator in this matter. He conducted the record of interview with the offender, which was tendered in evidence. He agreed that the offender told him that he made a confession to a co-worker, Mr Vella, to the effect that he was responsible for the death of Mr Hage. The offender was then 18 years of age. He denied any motive to rob the deceased. He freely admitted to kicking him and causing his death. There was no evidence that anyone saw the offender go through the pockets of Mr Hage during or after the assault. 19  The detective acknowledged there was a period of about 20 minutes before a local resident first saw Mr Hage's body. About 40 minutes after that police arrived on the scene. 20  Detective Seymour said that in his opinion any evidence that the offender would give at the trial of Junior Mamae, based on the record of interview, would be an important part of the prosecution case against Mr Mamae. It is evidence that places Mr Mamae at the scene of the crime. 21  Paul Hommel gave evidence. He told the Court that the voice saying, ""Give me your wallet"", was fairly loud and he heard it from across the road. He did not hear any other words. He thought that the voice was a ""normal voice of an Australian person"". The two young men were about 20 metres away from him when he heard the words spoken. He was on the opposite side of the road and he was pretty sure that he was looking backwards towards the two young men. After he heard the words he and his friend kept on walking towards their respective homes. They did not talk about what was said because they were considering whether they should offer the victim some help. Mr Hommel said he thought the victim would be all right and he said that, ""We just thought he would get up and go home, just rolled him for his wallet"". He saw the man being punched. He decided not to report the matter to the police at that stage and went home. He telephoned his friend the next day when he heard that Mr Hage had died. It was then that he decided to inform the police. He did not have any conversation with his friend about the words spoken by one of the men at the scene. He has not read Mr Eisenhuth's statement and has not discussed with him the circumstances that he heard the words, ""Give me your wallet"". 22  Mr Eisenhuth gave evidence. He told the Court he was walking away from the scene and looking back towards the scene. He was walking quite close to his friend when he heard the words, ""Give me your wallet"". He did hear the man being assaulted say something but he was unable to say what it was. He attributed the words, ""Give me your wallet"", to the offender on the basis that the offender was standing and facing the victim and, what he described as the ""shorter guy"", was further back. In these circumstances he thought it more likely that it was the offender who spoke. 23  He said that he and Mr Hommel decided that the victim was being robbed and that they did not want to become involved, so they walked home. He confirmed that the next day he learnt from Mr Hommel that the victim had died and it was decided to contact the police. He said that he and Mr Hommel did not have any discussion before he made his statement about the fact that they had both heard the words, ""Give me your wear wallet"". He has not subsequently read Mr Hommel's statement. When pressed he was firm in his view that he had heard the words spoken. 24  The offender gave evidence. He told the Court that he said to Mr Vella, in substance, he thought he had killed someone. He felt ashamed of what he had done and that was part of the reason for telling Mr Vella. He said that he told the police that he thought Mr Hage said something which made him angry and that was the reason for attacking him. He said that he had no intention of stealing money from the deceased and did not in fact steal anything from him.25  The offender left school when halfway through Year 10. He started working straight away and was regularly employed between leaving school and his arrest. 26  He said that he has had a problem with alcohol. He began drinking heavily when he was about sixteen. He said that he was unhappy because of what he had done. He said he told Mr Vella that after the man mumbled something to him he hit him and then started kicking him. When he was on the ground Junior Mamae joined in. He gave the police the same version of events as he gave to Mr Vella. He said that neither he nor Mr Mamae said to Mr Hage, ""Give me your wallet"". Further, he said that neither of them turned out Mr Hage's pockets. He told the Court of the movements of himself and Junior Mamae during the evening, from the time Mr Mamae picked him up in his car to their time at St Marys RSL Club, following their visit to the Quix Service Station, and the fact as they walked along Mamre Road they came across the victim. At that time it was their intention to walk to the St Marys Band Club. After the assault they went to the Band Club and left in the early hours of Saturday morning. They went to the house of a young woman they knew.27  The offender's mother gave evidence. She confirmed that at the time of her son's arrest he was living at home and had commenced to drink alcohol when he was about 16 or 17. 28 The Court was impressed with the evidence from both Mr Hommel and Mr Eisenhuth. It accepts the two young men did not discuss their evidence with each other before making their statements to police officers. Further, they have not done so since. Both had a very clear recollection of what they heard. In these circumstances, the fact they both had the same recollection of the words used by either the offender or Mr Mamae, ""Give me your wallet"", points to it being the fact rather than a concoction. 29  The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the words were said by one or other; the offender or Mr Mamae. The evidence was compelling and cogent from two witnesses who clearly were doing their best to tell the truth. There was nothing in their evidence to suggest they might be mistaken. Consistent with what Mr Hommel and Mr Eisenhuth heard is the circumstance that the victim's body was found at 2 o'clock with his pockets turned out. Some betting tickets were found nearby which, most likely, came from the deceased's pockets. The Court considers it extremely unlikely some other persons came along and turned out the deceased's pockets. 30  The Court is satisfied that this offence was a joint criminal enterprise between the offender and Junior Mamae. The assault was for the purpose of robbery. Both the offender and Junior Mamae participated in the attack. The offender struck the victim to the head and kicked him. Junior Mamae kicked the victim in the area above the shoulders and demanded the victim hand over this wallet.  THE OFFENCE   31  The Court finds that the injuries the victim received do not amount to grievous bodily harm. They, by themselves, did not result in serious injury. So much is clear from Dr Little's findings. The victim was an unhealthy man who was intoxicated at the time he was assaulted by the offender and Mr Mamae. The blows to him, from the offender and Mr Mamae, resulted in his death. 32  The offence of manslaughter is a particularly serious crime, since it involves the taking of a human life, the protection of which is the primary objective of the criminal justice system (R v Veech [2001] NSWSC 68). In R v Blacklidge NSWCCA December 1995 Gleeson CJ at 4 said: ""It has long been recognised the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability are so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes common manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.  At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of human life, and a key element is the assessment of the objective circumstances of the case (R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.)"" 33  The fact that the offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years provides a powerful indicator as to the seriousness with which it is regarded and to ensure that the sentence is commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, in the sense that, having regard to all the proved circumstances of the case, it accords with the general moral sense of the community. 34  This is a case where the offender did not have in mind occasioning serious harm to the victim by beating. The object was to rob the victim. It was, however, a serious assault. An innocent member of the community was punched and kicked while on the ground. He was intoxicated and simply walking to his home.   THE GUILTY PLEA   35  The Court takes into account the offender's plea of guilty. In this case the recognition by the offender of what he has done amounts to a degree of contrition on his part. His plea of guilty also has significant utilitarian value. 36  From the outset he has placed himself at the scene of the crime. He has made significant admissions as to the assault upon the deceased. He has not, however, conceded the purpose of the assault. 37  The nature of the admissions by the offender made at a very early time do entitle him to be treated on the same basis as an early plea.   CO-OPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES   38  The offender is entitled, pursuant to section 23 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to a reduction in penalty for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities. 39  The Court notes that, although the assistance to authorities should be seen to result in a substantial discount, there is no fixed amount and it need not be quantified separately; R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, where the matter is discussed generally, and where R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 is considered.40  In deciding to impose a lesser penalty for the offence, in considering the matters set out in s 23, the Court records, in particular, that it regards the admissions made by the offender as reliable but not his statements concerning the demand for the victim's wallet. 41 Applying R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 the Court is also of opinion that this is a case where a single combined quantification for the plea and co-operation to the authorities is appropriate for these reasons. The information the offender gave during his record of interview places Junior Mamae at the scene of the crime. This is of significant assistance to the Crown in Mamae's trial. In this way the offender's record of interview links his concessions to his co-operation with the authorities. 42  However, the Court notes that from the outset it has been made clear to the offender that he would be called to give evidence in any trial of Junior Vaa Mamae. In the result he has chosen to do this voluntarily.43  The Court is mindful that leniency under s 23 will generally be recognised by a reduction of the total sentence and the sentencing Court would be expected to indicate why it is to be reflected in a decrease in the minimum term where special circumstances are found. (R v S [2000] NSWCCA 13; (2000) 7 Crim LN 10. There are common elements in considering the combined discount discussed above and special circumstances. 44  The offender's contrition, repentance and remorse are mitigating factors. Such remorse is taken into account in mitigation quite independently of any discount to be given for assistance to authorities (""C"" 18 February 1993 Hunt CJ at Cl.)45  The Court takes into account the offender's sentence is likely to be more harsh because there will be a need for it to be served in protection. This was recognised in R v Darrel Bruce Lewis 100 A Crim R 361. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES  46  The Court finds that there are special circumstances in this case that require it to adjust the relationship between the non-parole period and the total term as governed by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender was 18 at the time of the offence. He is now 19. The youth of an offender will generally mean less weight is to be given to deterrence and more to rehabilitation (See R v Wilkie NSWCCA 2 July 1992 Badgery-Parker J) 47  The offender has identified his violent conduct with alcohol abuse and taken steps to undertake drug and alcohol counselling. He gave the impression when giving evidence that he wants to adjust his behaviour and not become involved with offences of violence again. He has some criminal history but it does not indicate that he has a previous history of significant violence. This is a positive sign for rehabilitation.48  In setting the appropriate relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period the Court bears in mind the remarks of Hulme J, R v S [2000] NSWCCA 13, where his Honour held:  ""However, that is not to say that there were not errors in what his Honour did. There were, in my view, two. The first was in not recognising that the disadvantages of strict protection and indeed all aspects of assistance to the authorities had already been allowed for in the discount given on this account or in failing to explain why his Honour thought he was entitled to give both the discount he thought 'generally regarded as the upper limit of the discount to be applied' and also to exhibit leniency by way of variation of the normal proportion between the minimum and additional terms. Although it seems to me leniency, which assistance to the authorities commonly attracts, may properly find expression in an increase in an additional term (presumably at the expense of a minimum term) it is at least necessary for a judge adopting this course to provide some explanation why this has occurred rather than the leniency being reflected in the more usual reduction in the total term - a fortiori when such a reduction has already been given.""  49 His Honour also referred to what was said in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 107:  ""The sentencing judge, having found special circumstances, has a good deal of  room to move in the structure of the sentence to be imposed. However, the discretion conferred by s 5(2) should always be exercised with one eye to the relevant minimum term which must be such as to reflect the objective gravity of the crime for which it is imposed, taking into account the subjective features ...    A sentencing judge who varies the statutory proportions in favour of a lengthier additional term needs to take care to ensure that the minimum term is no lower than that which is commensurate with the objective gravity of the crime."" 50  The Court is of opinion that the combined discount for the plea of guilty and the co-operation with authorities should be 25 per cent. The Court also considers that in balancing the objective seriousness of the offence causing the death of the victim, with the subjective factors discussed, that the appropriate sentence in this matter is six years. Adjusting the non-parole period, to take into account the special circumstances, the Court sets a non-parole period of four years to be backdated to 1 September 2000 when the offender first entered custody in relation to this matter.51  Convicted. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment for six years. I set a non-parole period of four years to commence on 1 September 2000 and to conclude on 31 August 2004 when the offender is eligible to be considered for release to parole.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONIRELAND AJTuesday, 4 September, 200170026/01 - REGINA v A.N.G.SENTENCE 
     
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The offender, ANG, was committed for trial from Cobham Children’s Court on 5 April 2001 on a charge alleging that he, on 9 October 1999 at Emu Plains, murdered GAC, the deceased, who was his uncle. 
     
      
    2    Upon arraignment in the Supreme Court on 6 July 2001, upon that charge, the offender pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of the indictment. The basis upon which the Crown accepted the plea was that of criminal negligence by pushing the semi-conscious body of the deceased into the Nepean River, resulting in his death by drowning. 
     
      
    3    It is agreed as between the parties that the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty to a charge of manslaughter prior to the committal hearing and that whilst the Director of Public Prosecutions did not act unreasonably in requiring the testing of evidence at committal in a charge as serious as murder, nevertheless, 6 July 2001 was, in the circumstances, the first opportunity available to the offender to enter his plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter. R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) NSW CCA 309 (17.8.2000). 
     
      
    4    It is common ground as between the parties that the agreed facts to which I shall refer represent as complete and accurate an outline as is possible to distil from what has been described as a confusing and inconsistent body of evidence. 
     
      
       
      Background of the Deceased 
       
      
    5    The deceased, GAC, who was born on 9 April 1968, was aged thirty one years at the time of his death and was the youngest brother of the offender’s mother. Throughout his adulthood he lived an aimless life given to significant substance and alcohol abuse thought to have contributed to his state of clinical depression. 
     
      
    6    On a number of occasions, leading up to the time of his death, the deceased told various members of his family of his feelings that his life was “not worth living”. He was observed by family members over a period of time to have neglected his appearance, personal hygiene and nutrition. 
     
      
    7    Of real significance in the material placed before the Court in these sentencing proceedings is the unchallenged statement of the grandmother of the offender, who is also the mother of the deceased. This lady, who is the mother of six children, has been closely involved in the upbringing of her grandson, the offender, as well as her youngest son, the deceased, and has first hand knowledge of the deceased’s apparent suicidal ideation. This lady is also cognisant of the affection with which the offender and the deceased regarded each other, as well as the depth of family support for the offender to which I shall return. 
     
      
       
      The events causing death 
       
      
    8    On Saturday, 9 October 1999 the offender, who was then aged sixteen years and eight months, went to visit friends at 47 River Road, Emu Plains. The deceased resided at those premises. The offender was forbidden to attend those premises by his parents who held the well founded belief that drugs were used there. 
     
      
    9    During the afternoon and evening, without his consent, a number of the offender’s drinks were ‘spiked’ with the amphetamine known as ‘speed’. 
     
      
    10    The deceased also consumed alcohol and drugs. Post mortem blood and urine analysis conducted by the Division of Analytical Laboratories disclose the blood alcohol reading of 0.226 grams per 100 millilitres of blood, together with the presence of Ketamine, amphetamine and delta-9 -THC acid, which is the major active drug present in cannabis, in various quantities. The cause of death was established to be drowning. 
     
      
    11    In the opinion of the forensic scientist, Dr William Allender, the deceased, at the time of death, was under the influence of alcohol and the Ketamine would have enhanced its central nervous system depressant effects. 
     
      
    12    Between 7 pm and 9 pm on the evening of 9 October, 1999 the deceased and the offender walked across the road from number 47 River Road down to the western bank of the Nepean River. 
     
      
    13    The offender said that at the river bank the deceased was grieving about the state of his life, being drug-addicted and having a relationship with a twelve year old girl. 
     
      
    14    The deceased said that he wanted to end his life but did not have “… enough guts …” to do it himself. He told the offender that when he had taken certain tablets which he had with him and alcohol he would be “knocked out” after which he wanted the offender to push him into the water and “let him go”. 
     
      
    15    The offender described the deceased as having taken “seven or eight tablets” before drinking “… heaps of alcohol …” after which the deceased lay on a rock at the water’s edge and closed his eyes. Thereafter the offender pushed the deceased into the water and walked back to 47 River Road where he told others what he had done. 
     
      
    16    The offender returned with two of his friends to the river bank to find the body of the deceased in the water. A check of the pulse established the body to be deceased. 
     
      
    17    The body was removed from the water and the offender went to 47 River Road where he obtained a motor vehicle. The three persons carried the body of the deceased to the vehicle which was driven by the offender to Lapstone Creek. The offender dragged the deceased from the vehicle through some ten metres of bush to the north side of Lapstone Creek and put the body in the creek. 
     
      
    18    The deceased’s body was located about 3.30 pm on Sunday, 10 October 1999 by children. The body was identified by finger prints. 
     
      
    19    Following identification of the deceased, the family was contacted. On 11 October 1999 the offender made a statement denying any knowledge of the death. On 13 October 1999 he returned to Penrith Police Station with his mother and took part in a recorded interview with Detective Senior Constable Pascoe. A recorded statement of the offender disclosed the events causing the death of the deceased to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    20    Evidence given at the committal hearing by others present at 47 River Road and on the river bank during the evening of 9 October 1999, described the offender, after his drinks had been ‘spiked’, variously, inter alia, as ‘smashed’, ‘stoned’ and ‘well affected’ and complaining of ‘… not feeling very well and didn’t know what was going on’. Evidence was also given, at committal, of the anger expressed by the offender when he became aware of the fact that his drinks had been contaminated, albeit as a practical joke or as a so described ‘party trick’. The distinguishing feature present in this regard is that the intoxication of the offender cannot in a material sense be categorised as wholly voluntary or self induced. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    21    The subjective circumstances attending the offender warrant careful consideration. He was, as I have observed, aged sixteen years and eight months at the time of the offence and is presently eighteen and a half years of age. 
     
      
    22    His school career, which he had hoped to progress to tertiary qualifications, was cut short when following the laying of the charge of murder, he was expelled from school. He at once became apprenticed to his father as an automotive technician employed in his father’s business where he has continued, undertaking the associated TAFE course in which he has completed two of the three years of the course which I am informed requires a further year of practical training following the academic segment. The offender is on all accounts assiduously applying himself to his employment and to his training and studies.  
     
      
    23    The offender has an unblemished record and is highly regarded by members of his family, many of whom have made statements which testify to him being a respectful and well behaved young man, who has been deeply affected by the events which bring him before the Court. He is remorseful and contrite in his expressions of regret to family members, who find his involvement in the death of his uncle to be quite out of character. 
     
      
    24    The offender is part of a large family whose members reside in the Penrith area and whose social activities largely revolve around family functions and celebrations. One rarely sees family support of the strength evidenced in this case by the statements and presence in Court of many family members unanimous in the favourable views they hold. In this regard I am greatly assisted by the reports of officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice being that of Ms Nadine Bedo of 20 August 2001 and Ms Gina Proudlove of 21 August 2001. 
     
      
    25    The latter comprehensive report of Ms Proudlove has been of great assistance to the Court in understanding the family background and personal history of the offender. 
     
      
    26    It is clear from the material tendered that the part played by the offender in the death of the deceased has impacted heavily upon him and that he will carry the burden of his involvement throughout his future life. 
     
      
    27    I am satisfied that the extensive contact with the family and the offender which the Juvenile Justice Officer, Ms Proudlove, has undertaken has placed her in a position to assess not only the veracity of the offender’s remorse and contrition and the distress which he experiences, which I accept, but also the change in course along which the offender now directs his lifestyle with the strong support of his parents and wider family. I recognise also the benefit of counselling which the offender has received and should continue so to do. 
     
      
    28    It has been urged upon the court by Mr Greenhill, Senior Counsel for the offender, that this is an exceptional case which may appropriately be considered in the light of the deceased’s request to the offender to do what he did resulting in the compassionate response of the offender in his state of confusion largely imposed by the acts of others. Accordingly, it is submitted that the demands of justice and rightful community expectations may be satisfied without the need to interrupt and fragment the offender’s employment and rehabilitation, which are respectively stable and well advanced, by the imposition of a sentence which would require the offender to at once be taken into custody. 
     
      
    29    It is to be noted that Mr Dare, Crown Prosecutor, submits that such a course would not demonstrate error in sentencing in the conceded exceptional circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    30    The protean nature of the crime of manslaughter and the consequential wide range of sentences imposed has frequently been the subject of judicial recognition in this and other courts. 
     
      
    31    In R v Troja (NSW CCA 16.7.1991 - unreported) at 3, Kirby P said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ”It is trite to say that the range of sentences available on a conviction of manslaughter is greater than for virtually any other crime. This is because of the high maximum sentence fixed by Parliament and the great variety of activities which may constitute manslaughter ranging, as they do, from the morally almost innocent to the seriously culpable. See  
        The Queen v Wide 
         (NSW CCA -14.4.1989 - unreported).” 
        
       
      
    32    It is also trite to say that the sentence which is appropriate in each case of manslaughter depends on its own special circumstances. 
     
      
    33    In R v Blacklidge (NSW CCA - 12.12.1995) at 4 Gleeson CJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. ( 
        R v Dodd  
        (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 
        ; R v Hill  
        (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402).” 
        
       
      
    34    The likelihood of the offender re-offending is, in light of the material placed before the court, remote. In terms of general deterrence the exceptional circumstances of this case render the penalty to be imposed of extremely limited application as an example to others. 
     
      
    35    The mitigating features of an early plea, together with genuine contrition and remorse, sound strongly in the offender’s favour, however, in my view considerations of rehabilitation warrant paramount emphasis. In saying this I do not wish it to be thought that I am losing sight of the important part which the law is called upon to play in upholding the protection of human life and in the appropriate punishment of those who take it. 
     
      
    36    In R v Smith (1964) Crim L R 70 the English Court of Criminal Appeal said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… in the case of a young offender there can rarely be any conflict between his interest and the public’s. The public have no greater interest than that he should become a good citizen.” 
        
       
      
    37    That principle has been accorded recognition in a series of cases assembled in the judgment of Newman J in R v Hungerford (SC NSW - 17.8.1993 unreported) at 9; and see also R v GDP (NSW CCA - 24.4.1991 unreported) per Mathews J at 10. 
     
      
    38    The progress towards rehabilitation of the offender over the past twenty months and his response to the support afforded to him, together with the other mitigating circumstances to which I have referred, warrants the exercise of the court’s discretion to suspend sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    39    ANG for the manslaughter of GAC of which you have been convicted, you are sentenced to 2 years imprisonment to date from today. The sentence will expire on 3 September 2003. 
     
      
    40    Pursuant to s 12(1)(a) of the Act, I order that execution of the sentence be suspended for the 2 year term of the sentence. 
     
      
    41    Pursuant to s 12(1)(b), I direct that the offender be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for a term of 2 years, concurrent with this sentence, the said bond to include the following conditions:- 
     
      
       
      That the offender will: 
       
       
      (1) be of good behaviour in every respect; 
       
       
      (2) reside with his parents; 
       
       
      (3) not associate with any persons not approved by his parents; 
       
       
      (4) continue with his TAFE course and his apprenticeship to completion; 
       
       
      (5) maintain his full-time employment; 
       
       
      (6) accept the supervision and direction of Juvenile Justice Community Services Officers, including attendance at the Intensive Programs Unit as directed to receive offence specific counselling.
