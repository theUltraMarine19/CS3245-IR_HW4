ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Statements
by accused at time of arrest—Admissibility in evidence

At a trial on a charge of
committing assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the constable who arrested
accused gave evidence for the Crown to the effect that, at the time of the
arrest, having cautioned accused,

[Page 259]

and accused having stated that
he had not been out since twelve o'clock that night, he called accused's
attention to the condition of his hat, and accused said he had not worn that
hat the night the offence was committed; the constable also called accused's
attention to a scrape on his arm, and accused said it was an old mark, whereas
the constable testified that it was fresh.

Held, reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia ([1927] 1 W.W.R. 471), that the evidence was admissible; the
Crown discharged its burden of establishing the voluntary character of the
statements of accused, who had been given the customary warning; the mere
asking of a question by the constable subsequently, or his directing accused's
attention to the subject of one of such statements, did not amount to an
inducement or persuasion-such as would render the statements inadmissible. Prosko
v. The King (63 Can. S.C.R. 226) referred to.

APPEAL by the Attorney General
of the province of British Columbia from the judgment of the Court
of Appeal for the said province[1] setting
aside the conviction of, and granting a new trial to, the respondent who had
been convicted, on trial before Murphy J. and a jury, of committing an assault
occasioning actual bodily harm. The ground upon which the Court of Appeal
proceeded was that of error in wrongfully admitting evidence.

The evidence of which wrongful
admission was claimed was that of a constable of the municipal police of the
said province, who arrested the respondent, and who was called at the trial as
a witness for the Crown. He testified that on making the arrest he cautioned
the respondent and told him that he (the respondent) was not bound to say
anything, but that if he did say anything it might be used in evidence against
him; the respondent made a statement that he was in bed since twelve o'clock
and that he had not been out since twelve o'clock that night; the constable
called the attention of the respondent to the condition of the respondent's
hat, and the respondent said he had not worn that hat the night the offence was
committed, but that he had worn another; the constable also at the same time
called the respondent's attention to a scrape on respondent's arm; the
constable in his evidence said as to this

*** There was a scrape on
his arm here about one-half inch wide and I would say about two or three inches
long as if it had been pushed against something.

[Page 260]

Q. Was it recent?—A. Yes. I
drew his attention to it and he said that was an old mark, that it had been
there a long time, but as a matter of fact it was fresh. It was wet, and there
was blood oozing through; it was not cut far enough to let the blood come
freely but it was a fresh bruise.

The judgments of the Court of
Appeal were delivered orally. In his judgment Macdonald C.J.A. said:

I found my judgment entirely
upon the wrongful admission of the evidence which appears at page 99 in the
appeal book, where it appears that while the police sergeant said that he
warned this man at the time of his arrest yet it further appears that later on,
apparently, he called the accused's attention to his hat and to the condition
it was in, eliciting a statement with regard to it, but the most serious thing
of all was his calling attention to a mark or wound in accused's arm. He says
this, ""there was a scrape on his arm here about one-half an inch wide and
I would say about two or three inches long, as if it had been pushed against
something."" The accused, according to the Crown's case, had been in a
fracas in the rooming house and naturally one would look for wounds and the
sergeant did look for wounds and found this ""scrape on his arm."" And
then he says, ""Yes, I drew his attention to it and he said it was an old
mark that had been there a long time but as a matter of fact it was
fresh."" What was the probable effect of that? It was practically
intimating to the jury that the man had told a direct falsehood to him when he
had questioned him at the time of his arrest. That would affect the prisoner's
testimony in the witness box, it would affect the credence to be attached to it
and it might very well have influenced the jury in finding the verdict which
they did find. Therefore, in my opinion, there was a substantial wrong which
amounts to a miscarriage of justice and the conviction must be set aside and a
new trial ordered.

Martin J.A. agreed upon the
ground that what the constable did at the time of the arrest amounted to
improper extraction of information, by questions, from the accused, which
tended to destroy his defence, which was an alibi. Galliher, McPhillips and
Macdonald J.J.A. agreed that there should be a new trial.

Application was made for leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, on the ground that the judgment of the
Court of Appeal conflicted with the judgments of other courts of appeal in like
cases. Leave to appeal was granted by Newcombe J. under s. 1024A of the Criminal
Code .

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the
appellant.

No one appeared for the
respondent.

Without hearing argument by Mr.
Ritchie, the Chief Justice orally delivered the judgment of the court as
follows:

""We have all had an
opportunity of considering this case, and we are satisfied that the order
appealed from is wrong. The evidence in question was properly received at 

[Page 261]

the trial. The matter was fully
considered here in Prosko v. The King (1). The Crown discharged
its burden of establishing the voluntary character of the statements made by
the accused who had been given the customary warning. The mere asking of a
question by the officer subsequently, or his directing the accused's attention
to the subject of one of such statements, did not amount to an inducement or
persuasion such as would render the statements inadmissible. The appeal is
allowed and the conviction is reinstated.""

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal Law—Evidence—Corroboration—Cr.
Code, s. 1002 (as amended, 1925, c. 38, s. 26)—Nature of evidence required for
corroboration—Charge of offence, under Cr. Code, s. 301, of carnally knowing
girl under 14 years of age.

The corroboration required by s. 1002  of the Criminal
Code  (as amended 1925, c. 38, s. 26 ) must be by evidence independent of the
complainant, and it must tend to show that the accused committed the crime
charged (R. v. Baskerville, [1916] 2 K.B. 658). The question
whether there is any evidence within that description, on which a jury could
find corroboration, is one of law; although, whether corroborative inferences
should be drawn is a question for the jury (R. v. Gray, 68 J.P.
327).

On a charge of carnally knowing a girl under
14 years of age, under s. 301  of the Criminal Code , it was held
(reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 36 Man. R. 373 ) that
the identification, by its plate number and a certain cushion, by the girl, of
accused’s motor car as the one driven at the time of the offence by the person
committing it, was not, in a proper sense, independent evidence tending to
connect accused with the crime, and therefore did not fulfil the requirement as
to corroboration of the girl’s evidence that accused committed the offence. But
the Court was of opinion that, while the evidence was not explicit that accused
maintained silence when charged with the crime on his arrest, and again when
confronted with and identified by the girl, his conduct on those occasions, so
far as disclosed, and in subsequently voluntarily making two inconsistent
statements, was such that a jury, or a judge trying the case without a jury,
might infer from it some acknowledgment of guilt; whether such inferences
should be drawn was a question of fact; (R. v. Christie [1914]
A.C. 545, at pp. 554, 559-560, 563-564, 565-566; Mash v. Barley [1914]
3 K.B. 1226, at pp. 1230-1231, 1234; R, v. Feigenbaum [1919] 1
K.B. 431, at pp. 433-434, cited); ha such conduct of used been found by the
trial judge to be corroborative of the girl’s story the conviction could not
have been set aside: but there being no finding by the trial judge as to the
inference to be drawn from such conduct of accused, nor any adjudication that
it afforded the requisite corroboration, this Court could not, without usurping
the exclusive function of the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication; the
trial judge’s ruling that accused’s admission of ownership of the car and its
identification by the girl constituted corroborative evidence, was erroneous,
and resulted in a mistrial; the case did not fall within the saving operation
of s. 1014 (2)  (as enacted 1923, c. 41) of the Criminal Code , and the
conviction should be set aside; but the Court, in the exercise of its
discretion under s. 1014 (3) , refused to direct accused’s discharge, and
ordered a hew trial.

[Page 444]

Final Code, on
appeal, based on the grounds, (a) of noncorroboration of the evidence of
the complainant, and (b) of absence of proof that the complainant was
not the wife of the appellant, his conviction was affirmed by the Manitoba
Court of Appeal, unanimously as to ground (6), and with Prendergast and
Fullerton JJ.A. dissenting as to ground (a). These learned judges were
of the opinion that there was no evidence upon which the corroboration required
by s. 1002  of the Criminal Code , as amended by s. 26  of c. 38 of the
statutes of 1925, could be found:

1002. No person accused of an offence, etc.,
shall be convicted upon the evidence of one witness unless such witness is
corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.

Since the decision of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in R. v. Baskerville[1],
the requirements of the provision now found in s. 1002  admit of no doubt. The
corroboration must be by evidence independent of the complainant; and it

must tend to show that the accused committed
the crime charged.

The question we have to pass upon is whether
the record before us contains any evidence within that description, on which a
jury could find corroboration, Prendergast and Fullerton JJ.A., resting their
dissent on the proposition that such evidence is entirely lacking. That
question we regard as a question of law, although, no doubt, whether
corroborative inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury. R. v.
Gray[2]; S.
1024, Crim. Code, as enasted by s. 27 of c. 38 of the statutes of 1925.

Of most of the matters relied upon by the
Crown as implicating the accused, however, it cannot, in our opinion, be safely
predicated that they are in evidence independently of the testimony and conduct
of the complainant, or that, without her testimony, they “tend to show that the
accused committed the crime charged.” This defect affects everything in
connection with the alleged implication of the accused because of the admission
by him of the ownership and driving, on the morning in question, of the car
identified by the complainant as that in which she was taken to the scene of
the crime. While the verification of the details given by her no doubt adds to
the credibility

[Page 443]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[3] affirming, by a
majority, the conviction of the appellant by His Honour Judge Stacpoole, in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court, for the offence of carnally knowing a girl
under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 301  of the Criminal Code .

The complainant, the victim of the alleged
offence, stated in her evidence that, as she was on her way to the post office
at Lockport, the accused overtook her in a motor car, and offered to take her
to her destination, that she got in the car, that accused took her out of her
way and committed the offence on a road; that after the offence was committed
and as the accused was leaving her, she made a note of the plate number of the
car. She subsequently picked out the car, recognizing it, according to her
evidence, by its plate number and by a certain cushion on the seat. Evidence
from other sources was given to show that this, car belonged to the accused.
The complainant also picked out the accused, as the one who had committed the
offence, from a line of five men in the police office. After the complainant
had picked him out and left the office, the accused made a statement to the
police, which he immediately afterwards corrected by another statement, to show
his movements on the day the alleged offence was committed. He admitted he
owned a car with a plate number the same as that alleged by the complainant,
and that he was driving it on the day in question, but at Winnipeg, which is
nearly twenty miles from Lockport.

The question before the court on this appeal
was whether or not there was evidence upon which corroboration of the
complainant’s evidence, as required by s. 1002  of the Criminal Code , as
amended 1925, c. 38, s. 26 , could properly be found.

the appellant.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Aniglin C.J.C.—The appellant was convicted’, on the 7th of March, 1927, in
the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court, at Winnipeg, of an offence under s.
301 of the Crim-

[Page 445]

of the story she tells, everything in that
connection, including the admitted facte of ownership and driving (not at or
near the scene of the offence, but in and about Winnipeg) depends, for its
evidentiary value, upon her statement that a certain license number was that
carried by the car in which she was conveyed to the scene of the crime and her subsequent identification of a
cushion found in the car bearing that number. This is not, in a proper sense,
independent evidence tending to connect the accused with the crime. In
themselves these facte and circumstances merely “relate to the identity of the
accused without connecting him with the crime.” R. v. Baskerville[4]. They implicate the accused solely by reason of the complainant’s
statement as to the number of the car and her identification of the cushion in
it. Without this additional factor they are quite irrelevant. Nor can any
multiplication of such facts amount to corroboration. Thomas v. Jones[5]. They are all admissible only by reason of
the girl’s own story connecting them with the crime. They lack, therefore, the
essential quality of independence.

But there are in evidence certain other matters
which, according to the view to be taken of, and the inferences to be drawn
from, them by the tribunal of fact, may meet the requirements of s. 1002  of the
Criminal Code .

When the accused was first charged with the
offence by the constable who arrested him, so far as the record discloses he
made no reply to the charge which was read to him; again, when, at the police
station, he was identified by the complainant, who, going up to him, said:
“That is the man,” so far as the evidence shows, he made no denial in her
presence. But, almost immediately after she had gone away, he asked to make,
and made, a voluntary statement of his movements on the morning of the 20th of
July, when the crime is charged to have been committed. Scarcely had that
statement been signed by him when he said he had made a mistake and dictated a
second statement which he also signed. The manifest object of these two
statements was to show that during the material time he was in and about the
city of Winnipeg, 20 miles
distant

[Page 446]

from Lockport near which the crime was committed. Of these two statements the
learned Chief Justice of Manitoba says:

The first statement was to the effect that
he, the accused, was driving his car in Winnipeg and conversing with various
persons there at about the same time that the girl says he overtook her on the
road to Lockport, which is twenty miles away, and induced her to enter his car.
In the second statement, made immediately after the first, he gave a completely
different account as to his movements on the day in question: He says he went
in his car to his mother’s place in St. Boniface and stayed there until 10.30,
when he went to his sister’s place in the same city and she came back with him
to his mother’s; that he stayed there about fifteen minutes and then went home,
arriving there about noon.

These statements were clearly made for the
purpose of founding an alibi upon them. Probably, after he had made the first
statement, he feared that the persons he mentioned as in conversation with him
that forenoon might not support his statements. It would seem, therefore, that
he made the second statement in the expectation that his mother and sister
would assist him. However, no evidence for the defence was put in.

Mr. Justice Trueman, with whom Mr. Justice
Dennistoun concurred, says:

These statements carry nothing but
conviction that they are a tissue of lies. Each completely contradicts and
refutes the other. It is not necessary to examine or compare them in detail. In
the first statement there is no mention of visits to his mother and sister, to
whom, with his wife, the proof of the alibi is left by the second statement.
That both statements are false I have no doubt. That one is assuredly false
need alone be stated.

While the evidence is not explicit that the
appellant maintained silence when charged with the crime on his arrest and
again when confronted with and identified by the complainant, his conduct on
those occasions, so far as disclosed, and in voluntarily making the two
inconsistent statements referred to, was such that a jury might—and in this
case that the trial judge might—infer from it some acknowledgment of guilt.
Whether such inferences should be drawn is a question of fact.

As put by Lord Atkinson, in R. v. Christie[6]—where there was a question of the
admissibility of evidence of a statement made by the complainant (a boy of 5,
who testified without being sworn) in the presence of the accused, who was
charged with indecent assault—

As to the second ground, the rule of law
undoubtedly is that a statement made in the presence of an accused person, even
upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some
explanation or

[Page 447]

denial from him, is not evidence against
him of the facts stated, save so far as he accepts the statement, so as to make
it, in effect, his own. If he accepts the statement in part only, then to that
extent alone does it become his statement. He may accept the statement by word
or conduct, action or demeanour, and it is the function of the jury which tries
the case to determine whether his words, action, conduct, or demeanour at the
time when a statement was made amounts to an acceptance of it in whole or in
part. It by no means follows, I think, that a mere denial by the accused of the
facts mentioned in the statement necessarily renders the statement
inadmissible, because he may deny the statement in such a manner and under such
circumstances as may lead a jury to disbelieve him, and constitute evidence
from which an acknowledgment may be inferred by them.

Lord Moulton, in the same case, at pp. 559-560,
said:

It is common ground that, if on such an
occasion he admits it, evidence can be given of the admission and of what
passed on the occasion when it was made. It seems quite illogical that it
should be admissible to prove that the accused was charged with the crime if
his answer thereto was an admission, while it is not admissible to prove it
when his answer has been a denial of the crime, and I cannot agree that the
admissibility or non-admissibility is decided as a matter of law by any such
artificial rule. Going back to first principles as enunciated above, the
deciding question is whether the evidence of the whole occurrence is relevant
or not. If the prisoner admits the charge the evidence is obviously relevant. *
* * The evidential value of the occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of
the prisoner, for the fact that some one’ makes a statement to him subsequently
to the commission of the crime cannot in itself have any value as evidence for
or against him. The only evidence for or against him is his behaviour in
response to the charge, but I can see no justification for laying down as a
rule of law that any particular form of response, whether of a positive or
negative character, is such that it cannot in some circumstances have an
evidential value. I am, therefore, of opinion that there is no rule of law that
evidence cannot be given of the accused being charged with the offence and of
his behaviour on hearing such charge where that behaviour amounts to a denial
of his guilt.

Lord Reading, at pp. 563-4, said:

As to the second ground. A statement made
in the presence of one of the parties to a civil action may be given in
evidence against him if it is relevant to any of the matters in issue. And
equally such a statement made in the presence of the accused may be given in
evidence against him at his trial.

And he added, at pp. 565-6:

It might well be that the prosecution
wished to give evidence of such a statement in order to prove the conduct and
demeanour of the accused when hearing the statement as a relevant fact in the
particular case, notwithstanding that it did not amount either to an
acknowledgment or some evidence of an acknowledgment of any part of the truth
of the statement. I think it impossible to lay down any general rule to be
applied to all such cases, save the principle of strict law to which I have
referred.

[Page 448]

Mash v. Darley[7], was a case of bastardy. The defendant had
already been convicted of having had unlawful carnal knowledge of the
complainant. On his preliminary hearing preceding that conviction he had
deposed that the complainant was a fast girl and that that was the cause of her
condition. On his trial no such suggestion was made. The question was whether
proof of these facts could afford corroboration of the complainant’s story in
the bastardy case. Buckley L.J., said, at pp. 1230-1:

There are two matters, it seems to me,
which are plainly admissible evidence. The first is that the superintendent of
police said that he was present at the inquiry before the justices when the
appellant gave evidence which suggested that the respondent was a fast girl and
that that was the reason of her condition. That is admissible. The second is
that the superintendent of police was in Court during the trial at the assizes
and he says that no suggestion was then made by the appellant that the
respondent was a fast girl, nor did the appellant repeat the evidence on this
point, which he gave at the hearing of the charge before the justices in
August, 1912. That is admissible. Corroborative evidence, I conceive, may be
found either in admissions by the man or inferences properly drawn from the
conduct of the man. Admission here, there is none. Conduct there is. Were or
were not the justices entitled to take into account as a matter of evidence
upon which they might come to some conclusion the fact that the man before’ the
justices told a story, namely, that she was fast and that her condition was due
to that state of things, and the fact that when at the assizes he stood in
peril and when, if the defence was true, it was to his interest to set it
forward, he did not set it forward at all? It has been argued before us as if
he could not have set up that defence without going into the box and exposing
himself to cross-examination. It appears to me that’ that is a mistake. The
defence could have been set up in cross-examination of the girl when she was in
the box. Nothing of the kind was done. So, upon matters which are admissible in
evidence, it is established that the conduct of the man was this—that before
the justices he took a particular course and at a subsequent date he did not
take a particular course, and that that was a course which you would have
expected him to take under circumstances of his innocence. It is not for us to
say what weight ought to be given to that evidence. All that we have to look at
is to see whether there was evidence. If there was evidence, it is not for us
but for the justices to determine whether or not that was evidence which
satisfied them. It appears to me that that was corroborative evidence and that
the justices were entitled to take into account that the man so conducted
himself as that there was reason from his conduct to infer that the girl’s
story was presumably true. It appears to me that that disposes of this case.

Kennedy, L.J., said, at p. 1234:

I also agree that there may be cases in
which language, whether used in a Court of justice or outside a Court of
Justice, may be considered as having the effect of corroboration, although
there is nothing like an express admission. There may be such cases.

[Page 449]

Phillimore L.J., also thought the evidence
admissible and such as the justices might act upon.

In the case of R. v. Feigenbaum[8], the Court of Criminal Appeal dealt with
the question of corroboration in a case where the appellant had been convicted
of inciting boys to steal. The boys were accomplices and their evidence,
therefore, could not safely be relied upon unless corroborated.

Darling J., delivering the judgment of the Court
of Criminal Appeal (Darling, Avory and Shearman JJ.), said, at pp. 433-434:

In this case the deputy-chairman rightly
directed the jury as to the danger of believing the uncorroborated evidence of
the accomplices, and as to what was, or might be, corroboration; and, in our
opinion, it would, in the circumstances of this case, have been wrong for him
to say that in his opinion there was no corroboration of the boys’ evidence.
What had happened was this. After the boys had been arrested, and statements
implicating the appellant had been made by them to the police, a police officer
went to the appellant’s house. He gave the appellant specific information as to
the names of the boys, as to what they had told the police, and as to the
charge against them. The appellant did not make any reply to the statement of
the police officer. We are of opinion that, in these circumstances, it would be
wrong to say that there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the
boys’ evidence had been corroborated. The deputy-chairman quite properly
pointed out to the jury that the failure of the appellant to make any reply to
the statement of the police officer might, having regard to the nature of the
statement and to the circumstances in which it was made, be considered as being
a corroboration of the boys’ evidence, that it was for the jury to consider
whether in their opinion it did, or did not, amount to corroboration, and, if
they thought it did, it was for them to say whether they thought there was
sufficient evidence on which to convict the appellant.

Mr. Justice Avory had been a member of the Court
of Criminal Appeal in the case of R. v. Baskerville
(supra)[9] and was also the
dissenting judge in the Divisional Court in Thomas v. Jones[10],
whose judgment was afterwards approved in the reversing judgment of the Court
of Appeal[11].

We are of the opinion that, if the conduct of
the appellant when arrested and again when identified by the complainant and in
making the two inconsistent statements had been found by the trial judge to be
corroborative of the story of the complainant, the conviction before us could
not have been set aside.

[Page 450]

Unfortunately, however, the trial judge appears
not to have considered this evidence or passed upon its sufficiency. In
pronouncing judgment against the appellant he said:

The evidence I regard as corroborative is
contained in the statement of the accused whereby he admits the ownership of
the car. The little girl claims that car was out there, and that was the car
she was conveyed in to where the offence took place. The accused admits the
ownership of the car, and that is a corroboration on a material point
implicating the accused.

For reasons already indicated we are unable to
agree with this view of the learned judge.

There is no finding by the trial judge as to the
inference to be drawn from the conduct of the accused, already adverted to, nor
any adjudication that it affords the requisite corroboration. We cannot,
without usurping the exclusive function of the tribunal of fact, make such an
adjudication.

This case does not fall within the saving
operation of s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code  (13 and 14 Geo. V, c. 41,
s. 9). On the other hand the circumstances do not seem to call for an
unqualified order quashing the conviction and directing the discharge of the
appellant. While of the opinion that the ruling of the trial judge was erroneous
and has resulted in a mistrial, we think that,

having regard to the nature of the offence
and the circumstances under which * * * it was committed, the present case is
one in which the discretion (conferred by s. 1018—now s. 1014 (3)—of the Criminal
Code ) should be exercised in such manner as to afford the Crown an
opportunity of once more putting the law in motion * * * if it thinks fit to do
so.

R. v. Burr[12].

The conviction, therefore, should be set aside
and a new trial directed.

Conviction set aside and new trial
ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Evidence—Unsworn
testimony of child of tender years—Necessity of inquiry by trial judge before
admitting evidence—Admission in evidence of statement by accused—Proof of its
voluntary character—Questioning of accused by police—Necessity of disclosure of
process leading to accused's statement.

Before receiving the unsworn
testimony of a child of tender years, under s. 16  of the Canada Evidence
Act , the presiding judge should ascertain by appropriate methods whether or
not the child understands

 [Page 437]

the nature of an oath; to do
this is quite as much his duty as it is to satisfy himself of the child's
intelligence and appreciation of the duty of speaking the truth; on both points
alike he is required to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with
discretion, to be exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. Of no
ordinary child over seven years of age can it be safely predicated, from his
mere appearance, that he does not understand the nature of an oath. A very
brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on the point But some inquiry is
indispensable.

The Court (reversing judgment
of the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia [1927] 2 W.W.R. 265) quashed a
conviction for murder and granted a new trial, on the ground that the unsworn
testimony of a child ten years old was improperly received (Allen v. The
King 44 Can. S.C.R. 331 cited), there being no material before the judge on
which he could properly base an opinion that the child did not understand the
nature of an oath.

Questioning of an accused by
police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se
render the accused's statement inadmissible. But the burden of establishing to
the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or
statement procured from accused while under arrest was voluntary, always rests
with the Crown (The King v. Bellos, [1927] S.C.R. 258; Prosko
v. The King, 63 Can. S.C.R. 226). That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged
merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary
warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer who obtained
it, that it was made freely and voluntarily; what took place in the process by
which the statement was ultimately obtained should be fully disclosed; and,
with all the facts before him, the judge should form his own opinion that the
tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary, before admitting it in
evidence.

APPEAL from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] sustaining, by a majority, the conviction of the
appellant, on his trial before D. A. McDonald J. and a jury, on a charge of
murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on
the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the judgment
now reported. The appeal was allowed; the conviction was quashed, and a new
trial ordered.

O. M. Biggar K.C. and J.
Edward Bird for the appellant.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. and A.
M. Johnson K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was
delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The defendant
appeals to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing his appeal from a conviction for murder.

[Page 438]

The opinion of the majority of
the court (Macdonald C.J.A., Galliher and Macdonald JJ.A.) was delivered by the
Chief Justice. A direction given by the court, pursuant to ss. 5  of s. 1013  of
the Criminal Code , allowing the delivery of separate judgments, is
embodied in the formal judgment dismissing the appeal. Dissenting opinions were
accordingly delivered by Martin and McPhillips JJ.A., who would have directed a
new trial.

Five distinct grounds of appeal,
based on the judgment of McPhillips J.A., were taken by the appellant:

1. Insufficiency of the evidence
to warrant a conviction;

2. Mis-direction of the jury by
the learned trial judge;

3. Rejection by the Court of
Appeal of a motion by the defendant for the reception of further evidence;

4. Wrongful admission of the
unsworn testimony of Haldis Sandahl, a child aged ten years;

5. Wrongful admission of a
statement procured by the police from the accused while under arrest, because
its voluntary character had not been established.

Mr. Justice Martin's dissent
rests solely on the ground last mentioned.

When the child, Sandahl, was
called as a witness the record shews what occurred as follows:

HALDIS SANDAHL, a witness
called on behalf of the Crown, testified as follows:

Mr. JOHNSON: I think that if
you put her in a chair in the box; we haven't a high chair. This child, my
lord, is of tender years, nine years old and I tender her evidence under the
provisions of section 16  of the Canada Evidence Act .

Mr. PATMORE: I understand
that this is because this child does not understand the nature of an oath.

Mr. JOHNSON: That is for the
judge to satisfy himself.

The COURT: Q. Where do you
live, Haldis?—A. Port Essington.

Q. See how loudly you can
speak. How old are you?—A. Eight—ten.

Q. And what is your daddy's
name?—A. Mr. Sandahi.

Q. What does he do, does he
live up there?—A. Yes.

Q. And your mother, does she
live with you too?—A. Yes.

Q. You go to school?—A. Yes.

Q. Can you read a little
bit?—A. Yes.

Q. And write your own name?—A.
Yes.

Q. Do you know that it is
very bad for little girls to tell lies?—A. Yes.

Q. Did they tell you that
little girls must never tell stories? Do you understand that?—A. Yes.

Q. You must always tell the
truth?—A. Yes.

[Page 439]

Q. We want you to answer the
questions these men ask you and be sure to tell the truth.

The witness then proceeded to
give unsworn testimony, which covered ground as to identification most vital to
the interest of the defendant.

S. 16  of the Canada Evidence
Act  reads as follows:

16. In any legal proceeding
where a child of tender years is offered as a witness, and such child does not,
in the opinion of the judge, justice, or other presiding officer, understand
the nature of an oath, the evidence of such child may be received, though not
given on oath, if, in the opinion of the judge, justice, or other presiding
officer, as the case may be, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence
to ju<?> the reception of the evidence, and understands the duty of
speaking the truth.

2. No case shall be decided
upon such evidence alone, and such evidence must be corroborated by some other
material evidence.

The only light thrown by the
record on the view taken by the learned trial judge as to the scope of his
function in regard to determining whether the girl, Sandahl, understood the
nature of an oath is found in his charge to the jury when he said:

The little girl Haldis
Sandahl, she was ten years old last February, and as you noticed when the
question came up the law provides that if a child is called as a witness in any
case, if the judge thinks the child is not old enough to understand the nature
of an oath she can give evidence. Then when it is given, that evidence has
exactly the same weight as any other evidence, subject to this, and then
provides that on that evidence alone you must have other evidence with it. ***

The learned judge made no inquiry
as to the capacity or education of the girl in regard to her comprehension of
the meaning, effect and sanction of an oath, presumably because, from her
appearance, he thought her ""not old enough to understand the nature of an
oath."" She was tendered by the Crown as a witness whose evidence could be
received under s. 16  of the Canada Evidence Act ; and, apparently because
no objection was taken by counsel for the prisoner, she was allowed to give her
evidence unsworn, the learned trial judge having first satisfied himself by apt
questions that "" she (was) possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify
the reception of her evidence and (understood) the duty of speaking the
truth.""

Now it is quite as much the duty
of the presiding judge to ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a
child offered as a witness does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath,
as it is to satisfy himself of the intelligence of 

[Page 440]        

such child and his appreciation
of the duty of speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the
statute to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be
exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term ""child of
tender years"" is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age
can it be safely predicated, from his mere appearance, that he does not
understand the nature of an oath. Such a child may be convicted of crime. Crim.
Code, sections 17-18. A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge
on this point. But some inquiry would seem to be indispensable. The opinion of
the judge, so formed, that the child does not understand the nature of an oath
is made by the statute a pre-requisite to the reception in evidence of his
unsworn testimony. With the utmost respect, in our opinion there was, in this
instance, no material before the judge on which he could properly base such an
opinion. He apparently misconceived the duty in this regard imposed upon him by
the statute.

The unsworn testimony of Haldis
Sandahl was, we think, improperly received. Its importance is not questioned.
It may well have been the deciding factor which led the jury to the conclusion
that identification of the defendant as the person guilty of the murder in question
was sufficiently established. The case falls clearly within the decision of
this Court in Allen v. The King[2].

The conviction must, therefore,
be quashed and a new trial ordered.

We feel, however, that we should
not part from this case without expressing our view that the proof of the
voluntary character of the accused's statement to the police, which was put in
evidence against him, is most unsatisfactory. That statement, put in writing by
the police officer, was obtained only upon a fourth questioning to which the
accused was subjected on the day following his arrest. Three previous attempts
to lead him to ""talk"" had apparently proved abortive—why, we are left
to surmise. The accused, a young Indian, could neither read nor write. No
particulars are vouchsafed as to what transpired at any of the three previous
""interviews""; and but meagre details are

[Page 441]

given of the process by which the
written statement ultimately signed by the appellant was obtained. We think
that the police officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed
all that took place on each of the occasions when he ""interviewed""
the prisoner; and, if another policeman was present, as the defendant swore at
the trial, his evidence should have been adduced before the statement was
received in evidence. With all the facts before him, the learned judge should
form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary
as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the
police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made "" voluntarily and
freely.""

It should always be borne in mind
that while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if
properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render
his statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to
the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or
statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always
rests with the Crown. The King v. Bellos[3]
; Prosko v. The King[4].
That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving
of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of
opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely
and voluntarily.

The place at which the next trial
shall be held is in the discretion of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, to
which, if so advised, the accused may make application for a change of venue.

Appeal allowed, and new
trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
 ALBERTA

Criminal law—Strike—Picketing—Besetting and watching
""wrongfully and without lawful authority""—Section 501 (f) Cr. C.

[Page 499]

By s. 501 (f) of the Criminal Code  everyone is guilty
of an offence who ""wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to
compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful
right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain * *
* besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or
works or carries on business or happens to be.""

The conviction of defendant thereunder for conduct in the
""picketing"" of coal mining premises in the course of a strike by
certain mine workers, which conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Clarke J.A. dissenting), was affirmed by the
Supreme Court of Canada, which held that there was evidence at the trial that
the besetting and watching in which defendant was engaged was ""wrongful
and without lawful authority"" within the meaning of the section.

Defendant's acts were wrongful and unlawful if the besetting
and watching in which he, in common with his comrades or associates, was
engaged, amounted to a nuisance or a trespass, or if the men who were besetting
and watching constituted an unlawful assembly, and the conduct in question
(discussed in the judgments) afforded evidence of each of these particulars.

While apparently the hill occupied by the party to which the
defendant belonged was somewhat outside the mining property, the hills
surrounding the mine in other directions belonged to the mine owners and the
groups stationed there were trespassers, and since the picketing was carried on
in pursuance of a common design or project to which all the strikers including
defendant were parties, he must be held responsible for the trespasses equally
with those who actually occupied the mine owners' property.

Per Idington J.: The section clearly forbids anyone from
besetting another's house or place of business with a view to compel him to
abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do. Such an act,
which at common law might be the basis of a civil action, was always at common
law wrongful, and is in itself ""wrongful and without lawful
authority"" within the meaning of the section unless some lawful authority
(e.g., as often there might be with a sheriff, etc.) exists.

[Page 500]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming (Clarke J. A. dissenting) the conviction of
defendant under s. 501  (f)
of the Criminal Code  on a charge of wrongfully and without lawful authority
besetting and watching the mine of a certain coal mining company with a view to
compel the company to abstain from engaging or employing or continuing in its
employment miners and employees other than those belonging to a certain trade
union to which the defendant belonged. The charge is set out in full in the
judgment of Idington J.

C. C. Robinson, K.C. and H. A. F. Boyde for the
appellant.

W. S.
Gray and J. J. Frawley for the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and
Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by

NEWCOMBE J.—The appellant, with five others, was charged
in two counts, under section 501  (f)
of the Criminal Code , with the offence of wrongfully and without lawful
authority besetting and watching the mine of the Alberta Block Coal Company,
Limited, where the company carried on its business, with a view to compel the
company to abstain from engaging or employing, or continuing in its employ,
miners or employees other than those belonging to a trade union, known as the
Red Deer Valley Miners' Union, to which the accused belonged. It will be
convenient to set out the material part of the section, which is as follows:—

S. 501  (f): Every one is guilty of an offence
punishable, at the option of the accused, on indictment or on summary
conviction before two justices, and liable on conviction to a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars, or to three months' imprisonment with or without
hard labour, who, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to
compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful
right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain

****

(f) besets or watches the house or other place where
such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be.

[Page 501]

The case has been tried twice. At the
first trial there was a jury, and all the accused were convicted, but upon
appeal the conviction was set aside upon purely legal grounds, as we are
informed, and, at the new trial, the accused, other than the appellant, pleaded
guilty, and the latter, electing to be tried without a jury, was tried before
McCarthy J., and again convicted. From this conviction he appealed to the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, where the appeal was heard
and the conviction upheld by the judgment of the court, pronounced by the Chief
Justice. Clarke J. however dissented, the court considering it convenient that
his judgment should be pronounced separately, and it is the question of law
involved in his dissent that is now presented upon the appeal to this court.

The Alberta Block Coal Company of Drumheller, in the Province of
 Alberta, belonged to an association of coal operators which negotiated an
agreement with the executive of the United Mine Workers of America regulating
working conditions, including the rate of wages to be paid to the miners. This
agreement went into operation, but was subsequently amended by the parties in a
manner to effect a reduction of 15% in the rates stipulated. The reduced rates
were not acceptable to the majority of the Company's employees, and became the
cause or occasion for a strike. The striking miners belonged to the Union of
the United Mine Workers of America; they were dissatisfied with the reduction
of the rates to which the executive of their union had agreed, and in
consequence they decided to withdraw from it, and to set up a new union, which
is known in the case as the Red Deer Valley Miners Union. Some of the company's
employees however did not join in the agitation, but continued to work for the
company as formerly, and the strikers established what they call pickets at the
mine with a view, as they say, peacefully to persuade the miners who adhered to
the company's service to cease work.

The locality of the mine is not as clearly described by the
transcript of the evidence produced as might be desired, but there is in proof
a plan of a limited area, and some of the witnesses give descriptions from
which it would appear that the mine is situated in a narrow valley or coulee
bordered by hills of considerable height, about 100 ft. to

[Page 502]

150 ft. above the level. The shaft is
sunk on the property of the company, and in the neighbourhood is a power house,
machine shop, wash house, offices, some dwelling houses and outbuildings, and,
a few hundred feet distant, a store house and powder house. These buildings are
all upon the property of the company, which is approached from the north by a
waggon road, and by a railway spur or siding from the line of the Canadian
National Railways. The disturbances began on 23rd June, 1925, and the offence is charged to have been committed between the 22nd and 27th days of June. The
evidence is however directed particularly to the occurrences on the night of
the 25th and the early morning of the 26th. On the 23rd a large delegation of
the strikers went to the mine and there was some discussion. McDonald, who was
one of them, says that they found men there wearing their working clothes and
carrying their lunch buckets and he talked with several of these men about
quitting work, but that they were not prepared to quit and went down to the
mine. The following information is elicited from him:

A. I spoke to about ten or eleven, they were in line.
Thomson and Fernet, I think I remember them all right, I don't remember the
others.

Q. These men apparently were not on the 23rd prepared to
quit work and join your union, is that right?

A. On the 23rd, they went down to the mine on the 23rd.

Q. They listened to your representations and then they
decided to work, is not that the situation, or rather continue work?

A. Oh yes, they did, because, naturally enough, their boss,
Jesse Gouge, who was standing there over them, and he tried to drive me away
and I insisted I wanted to speak to the men and talk to them.

Q. You had the opportunity to speak to them?

A. Yes, I spoke to them.

The pickets were divided into groups and took their positions at
places convenient for their purpose about the mine, from whence they continued
to watch and beset the premises for several days. At night they occupied the
hills surrounding the mine and overlooking the avenues of approach. Here they
lighted wood fires which were kept burning throughout the night, and about
which the men gathered, and where they were relieved at intervals. Inspector
Nicholson of the provincial police, who was stationed at Drumheller, says:

Q. You have told us that these men had
a smudge or fire there?

A. Yes.

[Page 503]

Q. And that there were other smudges or fires on
neighbouring hills around?

A. Yes.

Q. Were these hills around the A.B.C. Mine?

A. They practically surrounded it, yes.

He says, moreover, that:

A. These men were on the different hills in bunches of
individuals and each bunch or crowd on each hill had a fire, a little bonfire
or smudge. One of these hills was immediately behind the buildings at the A.B.C.
premises, that would be immediately north. On account of a complaint received
earlier on the 25th and on account of noises which I had heard in the vicinity
of a powder house belonging to the A.B.C. Mine on the night of the 25th, I
decided to remove the men on this particular hill that I speak of.

Asked whether there was any means of communication between the
various parties on the hills, the witness answers that

they continued to shout to one
another from one hill to another. One party would shout to one hill and it
would be answered, and the call would go practically round all of the crowd.

Inspector Nicholson sent three of his
constables at about, or shortly after, midnight of the 25th, to occupy separate
positions along the roadway at the foot of the hill immediately to the north.
When these constables, or two of them, were perceived by the men on the top,
they were greeted with insult, curses and threats. They made no response, but
remained in their respective positions, and immediately afterwards five of
those on the top were taken into custody by Inspector Nicholson and other
constables who had approached under cover of the darkness from the rear. The
appellant however ran down the hill where he stoned one of the constables
stationed below, who pursued him calling upon him to stand, and was arrested
after he had been wounded by a shot from the constable. During the night
previous to the coming of the police, there had been ten or fifteen men upon
this particular hill, but apparently the six men charged were the only ones
there at the time of the arrest.

The trial judge, in convicting the appellant, delivered a
somewhat lengthy judgment. He referred to the cases of Reg. v. Hibbert[2],
and Reg. v. Bauld[3]. He
said that in his view the conduct of the accused and the men with

[Page 504]

whom he was associated went far beyond
the conduct of the men concerned in these cases, and that

I cannot look on his conduct as
peaceful picketing, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances and
certainly the conduct was such as to operate in the mind of the men who were
going to work and to operate on the mind of the operators as to whether or not
to carry on the work in the mine.

The learned Chief Justice, pronouncing the judgment of the
Appellate Division, relied upon J. Lyons & Sons v. Wilkins[4],
and the same case, as reported upon appeal after the trial[5],
and he considered the case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative
Printers' Assistants' Society[6], which,
it had been argued, was not in complete accord with the Lyons Case. In
conclusion, however, he said that

a picketing effected in the way this
was—to constitute a menace and practical compulsion by moral force, even if no
physical force were contemplated, as to which one might have doubts, would not
be such a picketing as would be warranted and, therefore, would be wrongful.

He quoted the finding of the learned
trial judge and he said

with this finding, which in my
opinion, is quite justified, the case does not seem to fall within the
qualifications suggested in the Ward, Lock Case (3).

Clarke J., the dissenting judge, agreed

that the defendant should be held
responsible as one of the watching and besetting party, engaged in what is
commonly called picketing, and that he, with the others charged, did, with a
view to compel another person to abstain from doing something which he had a
lawful right to do, or to do something from which he had a lawful right to
abstain, beset or watch the place where such other person works or carries on
business within the meaning of s. 501  (f).

But he found difficulty in saying that
such picketing was wrongful or without lawful authority; or, as he puts it,
""in other words that peaceful picketing is wrongful"". He reviewed the
evidence, as to which he appears to take a view more favourable to the
appellant than that which seems to be held by the majority of the court. He
said that the Ward, Lock Case (3) as applied in the later case of Fowler
v. Kibble[7], seems
to cast considerable doubt upon the correctness of the decision in the Lyons
Case (2) and therefore he concluded, adopting what he takes to be the
result of the Ward, Lock Case (3), that the element of wrongfulness is
lacking in the present case, and he would therefore allow the appeal.

[Page 505]

In view of the nature of the dissent and seeing that the
jurisdiction of this court in criminal appeals is limited to questions of law,
which are the subject of difference below, the point which this court has now
to determine is in reality whether there was evidence at the trial that the watching
and besetting in which the appellant was engaged was wrongful and without
lawful authority. Upon this point I entertain no doubt.

In the Lyons Case [8] the
Court of Appeal upon both occasions considered the interpretation of s. 7,
subs. 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, c. 86 of 1875, which
corresponds, with unimportant variations, with s. 501  (f) of the
Criminal Code , upon which the present charge is laid. It is explained by the
concluding clause of s. 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act that

attending at or near the house or
place where a person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to
be, or the approach to such house or place, in order merely to obtain or
communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the
meaning of this section.

But this clause is not embodied in the
Criminal Code , and for that reason, as well as because of the facts in proof,
it has no application to the case now under review.

The Master of the Rolls (Lord Justice Lindley) considered that to
watch and beset in order to compel caused a nuisance, and he found upon the
evidence that there was a nuisance. But in the Ward, Lock Case [9]
Moulton L.J. was of the opinion that there might be a sort of compulsion which
would not be wrongful or illegal and therefore that the conclusion of the
Master of the Rolls was too broad; he did not however deny its application to
the particular case which the Master of the Rolls had in hand, and these great
judges were in perfect agreement that it was necessary to establish, in one way
or another, that the watching and besetting was done wrongfully and without
legal authority.

In the Ward Lock Case (2) the defendant had stationed
pickets to watch the plaintiffs' printing works for the purpose of inducing the
workmen employed by the plaintiffs to join the union, and then to determine
their employment by proper notices, the object being thereby to compel the
plaintiffs to become employers of union men, and to ab-

[Page 506]

stain from employing non-union men; the
report states that this was carried out without causing, by violence,
obstruction or otherwise, a common law nuisance. Moulton L.J. said, as
reported:—

In my view that which decides the
question is that there is no evidence of any improper or illegal acts, or,
indeed, of any acts whatever, by any of the pickets sent by the defendants * *
*. I wish to add that, in my opinion, there is throughout a complete absence of
evidence of anything in the nature of picketing or besetting which could
constitute a nuisance. It appears that the discharged workmen loitered about
for a day or two after leaving work, a thing which is not unlikely to happen,
and that they were at times joined by others, but there is no suggestion even
by the plaintiffs' witnesses that any annoyance or molestation took place, and
the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.

He referred to the fact that, at the
request of the plaintiffs, the police had placed special patrols outside their
premises during the period of the dispute, but that none of the police had been
called as witnesses by the plaintiffs, and that the inspector and a sergeant,
called by the defendants, had shown that there was nothing which could give any
ground for complaint. This decision is referred to and followed as an important
one in Fowler v. Kibble[10], but, for the purposes of the present
case it decides no more than I think was decided by the Master of the Rolls in
the Lyons Case[11]. The
judgments concur in the view that watching or besetting, if carried on in a
manner to create a nuisance, is at common law wrongful and without legal
authority. In the Lyons Case (2) the Court of Appeal found the
essential facts to constitute a common law nuisance. In the Ward Lock Case [12]
they found that the sort of picketing there in proof afforded no evidence of a
nuisance, and these cases do not really assist in the determination of the
present question, which depends upon its own facts, except in so far as they
affirm, what is evident by the statute itself, that if picketing foe carried on
in a manner to create a nuisance, or otherwise unlawfully, it constitutes an
offence within the meaning of the statute.

Coming now again to the facts in the present case, the acts with
which the appellant is charged were wrongful and unlawful if the watching and
besetting in which he, in common with his comrades or associates, was engaged
amounted to a nuisance or to a trespass, or if the men who

[Page 507]

were watching and besetting constituted
an unlawful assembly, and there is evidence as to each of these particulars
which ought not to be overlooked.

There was a large number of men engaged; a crowd was assembled at
the Atlas crossing to the north of the company's works; pickets in considerable
numbers were stationed at every avenue of approach; they remained in position
with reliefs uninterruptedly by night as well as by day; they lighted fires on
hilltops surrounding the mine, shouting back and forth from one group to
another. On one occasion at the very entrance to the mine one of these men,
according to his own testimony, insisted upon his endeavour to persuade
workmen, who were there in their working clothes and with their lunch baskets,
from going into the mine, notwithstanding that their foreman was present and
tried to drive him away.

To the southeast of the shaft and the power house at a distance
of about 800 feet is the powder house, situated in a narrow spur or offshoot of
the coulee to the southward of the railway. This building is at the base of one
of the surrounding hills, and if, as Inspector Nicholson testifies, the hills
on which the fires were lighted practically surrounded the mine, some of them
must have been very near to the powder house. He tells us that crowds of men
continued on these hills throughout the whole of the 25th from seven o'clock in the morning, and that it was because of a complaint and noises which he
heard in the vicinity of the powder house that he decided to remove the men
from the hilltops. He says he intended to remove ""all these different
crowds of men,"" but to begin at the particular hill where he found the
appellant. It will, of course, be realized that, as these hills were at
considerable distances, the shouting from one hill to another must have been
vociferous, and moreover the danger of open wood fires in the neighbourhood of
the powder house and other buildings of the company was in itself a cause for
apprehension.

Now while apparently the hill which was occupied by the party to
which the appellant belonged was somewhat to the northward of the northern
limit of the company's property, the hills surrounding the mine in other
directions belonged to the company and the groups stationed there were
trespassers, and, since the picketing was so carried

[Page 508]

on in pursuance of a common design or
project to which all the strikers including the appellant were parties, he must
be held responsible for the trespasses equally with those who actually occupied
the company's property.

Moreover, while it is explained, with remarkable agreement on the
part of the striking miners, that the purpose of their assembly at and about
the mine was peacefully to endeavour to persuade the miners who continued to
work to quit the service of the company and to join the new union, in order, as
it is said, to maintain the standard of living, the character and purpose of
this assembly is, I think, better evidenced by its acts and course of conduct
than by the statements of its members as to what their intention was; and the
numbers of men who assembled, their distribution about the premises, including
the company's property, their attendance there by day and by night, the fires,
the shouting, their reception of the police, their threats and conduct when the
police approached, afford cogent evidence, not only of a nuisance, but also of
an unlawful assembly, Hawkins Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed., Bk. 1, c. 28, ss. 4,
5 and 9; Reg. v. Vincent[13]; Reg.
v. Neale[14].

It is not for this court to judge the evidence, except to
determine whether there be any. The appellants case fails if evidence be found
which the trial judge was bound to consider tending to shew that the watching
and besetting, which is conclusively found to have taken place, was wrongful
and without lawful authority, and I think there is such evidence in each of the
aspects to which I have referred.

It was suggested also that the pickets were endeavouring to
induce the company's workmen to break their contracts of service, but the
evidence does not, in my opinion, go far enough to justify a finding that there
were such contracts.

I would dismiss the appeal.

IDINGTON J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta maintaining the conviction
of the appellant who was tried before Mr. Justice McCarthy without a jury and found
guilty of the following charges laid against him and five others, that is to
say that they did at Newcastle in the Judicial District of Calgary

[Page 509]

between the 22nd and the 27th days
of June, 1925, wrongfully and without lawful authority with a view to
compelling another person, The Alberta Block Coal Company Limited, a body
corporate, to abstain in the carrying on of its business from engaging or
employing or continuing in its employment miners and employees other than those
belonging to the Red Deer Valley Miners Union, or to such union as the
defendants themselves belonged. The Alberta Block Coal Company Limited then
having a lawful right to engage or employ or continue in its employment miners
or employees without restriction as to their membership in the union or unions
aforesaid, or to compel the said company to engage and employ and continue in
its employment only such miners and employees as belonged to said union, which
members the said company had a lawful right to abstain from employing, did
beset and watch the place where the said company carries on business, to wit:
the mining premises of the said company.

And further stand charged that they at the same time and
place wrongfully and without lawful authority with a view to compel Tom Fernet,
William Hopkins, Joseph Thompson, Robert Brownell, and others, to abstain from
doing what they had a lawful right to do, to wit: to work for the Alberta Block
Coal Company Limited, did beset and watch the place where the said Tom Fernet,
William Hopkins, Joseph Thompson, Robert Brownell and others worked, to wit:
the premises of the Alberta Block Coal Company Limited's mine.

The accused parties had been tried before Mr. Justice Boyle with
a jury and found guilty but for some reason or other a new trial was directed.

The others then pleaded guilty but the present appellant elected
to be tried before Mr. Justice McCarthy without a jury.

The said charges were laid under section 501 , subs. (f) of
the Criminal Code .

The said section 501  reads as follows:—

501. Every one is guilty of an offence punishable, at the
option of the accused, on indictment or on summary conviction before two
justices and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars,
or to three months imprisonment with or without hard labour, who, wrongfully
and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain
from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from
which he has a lawful right to abstain,

(a) uses
violence to such other person, or his wife or children, or injures his
property; or

(b) intimidates such other person, or his wife or
children, by threats of using violence to him, her or any of them, or of
injuring his property; or,

(c) persistently follows such other person about from
place to place; or,

(d) hides
any tools, clothes or other property owned or used by such other person, or
deprives him of, or hinders him in, the use thereof; or,

(e) with one or more other persons, follows such
other person, in a disorderly manner, in or through any street or road; or,

[Page 510]

(f) besets or watches the house or other place where
such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be.
55-56 V, c. 29. s. 523; 4-5 Ed VII, c. 9,s. 3.

The essential parts thereof to be considered herein are the
following lines:—

who, wrongfully and without lawful
authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing
anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has
a lawful right to abstain, * * *

(f) besets or watches the house or other place where
such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be.

This seems to me a clear and explicit expression in plain English
forbidding anyone from besetting another's house or place of business with a
view to compel him to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right
to do.

Each of the preceding subsections from (a) to (e)
inclusive, implies violence or improper conduct towards another of some kind
for which the party so doing might be punishable otherwise in law. But there is
no such necessary implication in simply watching a house.

These men were, clearly as noon-day, doing what the subsection (f)
forbids, unless in the case of one having lawful authority to beset or watch.
For example, the sheriff or his officers often have lawful authority to go very
far in discharging their duty—even to the extent of besetting or watching a
house. No pretence of authority is shewn here. None existed. Indeed the accused
were in fact trespassers, I imagine, on the property of the coal company. And
surely the company in question carrying on business in and on the premises in
question, had a perfect right to refuse to employ men belonging to the Red Deer
Valley Miners' Union.

And can there be a shadow of doubt that the men taking part in
the besetting and watching complained of were doing so with a view to compel
said company to abstain from pursuing their business without the aid of workmen
belonging to the said Red Deer Union.

Compel is a word of various shades of meaning, for
example, the Century Dictionary gives some five different shades, but let us
select no. 1, which read's as follows:—

1. To drive or urge with force or irresistibly; constrain;
oblige; coerce, by either physical or moral force: as, circumstances compel us
to practise economy.

[Page 511]

Or, let us turn to Murray's New English Dictionary, and we find a
different application of it and select no. 2 b, which reads as follows:—

b. To constrain (an action); to bring about by force,
constraint or moral necessity; to exact by rightful claim; to demand.

Surely either one or other of these expressions can be acted upon
herein, and was intended to be acted upon and applied in cases such as herein
presented if we leave aside all other features than the proof of besetting and
watching.

It does not in either necessarily imply physical violence as the
means of compulsion.

Ever since the effect of said section as it appeared in the
R.S.C. 1886, was changed by dropping subs. 2 of s. 12 of c. 173, in which the
words were as follows:—

2. Attending at or near or approaching to such house or
other place as aforesaid, in order merely to obtain or communicate information,
shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.

the law has been simplified and I
respectfully submit made clear.

On the other hand in the English Act from which in its original
state our Act was first taken there was a provision very similar to the said
section 2, almost identical, which continued part of the English Act and hence
renders English cases turning thereon (save and except Lyons v. Wilkins[15],
I am about to refer to) of very little service to any Canadian case since our
Criminal Code  of 1892 was framed and, as already stated, the above quoted
section dropped out.

In 1906 the English Trades Disputes Act was passed and
distinctly enacted as follows, in the second section thereof:—

It shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their
own behalf or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm
in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a
house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or
happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining
or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or
abstain from working.

Other provisions of the same Act tended still more to render it
impossible to make any English case such as herein in question of any helpful
service.

[Page 512]

I must also say that a criminal intent and object might well be
suspected in much presented to us in the evidence but as I understand the
ground of Mr. Justice Clarke's dissent, which is the ambit of our jurisdiction
herein, it is quite unnecessary to enter into that feature of this case to
which I have just referred.

In the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke, so far as dissenting, he
makes clear what he means as follows:—

I think the real difficulty in this case consists in the
interpretation of the words in s. 501  ""wrongfully and without lawful
authority.""

I agree that the defendant should be held responsible as one
of the watching and besetting party engaged in what is commonly called
picketing and that he with the others charged did with a view to compel another
person to abstain from doing something which he had a lawful right to do or to
do something from which he had a lawful right to abstain, beset or watch the
place where such other person works or carries on business within the meaning
of s. 501  (f) but my difficulty is in saying that such picketing is wrongful
and without lawful authority, or in other words that peaceful picketing is
wrongful.

If it is not wrongful then, in my opinion, the conviction
cannot be supported upon the evidence. There is no evidence that during the
night when the conduct of the defendant is complained of there was any
interference with either the mining company or its workmen, or any violence,
intimidation or threats; Lewis McDonald was called as a Crown witness and the
trial judge states the situation upon which he apparently bases his judgment as
follows: ""Lewis McDonald in his evidence tells us that the so-called
Canadian Union proposed to picket the A.B.C. Mine to tell the miners it was
their duty to try to persuade the mine workers not to go to work so as to not
reduce the standard of living. He testifies that during the time the accused
and others were picketing the A.B.C. Mine he was on the picket during the 23rd
and on the morning of the 24th of June, 1925. The purpose of the picket was to
interview the men employed in the A.B.C. Mine and persuade them not to go to
work. He admitted interviewing some of them himself. Cecil Terris, in his
evidence, says they were supposed to go down to the mine and if they met
anybody going down to work to ask them to join the new union. * * * So that
apparently the accused were there to persuade the miners not to go to work or
to prevent the A.B.C. Company from employing men who did not belong to the new
union and to prevent them from hiring men who belonged to the United Mine
Workers of America.""

If the picketing itself, that is, the watching or besetting
was not unlawful I cannot see that the fact of the picketers being distributed
in different places and having bonfires on a dark night can make the watching
wrongful.

[Page 513]

In Rex ex rel Barron v. Blachsawl; Rex ex rel
Barron v. Hangsjaa[16], where
the conviction of the appellant on a similar charge was affirmed by this court,
Lyons & Sons v. Wilkins[17], was
strongly relied upon. I understand the court there held that watching and
besetting, however peaceable, was a common law nuisance and, therefore,
wrongful and that the qualifying words in s. 7 as to obtaining and
communicating information alone rendered it rightful. If that decision stood
unchallenged I would not hesitate to say it was conclusive of the present
appeal in favour of the Crown not only by reason of the absence of the
qualifying words in our section 501  but because if they were still in the Act
they do not extend to persuading which was part of the plan here.

The later case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative
Printers' Assistants' Society, February, 1906[18],
applied in Fowler v. Kibble[19], seems
to me to cast considerable doubt on the correctness of the decision in Lyons
v. Wilkins (2). It was not referred to in the Blachsawl Case (1),
and it is said that it was not brought to the attention of the court which I
think is correct. I gather from that case that peaceable picketing was not
considered to be wrongful at common law and was not made illegal by section 7
of the Imperial Act and if that be correct it can scarcely be wrongful under
our s. 501 . But for the fact that owing to the general importance of the
question the defendant is desirous of obtaining the opinion of the Supreme
Court of Canada, I would say that the question is determined by our former
decision but considering it a proper case for an appeal I have decided to
dissent from the judgment of the majority and adopting what I take to be the
result of the Ward, Lock Case (3) would hold that the element of
wrongfulness is lacking in this case and would, therefore, allow the appeal and
quash the conviction.

The foregoing quotation from his judgment shows that all involved
in this appeal, by reason of the dissent of Mr. Justice Clarke, is the doubt he
has as to the meaning of the words ""wrongfully and without lawful
authority"" in the part of section 501  which I have quoted above.

He suggests, as had been suggested long ago by others, that
""besetting and watching"" a house or premises is not in law wrongful,
and hence the basis of the said subsection (f) renders it absolutely
inoperative.

The answer to such an objection is that we must, if possible,
give it some efficacy, and to do that we must ask ourselves if it is correct
that the act of so besetting and watching never was, in law, wrongful.

I answer that such a course of conduct always was at common law
wrongful, and might be the basis of a civil action, and hence clearly wrongful.

[Page 514]

Such was the holding of the court in the case of J. Lyons
& Sons v. Wilkins[20], and
the judgment of Lord Justice Lindley, M.R., at pages 266 and 267, deals with
exactly what has troubled Mr. Justice Clarke herein and, I submit, the passage
therefrom on page 267, which reads as follows:—

But it is not necessary to shew the illegality of the overt
acts complained of by other evidence than that which proves the acts
themselves, if no justification or excuse for them is reasonably consistent
with the facts proved. This is the principle always applied in criminal
prosecutions in which the words ""feloniously,""
""wrongfully,"" or ""maliciously"" are introduced into the
charge, and have to be proved before the person accused can be properly
convicted: see Archbold's Criminal Pleadings and Evidence, 19th ed. pp. 64-7.
That this is the correct method of construing and dealing with the words
""wrongfully and without lawful authority"" in s. 7 is, in my opinion,
perfectly plain if attention is paid to sub-heads 1, 2, 3, and 5, to which those
words are as applicable as they are to sub-head 4. If the overt acts mentioned
in sub-head 1, for example, i.e., using violence or intimidation, are proved,
and it is proved that they were done with a view to compel, etc., and there is
no reasonable ground for justifying them, it is unnecessary to give further
evidence to prove that they were committed ""wrongfully and without legal
authority""; see Reg. v. McKenzie[21].
If this be true of all the subheads except 4 (watching and besetting), I can
discover no justification for giving the words ""wrongfully and without
lawful authority"" any different meaning or effect when applied to
4—namely, ""watching or besetting.""

Others in like manner in same case and in a further appeal refer
to this and express analogous opinions, and such was taken to-be the law until
the case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative Printers'
Assistants' Society et al[22], in
1906, 26th February. Even in that Stirling J. expresses himself as if the court
were in accord with what Lord Justice Lindley had said in the Lyons Case (1).
It was the provision of exception that created the difficulty.

By our Canadian courts, cases were decided in Manitoba and Alberta
adopting the law as settled by Lyons v. Wilkins (1) and
other cases.

This I accept as good law yet, and more especially so when the
subsequent paragraph above referred to had been eliminated in framing our
Criminal Code  in 1892.

It became increasingly more difficult to do so in England by
reason of the Trades Disputes Act, to which I refer above. Indeed that
rendered it almost quite impos-

[Page 515]

sible for us to follow the later English
decisions. I imagine said Act was
a result of the Ward, Lock Case (1).

I need not
elaborate further but submit the foregoing considerations remove all doubts
such as in question, and therefore am of the opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed.

I may add, however,
that having read the entire case I find
there is evidence of actual violence, trespass and abusive and vile language,
even in the presence of policemen keeping guard, which removes all doubt in law
and in fact of the guilt of the appellant, who ran away on hearing someone
approach. Why, if innocent, do so?

I have out of
respect to the learned judge below, dissenting, tried to confine the expression
of my opinion above to the point in which he expresses doubt, but, if others
think we should go beyond, I think
it as well to state concisely my conclusions if needed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Evidence—Accomplice—Corroboration—Warning to jury— Duty of
judge—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Dissenting opinion—Sections 1002 , 1013 (5)  and 1024 
Cr.C .

An entry in the formal judgment of an
appellate court, signed by its president, that two judges dissented from
the judgment for the reasons in law stated in their respective notes, is
sufficient to found jurisdiction for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon
these questions of law under sections 1013 (5)  and 1024  Cr.C . Idington J. dubitante.

When the evidence against a prisoner is the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, it is wrong for the judge to tell the
jury that, if they are quite certain that the accomplice is telling the truth,
they have not only the right to convict the prisoner but that it is their duty
to do so. Rex v. Beebe (41 T.L.R. 635; 19 Cr.
App. Cas. 22) foll. Idington J. dissenting.

Per Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret
JJ.—In such a case, the judge should follow the rule laid down in Baskerville’s
Case (12 Cr. App. Cas. 81):
the judge should warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and, in his discretion, may advise
them not to convict upon such evidence; but he should point out to the jury
that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed
evidence.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the
Court of King’s Bench, criminal side, which had found the appellant guilty of
manslaughter upon the verdict of a jury.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.

Lucien Gendron for
the appellant.

Ernest Bertrand K.C.
for the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and
Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by

[Page 540]

RINFRET J.—The appellant has, by the verdict of
a jury, been found guilty of manslaughter upon an indictment for murder; i.e.
for having, unlawfully and with intent to procure abortion, done on the person
of a girl acts which have caused her death, and which he knew to be likely to
have such result.

Against his conviction he appealed, on grounds
which involved questions of law alone, to the Court of King’s Bench of the
province of Quebec, where his appeal was dismissed and the conviction entered
against him was confirmed in all respects.

The law is that

unless the court of appeal directs to the
contrary in cases where, in the opinion of that court, the question is a
question of law on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should
be pronounced by the members of the court, the judgment of the court shall be
pronounced by the president of the court or such other member of the court
hearing the case as the president of the court directs, and no judgment with respect
to the determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any
other member of the court. (Criminal Code , s. 1013 , subs. 5).

In Davis v. The King[1], it was held that an appeal lies to this
court, under s. 1024  of the Criminal Code  read with s. 1013 , only where a
dissenting opinion has been expressed upon a question which the court of appeal
deems a question of law and pursuant to its direction.

This direction must be evidenced by the order of
the court and should be plainly expressed. The formal judgment here contains
the entry that

Mr. Justice Allard and Mr. Justice Létourneau
entered a dissent from the present judgment for the reasons in law stated in
their respective notes.

This entry, which is signed by the president of
the court, is, in our opinion, consistent only with the view that the court
considered it in the interests of justice that separate judgments should be
pronounced by the dissenting members of the court, and therefore, sufficient to
found jurisdiction for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the questions
of law which are in difference between the learned judges of the court of
appeal.

By force of s. 1024  of the Criminal Code  as
enacted by s. 27  of c 38 of 15 and 16 Geo. V, the right of appeal is limited to

any question of law on which there has been
dissent in the court of appeal.

[Page 541]

In this case, the points of difference were four
in number; but, in the view we take, it will only be necessary to consider the
first of them, as to which both dissenting judges have expressed their
disagreement from the majority of the court. It has reference to a certain
passage of the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury.

The learned judge, after having explained the
law concerning parties to offences (the principals, the accomplices, the actual
perpetrators of the crime and the accessories before or after the fact)
discussed the weight which ought to be given to the evidence of an accomplice
and the necessity for its corroboration. He described what amounts to
corroboration in law; and then he advised the jury as follows:

La Cour d’Appel a
decide que le juge ne doit pas demander aux jurés de
mettre de coté le témoignage d’un complice, mais il doit leur indiquer le
danger qu’il peut y avoir à condamner une personne sur le seul témoignage d’un
complice. Cependant, même si ce témoignage n’est pas appuyé de quelque corroboration, non-seulement vous avez le droit
de le faire, mais c’est votre devoir de le faire, si vous croyez que le
complice qui rend témoignage dit la vérité.

The learned judge was there advising the jury on
a question of law and we must therefor, for the moment, quite independently of
the facts of this case, consider whether in law his direction on that point was
adequate and proper.

An accomplice is a competent witness. Rex v.
Baskerville[2].

There are cases in which the evidence of one
witness must be corroborated (Cr. C.
s. 1002 ). Murder arising out of abortion is not one of them. But, in the King
v. Baskerville2, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England undertook to state “the
law to be applied in future cases” and added:

We trust that it will be unnecessary again
to refer to the earlier decisions of this court.

Lord Reading C.J., when delivering the judgment
said (p. 663):—

It has long been a rule of practice at
common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a
prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and,
in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such
evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their
legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence. Reg. v. Stubbs[3]; In re Meunier[4]. This rule of practice has become virtually
equivalent to a rule of

[Page 542]

law, and since the Court of Criminal
Appeal Act came into operation this court has held that, in the absence of
such a warning by the judge, the conviction must be quashed.

The judgment in the Baskerville
Case[5] as laying down “the law that should be followed by this court” was
expressly adopted by the Court of King’s Bench (appeal side) of the province of
Quebec in The King v. Boycal and Ballan[6].

Since then, the Court of Criminal Appeal has
decided The King v. Beebe[7], which
was a case of abortion. This decision was delivered only on the 6th July 1925
and therefore after the learned trial judge in the present case was called upon
to give his direction to the jury, so that, in justice to him, it should be
said that he lacked the advantage of having before him what may be called an
authoritative interpretation of the Baskerville judgment.

In the Beebe Case7, Lord
Hewart C.J. refers to King v. Baskerville5 and asks: “What does that
judgment say?” His answer is:

A clear distinction is drawn, although it
is drawn in very few words and without elaboration or explanation, between
three things: one, is to tell the jury that it is within their legal province
to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence; the second is, and this is a rule of
universal application in such cases, not a rule to be neglected in some cases
and observed in others, but a rule of universal application, it is a duty to
warn the jury of the danger of convicting a person on the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice or accomplices; the third thing is, that the learned
judge in the exercise of his discretion may advise them not to convict upon
such evidence. One reads that passage side by side with the passages in the
cases referred to, where it appears that so far as Baron Park was concerned he
always advised a jury in such circumstances not to find a person guilty. But
however that may be, there is a distinction drawn between the three different
things the jury are to be told; that it is within their legal province to
convict; they are to be warned in all such cases that it is dangerous to
convict; and they may be advised not to convict.

It is quite clear when one looks at that enumeration of the
various courses, that nowhere is to be found directly or indirectly any
reference to a case in which it may be the duty of the learned judge to advise
the jury in such a case that they ought to convict.

The decision in the Baskerville
Case5 cannot be put in clearer and more powerful language, and it would
be idle to add anything to it.

[Page 543]

Now let us see how far the direction here
complained of compares with the warning in the Beebe Case[8]. Here, the learned
judge said:

Cependant, même si ce témoignage (that of an accomplice)
n’est pas appuyé de quelque corroboration,
non-seulement vous avez le droit de le faire (i.e. to convict), mais c’est votre devoir de
le faire, si vous croyez que le complice qui rend témoignage dit la vérité.

In the Beebe Case8, the
judge presiding the Assizes had said:

If you are quite certain that that girl (an
accomplice) is telling the truth and nothing but the truth so that you are
satisfied in your heart and conscience, although it is uncorroborated, you
ought to act upon it. If you are not satisfied up to the very hilt then do not
do it.

As will be seen, in both passages the language
is almost identical; but, if anything, the direction in the Beebe Case8
was less open to objection. Yet, it elicited the following criticism from the Lord
Chief Justice of England:

Those words are not only not a warning of
the danger of so acting, and not only are they not a refraining from advising
the jury so to act, but they are quite clearly an affirmative and express
direction to the jury that in that event they ought so to act. In the opinion
of this court, that direction is not such a direction as should, according to
the law laid down in Baskerville Case[9], be given.

And the conviction was quashed.

It is true that in the Beebe Case8
there was no corroboration of the evidence of the accomplice. But the direction
of the learned trial judge in this case, at the point complained of, proceeds
on the same assumption (“même si ce témoignage n’est pas appuyé de quelque corroboration”).
It may very well have led the jury to understand that he was in effect advising
them that, under the particular circumstances of this case, it was not
necessary for them to look for corroboration, but if they were satisfied that
the accomplice told the truth, not only was it within their province to convict
the accused on the sole evidence of such accomplice, but it was their duty to
do so. Now, in such a case, while a jury may convict, the rule is not that it
is their duty to convict.

In our opinion, this is conclusive of the
appeal. When once a case of misdirection is made out, the burden is upon the
Crown to show that, as a result, there has been no miscarriage of justice, (s.
1014 Cr. C). Here, the Crown has

[Page 544]

failed to convince us that, but for the
direction above referred to, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.

No doubt it is the settled rule in England that
the appeal may be dismissed, although the point raised should be decided in
favour of the appellant, if the court considers that no substantial wrong has
occurred. The rule is embodied in s. 1014 subs. 2 of our Criminal Code ; and
only a short time ago this court made an application of it in Baker v. The
King[10].

But, as was said by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J.
in Allen v. The King[11]:

I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I
said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be
trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are
so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by
it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that
doubt propter favorem vitae.

In the Allen’s Case11, all
the judges below had found that there was ample evidence that the prisoner
killed Captain Elliston and, as would appear from the report, all the judges of
this court concurred in that opinion. Nevertheless, because some evidence had
been improperly admitted or something not according to law had been done which
might have operated prejudicially to the accused upon a material issue,
although it had not been and could not be shown that it did, in fact, so
operate, and although the evidence properly admitted warranted the conviction,
a new trial was ordered.

In the circumstances of this case we cannot come
to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been influenced by the
improper direction and therefore the conviction cannot stand.

Since the case must go before another jury, we
purposely refrain from discussing the evidence tendered in corroboration of the
testimony of the accomplice; and we should not in the slightest be understood
to mean that there is not in the record ample corroboration to justify a
conviction under proper direction. We think however, the jury may have been led
to disregard this issue and to think that they might well reach their verdict
without considering whether or not

[Page 545]

such corroboration was sufficient to warrant a
conviction. Were this court now to decide that it was, it would transfer to
itself the determination of a question which the accused has the right to have
tried by a jury, Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[12].

We are therefore of opinion that the appeal must
be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Idington J. (dissenting).—Before receiving a copy of my brother Rinfret’s
opinion herein, I had read the entire appeal book in this case, as well as the
factums, and considered same, and had arrived at the conclusion that this
appeal should be dismissed. I may say that the Beebe Case[13], where there was no corroborating
evidence, yet so much relied upon by counsel for appellant, does not seem to me
to have much resemblance to this case.

Indeed the expression of the learned trial judge
herein complained of, seemed to me as if he had simply, in a very long charge,
made a slip in failing to add a word or two such as under the circumstances set
forth in other evidence adduced in the case; and not likely to have influenced
the jury unduly.

And I may say as to the decision in the Court of
Criminal Appeal in England, constituted under the Act of 1907, we have not the
same powers as that, and hence must be on our guard, in that respect, in the
disposition we make of cases presented to us within our restricted jurisdiction
over criminal cases.

As there is to be a new trial I must content
myself with saying that for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Green-shields,
concurred in by Mr. Justice Dorion, with which in the main I agree, I am of the
opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Homicide—Admission
of dying declaration—Admissibility upheld by court of appeal—Motion for leave
to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada under S. 1024A Cr. Code—Alleged conflict with
decision in Allen v. The King, 44 Can. S.C.R., 331.

A person suffering from a
wound from which she later died made a signed declaration that the wound was
inflicted by a knife in the hand of the accused. At that time she had not that
settled hopeless expectation of death requisite to the admissibility of a dying
declaration. Shortly before her death her said statement was read to her (she
being first told that the statement about to be read was the one she had made
previously) and she assented to its correctness and signed it by her mark. This
latter declaration and evidence thereof was admitted at the accused's trial,
and its admissibility was upheld unanimously by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Application was made on behalf of accused for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1024A of the Criminal Code , on the ground that
the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicted with the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Canada in Allen v. The King, 44 Can. S.C.R.,
331.

Held, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal did not
conflict with the judgment in the Allen Case, and the application was
dismissed.

MOTION for leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1024A of the Criminal Code , from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia upholding the admissibility in
evidence at the trial of the accused of a certain dying declaration. The
material facts of the case are stated in the judgment now reported.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the motion.

D. Donaghy contra.

NEWCOMBE J.—In this case a dying
declaration of the murdered woman was admitted at the trial. The accused was
tried at Vancouver and found guilty. He appealed from his conviction to
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia upon two grounds, which are stated in
the notice of appeal as follows:—

(a) the said
conviction cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

[Page 493]

(b) the learned judge
of Assize wrongfully admitted an alleged dying declaration or ante-mortem
statement of one Pearl Prosser (also known as Pearl Travesey), and evidence
thereof.

The appeal was dismissed
unanimously by the learned justices of appeal who heard the case. Application
is now made on behalf of the prisoner for leave to appeal to this court under
s. 1024A of the Criminal Code , on the ground that the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, dismissing the prisoner's appeal to that court, conflicts with the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Allen v. The King[1].

It appears that the woman was
taken to the hospital in a taxi-cab on 27th November, 1925, suffering from a
severe wound from which she died on 16th January, 1926. On 8th January she had made a declaration, which was taken down, and
which she signed, and in which she declared that the wound was inflicted by a
knife in the hand of the prisoner. But at that time she had not that settled
hopeless expectation of death which is requisite to the admissibility of a
dying declaration. Her condition became worse, and when, on 15th January, she
was asked to make the statement which was used at the trial, and about the
admissibility of which the question arises, what occurred is stated by Roderick
McLeod, a detective of the Vancouver police force, who gave the following
evidence before the jury:—

The doctor reported to me
her condition. I then turned to Earl Robinson (the magistrate who had taken
down her statement on the 8th) who was at the table and addressed the woman. I
said this was the man who had taken a statement from her on a previous occasion
and I said: ""This gentleman is going to read to you Pearl the statement
that we got from you before, and I am going to ask you if it is correct. You
will tell me if it is or not."" So Earl Robinson proceeded to read the
statement that he had in his book * * * The statement he read was the statement
that she gave to us the week previously.

Then follows Mr. McLeod's account
of the reading of the previous statement, question and answer, and of the
woman's assent. When the writing was finished she tried to sign, but was too
weak, and she made her mark.

It is urged that according to the
principle of the decision of this court in Allen v. The King[2],
the statement so obtained, which was admitted and read at the trial, and
subsequently held admissible by the Court of Appeal, was inadmissible because
of the evidence which identifies the woman's narrative of what took place when
the fatal blow 

[Page 494]

was struck with her account as
given a week previously, when she still entertained hope of recovery.

In Allen v. The King[3]
a witness had testified at the preliminary investigation who was not produced
at the trial, and the requirements for the admission of his deposition under s.
999  of the Criminal Code  were not established. When the prisoner came to give
his evidence however he was cross-examined with regard to some of the
statements which this witness had made and which were taken down at the
preliminary inquiry, and it was held by a majority of this court that the
result of this was that a material portion of the deposition taken before the
police magistrate had been given to the jury without the conditions of the Act
being complied with, and that the evidence was therefore inadmissible.

The Court of Appeal of British Columbia has determined that the declaration now in question was admissible, and
of course it is not for me to review that decision. The question I think is
whether that court should have held otherwise upon the proper interpretation
and application of the decision in Allen v. The King[4].

The evidence produced before the
jury shews that the declaration in proof was elicited by a communication to the
deceased that the statement about to be read to her was that which she had
signed on 8th January, followed by the reading to her of that statement, and
that her declaration of 15th January was identical in its description of the
facts of the tragedy with the one made by her on the previous occasion, when
she did not realize that she was going to die. It may be that these facts
affect only the weight or credibility, not the admissibility, of the
declaration, that is not for me to decide, but if that were the view of the
Court of Appeal, I find nothing to conflict with it in the judgment of this
court in the Allen Case[5].
Indeed, after the most careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion
that ingenuity cannot suggest anything involved in the judgment in Allen's
Case[6]
with which the judgment of the Court of Appeal upholding the admission of the
declaration of 15th January is necessarily in conflict. 

I must therefore dismiss the
application.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Appeal—Deafness
of juror as ground for—Question of law or fact or "" sufficient ground
"" within discretion of court—""Substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice""—Grand jury—Error in written order summoning persons—Oral order by
judge valid—Presiding judge –Sections 1013  and 1014  Criminal Code —Jury Act,
B.C. 1913, c. 34, s. 31.

An appeal on the ground that a juror was deaf and the jury,
therefore, illegally constituted is not an appeal on a question of law within
clause (a) of section 1013  Cr. C., neither is the question one of fact
alone or of mixed law and fact within clause (b), but it falls within
clause (c) of that section; and therefore leave of the Court of Appeal
was a condition precedent to the respondent's right of appeal to that court.

Although on the case being referred back to the Court of
Appeal the respondent may obtain leave, his appeal on the ground of the
disqualification of the petit juror would ultimately fail, because in the
circumstances of this case, even though that disqualification should be
established, it did not cause a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (e)
Cr. C.) or should be dismissed because "" no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has actually occurred "" (s. 1014 (2).

An order made by the judge designated to preside at the
assizes directing the sheriff to summon other persons to serve on the grand and
petit juries in the places of those whom the sheriff had been unable to serve
was drawn up, by inadvertence, to cover only the summoning of petit jurymen.

Held that the order as pronounced by the judge may be
regarded as the order made by him rather than the order in the mistaken form in
which it was drawn up, and there had been no illegality in the constitution of
the grand jury.

[Page 526]

The judge designated to hold the assizes may in advance of the
actual opening of the court, for the purposes of section 31 of the Jury Act
(B.C. 1913, c. 34) be regarded as the ""presiding judge.""

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1925] 2 W.W.R. 40) reversed.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent for
manslaughter and directing a new trial.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. and M.
B. Jackson K.C. for the appellant.

No counsel appeared for the
respondent at the argument.

The judgment of the court was
delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The Attorney-General
appeals by leave of a judge of this court, under s. 1024  (a) of the
Criminal Code , against an order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
setting aside the conviction of the defendant and directing a new trial.
Although he appeared by counsel on the application for leave to appeal and was
duly served with notice of the appeal, the defendant was not represented on the
argument and the appeal was heard ex parte.

Convicted of manslaughter on his
trial before Mr. Justice Murphy and a jury, the defendant appealed to the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia. Three grounds of appeal were urged:—

 (a) misdirection

 (b) illegality in the constitution of the
grand jury; and

 (c) disqualification of a
petit juror through deafness.

The judgment of the Court of
Appeal, pronounced by the Chief Justice, was that the conviction be set aside
and a new trial ordered on the ground that one of the petit jurors was
disqualified by deafness; that the question involved in this ground of appeal
was a question of law alone in respect of which leave to appeal was
unnecessary; that such leave was accordingly refused; and that the members of
the court might pronounce separate judgments. (S. 1013  of the Criminal Code , as
enacted by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9.)

[Page 527]

Judgments were accordingly
delivered by each of the judges who composed the court.

 (a) There was no expression of opinion by any
of them on the alleged misdirection.

On ground (b) two of the
learned judges (Martin and M. A. Macdonald, JJ.A.) were of the opinion that the
appeal should be allowed and the indictment quashed. McPhillips J.A. expressed
no opinion on this point. Galliher J.A. was of the view that this ground of
appeal was met by s. 1011  of the Criminal Code ; and the learned Chief Justice
thought that it should, if known, have been raised at the trial by motion to
quash the indictment and that in any case it involved a question of fact and
law as to which an appeal would not lie without leave, which, presumably, he
would have refused.

(c) Martin, Galliher and
McPhillips, JJ.A., were of opinion that the objection to the disqualification
of the petit juror raised a question of law alone within clause (a) of
s. 1013  in respect of which there was a right of appeal without leave; that
evidence taken by direction of the Court of Appeal under s. 1021 established
deafness amounting to disqualification of the juror Keown; that, as a result,
there had been a miscarriage of justice; and that the conviction should be set
aside. The Chief Justice, dissenting, held that the question raised by this
ground of appeal was one of mixed law and fact falling within clause (b)
of s. 1013 ; that, in the absence of a certificate of the trial court that it
was a fit case for appeal, no appeal lay without leave of the Court of Appeal;
and that, under the circumstances, which he detailed, leave should be refused,
Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald expressed no opinion on this ground of appeal.

The Court of Appeal is a
statutory court (Criminal Code , s. 2 , s.s. 7; s. 1012  (b). The right of
appeal to it is conferred and defined by s. 1013  of the Criminal Code  (13-14
Geo. V, c. 41, s. 9). Subsections 1 and 3 of that section read as follows:—

1013. (1) A person convicted
on indictment may appeal to the court of appeal against his conviction;

(a) on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone ; and 

(b) with leave of the
court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that it is a fit
case for appeal, on any ground of appeal 

[Page 528]

which involves a question of
fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the
court of appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be
a sufficient ground of appeal.

(3) No proceeding in error
shall be taken in any criminal case, and the powers and practice now existing
in the court of criminal appeal for any province, in respect of motions for or
the granting of new trials of persons convicted on indictment, are hereby
abolished.

The Criminal Code  does not
contain a provision corresponding to s.s. 4 of s. 20 of the English Criminal
Appeal Act. (7 Edw. VII, c. 23.)

The defendant asserted a right of
appeal under clause (a) of s.s. 1 of s. 1013  and, alternatively, asked
leave to appeal if his case should be deemed to fall not within that clause but
within clause (b) or clause (c) of that subsection. There was no
suggestion that any other remedy was open to him.

By s. 921 (1) of the Criminal
Code 

Every person qualified and
summoned as a grand or petit juror, according to the laws in force for the time
being in any province of Canada, shall be duly qualified to serve as such juror
in criminal cases in that province.

By s. 5 (1) of the Jury Act (B.C.
1913, c. 34) a person afflicted with deafness incompatible with the discharge
of the duties of a juror is absolutely disqualified for service as a juror.
Such disqualification is not a ground of challenge for cause. (S. 935  of the
Criminal Code .)

We are of the opinion that the
ground of appeal resting on the alleged disqualification of the petit juror
does not fall within clause (a) of s. 1013 . That clause was meant to
cover questions of law arising out of the proceedings at the trial based upon
facts admitted or conclusively found and not involving the appreciation or
weighing of evidence by the appellate court. This is implied in the terms
"" law alone."" The facts on which such questions were submitted under
the former practice were found and stated by the trial judge: no matter of fact
was open for decision by the appellate court. Here the deafness of a juror
incompatible with the discharge of his duties was in issue; its existence was
contested by the Crown; such determination of it as there was at the trial, if
any, was adverse to the defendant; and in any case this ground of appeal
involved the determination of a question of fact by the Court of Appeal upon
evidence not before the trial court but taken by direction of the Court of
Appeal under 

[Page 529]

the powers conferred upon it by
s. 1021. This ground of appeal clearly did not "" involve a question of law
alone."" 

Neither, in our opinion, is the
question one of fact alone, or of mixed law and fact within clause (b)
of s. 1013 . We incline to the view that the questions contemplated by that
clause relate to matters which are in issue on the trial and the determination
of which by the trial court is challenged.

In our view the ground of appeal
now under consideration falls rather within clause (c) of s. 1013 —

any other ground of appeal
which appears to the Court of Appeal to be a sufficient ground of appeal.

(Archbold, Cr. Pl., Ev.,
Pr., 26th Ed., 338). The question is as to the constitution of the petit jury.
Where such a defect in the constitution of the petit jury is charged as might
involve a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (c) ) the Court of Appeal
may regard it as something which, if established, would be a sufficient ground
of appeal. But an appeal lies under clause (c) of s. 1013  only ""
with leave of the Court of Appeal.""

We are, therefore, of the view
that leave of the Court of Appeal was a condition precedent to the defendant's
right of appeal. Inasmuch as the Court of Appeal proceeded on the view that
such leave was unnecessary it did not exercise the discretion conferred on it
by the statute in respect to the giving or refusing of leave. It follows that
its order setting aside the defendant's conviction and directing a new trial
cannot be maintained on the ground on which it was based.

Under such circumstances the
usual course would be to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in order that it
should pass upon the defendant's application for leave to appeal. But we should
not send the case back for that purpose if satisfied that, although the
defendant should obtain leave, his appeal on the ground of the disqualification
of the petit juror must fail, because, even though that disqualification should
be established, it did not cause a miscarriage of justice (s. 1014 (1) (c)
), or should be dismissed because ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred"" (s. 1014 (2) ). The pertinent facts are
stated by Macdonald C.J.A. as follows:—

During the trial a rumour
was started which came to the ears of the trial judge to the effect that one of
the jurors was afflicted with deaf-

[Page 530]

ness. Counsel for the
appellant urged that the trial should be proceeded with. He even went the
length of offering an undertaking that no question would be raised concerning
the juror in question in case of an appeal. This was practically a confession
that there was no ground for the rumour; but be that as it may, the accused,
through his counsel, had the opportunity of having the rumour confirmed or
denied, and if confirmed of asking that the jury should be dismissed and a new
jury called, but far from taking that course he gave as one of his reasons for
urging that the trial be proceeded with, that some of his witnesses were from a
distance and might not be available again. The undertaking was not accepted by
the learned judge, but that does not affect the fact that the objection which
counsel might then have taken against the proceeding at the trial was not
taken. The appellant took his chance of success with the jury as it was then
constituted, and with knowledge that there was a question respecting the
hearing of one of the jurors, and it was only when he failed to secure an acquittal
that this rumour was revived. *** We were satisfied, on consultation with the
learned trial judge, that the test made by him of having the sheriff call over,
once in an ordinary tone of voice, and once in a lower tone, was not known to
either the appellant or his counsel but there is no suggestion that the
appellant was not made aware of the alleged deafness of the juror.

It is thus apparent that the
question of the deafness of the juror Keown was canvassed during the trial and
that, with the knowledge that the learned trial judge was aware that that
question had been raised and must have satisfied himself that Keown's deafness
was not so great as to be incompatible with his discharge of the duties of a
juror before allowing the trial to proceed with him as a member of the petit
jury, counsel representing the defendant, to suit his own purposes, acquiesced
in that course being taken.

Under these circumstances we are
not disposed to admit the right of the defendant to contend on appeal that the
presence of Keown on the petit jury resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and,
if he should be allowed to do so, we are fully convinced that

no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(Cr. C. s. 1014 (2) ).

We, therefore, think that so far
as the defendant's appeal to the Court of Appeal rests on this ground it should
now be dismissed.

The objection to the constitution
of the grand jury rests on the facts that an order of Mr. Justice Murphy,
purporting to be made by him as presiding judge at the assizes, and directing
the sheriff to summon other persons to serve on the grand and petit juries in
the places of those whom the sheriff had been unable to serve (Jury Act, B.C.
1913, 

[Page 531]

c. 34, s. 31) was in fact made by
him six days before the assizes opened and by inadvertence was drawn up to
cover only the summoning of additional petit jurymen, although the record shews
that it was sought in respect of the grand jury as well as of the petit jury.
There is no doubt that the learned judge meant his order to cover both grand
and petit jurors and there is equally no doubt that the omission of the words
"" the grand jury and "" in the operative clause was a mere clerical
error entirely due to a slip, or inadvertence, on the part of the solicitor who
drew the order up.

Under these circumstances we
incline to think the order as pronounced by the learned judge may be regarded
as the order made by him rather than the order in the mistaken form in which it
was drawn up. Hatton v. Harris[2]
; Milson v. Carter[3].
In any case, however, if the consequences of the mistake made in drawing up the
order should afford a ground on which "" the appeal, might be decided in
favour of the appellant,"" we are convinced that "" no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred "" as a result of
such mistake.

Although the statute authorizes
"" the presiding judge "" to make the order and, on a strict
construction, this might be held to confer jurisdiction only after the sittings
of the Assize Court had begun, convenience obviously requires that the
jury panels shall be filled in advance of the actual sitting of the court.
Giving to s. 31 (of the Jury Act) a construction designed to advance the remedy
it was meant to afford, we are of opinion that the judge designated to hold the
assizes may in advance of the actual opening of the court for the purposes of
the section be regarded as "" the presiding judge"" to whom the sheriff
is to report and who may, on request made on behalf of the Crown, make the
order.

Moreover, we incline to agree
with Mr. Justice Galliher that s. 1011  of the Criminal Code , notwithstanding
the absence from it of the word "" summoning,"" was meant to preclude
the impeaching of a verdict on the grounds such as these. The defendant's appeal
to the Court of Appeal on this ground should, therefore, likewise stand
dismissed.

[Page 532]

There remains the ground of
misdirection. This was not discussed at bar and so far as appears from the
material before us was not passed upon in the Court of Appeal. Moreover the
charge of the learned judge is not in the record. Having regard to the further
fact that the defendant was not represented on the argument of the appeal, we
think the only course open to us is to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in
order that that court may pass upon the grounds of appeal based on
misdirection.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA.

Criminal law—Seduction under promise of marriage—Previous
illicit connection—Previous chastity of complainant—Findings of the jury—Arts.
210, 212, 1002, 1140 Cr. C.

[Page 88]

The appellant was convicted for having, under promise of
marriage, seduced and had illicit connection with an unmarried female of
previously chaste character under the age of 21 years. The girl complainant, at
the trial, admitted that she had had illicit connection with the appellant on one
previous occasion under mutual promise of marriage.

Held, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the fact of
the previous seduction did not preclude the jury from finding the complainant
to be ""of previously chaste character"" within the meaning of article
212 Cr. C., the question whether or not the facts and surrounding circumstances
could justify such a conclusion being one to be determined by the jury alone.

Judgment of the Appellate Division (15 Alta. L.R. 313; [1920]
2 W.W.R. 251) affirmed, Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta[1],
dismissing, on equal division of the court, the appeal by the appellant from
the refusal of Simmons J., at the trial with a jury, to reserve a case for the
opinion of the Appellate Division.

[Page 89]

The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are
fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

W. F. O'Connor K.C. for the appellant.

W. L. Scott for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This was an appeal from the judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which, on an equal
division of opinion, refused to quash a conviction against the appellant
prisoner under section 212  of the Criminal Code  for having, under promise of
marriage, seduced and had illicit connection on or about the 27th day of March,
1919, with one Mary Kovack, an unmarried female under the age of 21 years.

Two questions only were raised and argued at bar: one, whether
the evidence of Mary Kovack, the female in question, was corroborated or not;
and the other, whether she was at the time of the alleged offence of previously
chaste character.

After hearing Mr. O'Connor, counsel for the appellant, on the
question of corroboration, we were unanimously of the opinion that there was
sufficient evidence of corroboration, and Mr. Scott was not called on to reply
on that point.

The second question raised a much more delicate and difficult
point: Was the jury justified in not finding the complainant Mary Kovack, at
the time of the illicit connection of the 27th March between her and the
prisoner, a girl of previously unchaste character?

The material facts necessary to reach a conclusion on that point
are fully set in the learned judge's reasons given in the Appellate Division[2].
The

[Page 90]

parties were, at the time of the
commission of the offence on the 27th March, and for some length of time before
that, engaged to be married to each other. They were both of them foreigners
whose parents had emigrated to Canada. At a date about the latter end of
December previously or the beginning of January, and at a time when the
marriage engagement existed, there had been on one occasion illicit connection
between the prisoner and Mary Kovack, but at the time this prosecution
commenced, more than twelve months having elapsed, that offence was barred by
the statutory limitation of time.

The prosecution, therefore, was necessarily confined to the
second offence of the 27th March, 1919, a date when the engagement for marriage
still continued, and the question immediately arose whether on the admission by
the complainant of the first offence having taken place in the latter end of
December or the beginning of January previously she could be found by the jury
to have been of ""previously chaste character"" on the 27th March when
the second offence was committed.

Some evidence was given in prisoner's behalf by some young men to
the effect that the girl complainant was not chaste, but the jury disbelieved
that evidence, and the sole question, therefore, remains whether the single
lapse of virtue by her with the prisoner on or about the last of December when
the parties were under a mutual promise of marriage prevented the jury finding
her to be of ""chaste character"" when the offence of March 27th was
committed.

I am not able to accept the argument that such a single fall from
grace of a woman, engaged to a man to whose solicitations she yields, either
because of a weaker will than his or that combined with affection

[Page 91]

and a hope of their prospective marriage
under his promise, necessarily stamps that woman as one of an unchaste
character for all future time. That surely cannot be so. There must come a time
when repentance and pureness of living can rehabilitate her as a chaste
character within the meaning of the statute.

Whether or not the facts and surrounding circumstances justify
such a conclusion can only be determined by a jury.

In this case, the jury had the advantage of seeing the
complainant in the witness box and hearing from her all the material facts
necessary to enable them to reach a conclusion as to her family relationship,
nationality, occupation, conditions and habits of life, marriage engagement
with the promise and other material facts, and to determine from her manner,
demeanour and evidence when examined and cross-examined, whether she should be
believed in whole or in part.

The prisoner acting upon his rights remained mute.

The result was that they found her not to be of an unchaste
character when the offence of 27th March was committed, and, unless I am
compelled to find that one previous fall from virtue with the same man to whom
on both occasions she was engaged to be married prohibits a jury from finding
the same woman afterwards to be of a chaste character within the meaning of the
Code, then I must accept the jury's finding. There is no arbitrary lapse of
time which I can suggest as necessary before a jury can so find. It must be a
case for determination on the facts and circumstances of each case. But
assuming the jury to have been properly charged and directed upon the question,
I think it would require a very extreme case to justify a court of appeal in
setting aside their finding.

[Page 92]

In substance, then I conclude that if under such circumstances as
we have in this case before us, a woman falls to the solicitations of a man to
whom she is engaged to be married, she does not, from that single fact,
necessarily become such an unchaste character within the meaning of those words
in the section of the Code before us as prevents a jury finding her, three
months afterwards, not to be unchaste in character. It must be in the very
nature of things a fact for the jury, under all the proved facts and being
properly directed, to find.

There is no statutory limit of time which must elapse in order
that she may rehabilitate herself. There is no arbitrary time which the court
may set up which must so elapse. I cannot set up my judgment, not having seen
or heard the witnesses but simply from reading the record, against the findings
under proper direction of the jury who did see and hear them.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

IDINGTON J.—The questions raised by the dissenting
judgment so far as relevant to the requirement by the statute of corroboration
""in some material particular"" were practically disposed of on the
argument.

For my part I am of the opinion that in such a case the previous
relations of the parties concerned may well form the subject of inquiry and
evidence adduced on such a basis become of the most cogent character for the
purposes of corroboration.

When that is applied herein there seems to be no reason for
doubting the evidence of the girl.

But its very application and the mode of thought by which it
becomes effective, tend to raise much doubt and difficulty in regard to the
other question of the girl having at the time in question been of previously
""chaste character.""

[Page 93]

The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stuart with which Mr.
Justice Ives concurred, is the basis of any jurisdiction we may have to hear
this appeal, and on this latter ground I have some difficulty in finding a
clear and decided dissent.

The burden of his argument deals with the question of want of
corroboration and all incidental thereto. He holds the evidence of what took
place in December was inadmissable when presented, as it was, by the Crown.

The burden of proof relative to the want of previous chastity by
the complainant is expressly cast, by section 210 of the Code, upon the
accused.

If it was, however, admitted in evidence, then I think he had a
right to rely upon it, for what it was worth, as fully as if adduced
specifically on his own behalf.

Yet Mr. Justice Stuart contents himself with relying upon the
non-admissibility of it relative to the question of corroboration.

The question of her previous chastity is presented by objections
Nos. 3 and 4 of appellant's counsel at the trial, as follows:

3. His Lordship should have withdrawn the case from the jury
on the ground that there was evidence of previous unchastity.

4. Assuming in the complainant's favour all the facts that
the jury could upon evidence reasonably find in her favour, that is, assuming
that the accused in undertaking the burden of proving the unchastity which
section 210 casts upon him proved against the complainant the least that the
jury could upon the evidence reasonably find against her, were those facts such
as to constitute the complainant a girl of previously unchaste character?

Mr. Justice Stuart in his final disposition of this part of the
appeal disposes of it as follows :—

As to question 3, my view is that, under the existing
authorities and precedents especially in the American States whence the law has
come, the case should have been withdrawn from the jury and I would answer it
in the affirmative. But in view of my much firmer opinion on questions 2 and 5
I do not think it necessary to discuss the matter more fully. This also makes
an answer to question 4 unnecessary.

[Page 94]

These points though submitted as separate really in substance
deal with one and the same issue in law. The learned judge appears to answer
one hesitatingly and declines to answer the other.

Is that such a dissent as to entitle us to speak? I have grave
doubts as to its being so. We should have a clear and explicit dissent to rest
our jurisdiction upon.

The majority of the court think it is, and answer accordingly.

As I understand the proposed answer it is to be that the question
was one for the jury.

And, as the learned trial judge left it to the jury in a way that
cannot be complained of, unless that he should have withdrawn the case from the
jury entirely, and the majority of this court hold he could not do so, I may
say that I much doubt if that is a satisfactory view of the law applicable to the
very peculiar facts in question herein.

Many decisions have been given that tend to uphold such a ruling,
but I doubt if any of them have gone quite so far as to justify the so holding
in this peculiar case.

I do not hold any such decided opinion as to warrant my dissent.

I see no good purpose to be served by enlarging upon the matter.

Indeed to meet the possibility of such a case as of this class
again arising, enabling the offender to set up his own wrong as a means of
defence, I submit the law might well be so amended as to prevent the
possibility of such a curious means of defence.

DUFF J (dissenting).—This appeal should, in my
opinion, be allowed on the short ground that evidence of previous conduct could
only be admissible as tending to shew a reciprocal state of feeling between the
two

[Page 95]

persons concerned making it not only
probable that the prisoner would desire to have intercourse with the
prosecutrix but a disposition on her part also to yield to him. It could not be
admitted for the purpose of shewing merely that the accused was a person who
was likely to try to commit the offence with which he was charged; and it could
only be admitted as evidence of a reciprocal guilty inclination existing at the
time the offence was alleged to have been committed. The result must be either
that the prosecution alleging the woman was chaste on the occasion of the
occurrence out of which the complaint arises could not be allowed to say that
the evidence was admissible or that the evidence having been admitted upon
assumptions inconsistent with ""chastity"" on any reasonable
interpretation of the words used in the statute, a verdict against the accused
involving a finding of chastity could not legally be based upon such evidence.
To hold otherwise would be playing fast and loose with justice.

ANGLIN J.—It was intimated on the argument that the court
was of opinion that there was sufficient corroboration of the complainant's
story to satisfy the statute (sec. 1002  of the Criminal Code ). The King v.
Shellaker[3],
is direct authority for the admissibility of some of this corroborative
testimony and The King v. Ball[4],
indicates its value and effect.

On the other question I am of opinion that from the facts deposed
to by the complainant—that she had received many visits from the appellant and
that they had spent many hours together between Christmas, 1916, and the 27th
of March, 1917, when the act of illicit connection on which the present case
rests occurred, and that there had been no illicit

[Page 96]

intercourse between them in that
interval—if believed by them, the jury might not unreasonably draw the
inference that the complainant, although seduced by the appellant under promise
of marriage about Christmas, 1916, had so far recovered herself on the 27th of
March, 1917, as to have become at that time once more a woman ""of
previously chaste character"" within the meaning of sec. 212  of the
Criminal Code . If, as is practically conceded, that section does not require
that the woman should be virgo intacta—if, as I think, the doctrine of
rehabilitation is admissible under it, I am unable to accede to the contention
that the trial judge should, or could properly, have withdrawn this case from
the jury. It was for them to determine what credit should be given to the complainant's
evidence, and what inference should be drawn as to the chastity of her
character—for that was the issue—on the 27th of March, three months after the
one previous act of unchastity which she admitted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

BRODEUR J. (dissenting).—There was a question
raised in this appeal as to whether the evidence of the complainant had been
corroborated. It is not necessary on a charge of criminal seduction under
promise of marriage that the corroboration should be as to every fact, it is sufficient
if it confirms the belief that the prosecutrix is speaking the truth. Art. 1002 
Criminal Code ; The King v. Daun[5].

There are facts disclosed by other witnesses than the complainant
which show conclusively that there was criminal intercourse between the
complainant

[Page 97]

and the accused and that this intercourse
took place at the time the promise of marriage was made. I have no doubt that
there was sufficient corroboration.

But the main question is whether the complainant was of a
""previously chaste character,"" as required by section 212  of the
Criminal Code .

The girl was seduced for the first time, according to her own
story, by the appellant on Christmas Day, 1918. But she failed to lay any
charge for this offence during the year which followed its commission and there
was limitation of time for commencing a prosecution on this offence of
Christmas 1918 (Sec 1140 s.s. e-5). Then she made a charge against the
appellant that she was seduced a second time by him in March, 1919. During her
evidence at the trial she had to admit that she had surrendered her chastity
three months before March, 1919.

Her own statement and admission as to having lost her chastity a
few months before the relations of March, 1919, made it imperative on the trial
judge to withdraw the case from the jury, because one of the essential
ingredients of the crime which is charged did not exist, according to the
statement of the complainant herself. She was no more a chaste woman in March,
1919. Of course, the burden of proof of previous unchastity was upon the
accused (art. 210 C.C.); but the evidence of the girl herself rendered it
unnecessary for the accused to bring any witnesses to prove her unchastity.

It is contended, however, that a woman who has been guilty of
unchaste conduct may subsequently become chaste in legal contemplation and be
seduced a second time. But no evidence was brought to

[Page 98]

show that this girl regained her chastity
in the few months which elapsed between December, 1918, and March, 1919. The
jury could not, with the evidence they had before them, declare that this girl
was, in March, 1919, of a ""previously chaste character."" Their
verdict should be set aside and the prisoner should have been acquitted.

The appeal should be allowed with costs.

MIGNAULT J.—The only question on which this court found it
advisable to hear counsel for the respondent was whether there was evidence on
which the jury could find that the complainant; notwithstanding the fact of her
seduction by the appellant under promise of marriage about the beginning of
January, 1919, was an unmarried female ""of previously chaste
character"" when she was seduced by the appellant on the 27th March of the
same year. The evidence was that although the complainant met the appellant
very frequently from January to the 27th March, she did not, after the first
seduction, have any illicit connection with him until the latter date. From
this evidence the jury could infer that notwithstanding her fall in January,
she had rehabilitated herself and was on the 27th March an unmarried female
""of previously chaste character."" It is not for us to say that we
would have so considered her, but the question is whether the previous
seduction of the complainant precluded the jury on the evidence from finding
that she had rehabilitated herself, or, in the words of the statute, that she
was then an

unmarried female of previously
chaste character under twenty-one years of age.

[Page 99]

This was eminently a fact for the jury's determination, and I cannot say that there was no evidence
to go to the jury on which they could find this fact.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Perjury—Ground
of appeal—No evidence as to accused having been a witness—Motion for leave to
appeal to Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1024a Cr. Code—Alleged conflict with
decision in Rex v. Drummond (1905) 10 Ont. L.R. 546—Production at the
trial of the judgment in the civil action.

The appellant having been
found guilty of perjury committed in the trial of a civil action, one of the
grounds of appeal to the appellate court was that there had been no evidence
that the appellant was a witness in a judicial proceeding. The conviction
having been affirmed, the appellant moved for leave to appeal to this court
under s. 1024a Cr. Code, on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed
from conflicts with a judgment of an Ontario appellate court in a like case: Rex v. Drummond
10 Ont. L.R. 546.

[Page 81]

Held that the decision in the Drummond Case did
not conflict with the judgment in this case: in the former case there was no
record whatever produced, while in the present case the copy of the pleadings
made use of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. The application
for leave to appeal was dismissed.

Semble that, although production, at the trial, of the
judgment disposing of the civil action was not necessary, it would have been
better practice that it should be put in in order to complete the record.

MOTION for leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1024a of the Criminal Code , from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1] upholding the conviction of the appellant for
perjury in the trial of a civil action. The material facts of the case are
stated in the judgments now reported.

Smellie K.C. for the motion.

Ritchie K.C. contra.

December 14, 1926.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—Motion for leave to
appeal under s. 1024  (a) of the Criminal Code  on the ground that the
judgment sought to be appealed from conflicts with a judgment of the Ontario
Appellate Division in a like case. In the case at bar one of the grounds of
appeal to the Appellate Division was that

there is no evidence that
Gurditta was a witness in a judicial proceeding when he made the assertion
which is charged as a perjury.

The alleged perjury was committed
in the trial of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta. At the
trial of the perjury charge the clerk of assize proved from the entries in his
court record that Gurditta had been sworn as a witness and had given evidence
on the trial of the civil action. The court stenographer proved the evidence
given by Gurditta at that trial. Counsel for the Crown put in evidence, as
exhibit I, the record prepared for the use of the judge at the trial pursuant
to rule 454, consisting of a certified copy of the endorsement upon the writ of
summons and of the statement of defence, being the whole of the pleadings. The
clerk of assize gave evidence that the case of Brama v. Gurditta,
in which this record was used, was tried at the assize held before Mr. Justice
Morrison on the 22nd of February, 1926, on which date the indictment charges
the

[Page 82]

perjury was committed. The
judgment disposing of the civil action does not appear to have been put in
evidence.

In the judgment of the Appellate
Division in the present proceeding Mr. Justice Martin, delivering the opinion
of the court, held, on the authority of Regina v. Scott[2]
, that it had been sufficiently established that Gurditta had given the
evidence on which the perjury charge rests in a judicial proceeding, i.e., upon
the trial before Mr. Justice Morrison of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta
of which the record was put in evidence.

This conclusion is said to
conflict with the decision of the Ontario Appellate Division in Rex v. Drummond[3]
, followed in Rex v. Legros[4] ;
Rex v. Farrell [5]. As is
pointed out, however, by Osler J.A., in the Drummond Case[6],
at page 547, the only evidence there given was that of the clerk of assize for
the county of Brant who swore that the defendant Drummond had been called as a
witness on Kennedy's trial for murder and had been sworn by him as clerk of
assize; and he produced his record book containing entries shewing that the
defendant had given evidence at Kennedy's trial at which the alleged perjury
was committed. The only other evidence was that of the court stenographer who
related the evidence given by the accused at the Kennedy trial.

Neither the indictment on
which Drummond had been tried nor any copy, or sworn copy of it, was produced.

The court held that there was no
proper evidence of a fact essential to the proof of the crime charged, viz.,
that there had been a judicial proceeding in which the alleged perjury was
committed inasmuch as neither the indictment and formal record of such
proceeding or a certificate under s. 691  of the Criminal Code  had been
produced.

I am unable to find any conflict
between the decision in the Drummond Case[7]
and the case now before me. In the Drummond Case[8]
there was no record whatever produced. Here the copy of the pleadings made use
of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. This suffices to dispose
of the application for leave under s. 1024  (a).

[Page 83]

I should perhaps add that, as at
present advised, production at the trial of the judgment disposing of the
action of Brama v. Gurditta was not necessary since the perjury
was complete when the evidence was given at the trial and prosecution could
have been instituted for it and conviction had although no judgment had ever
been rendered in the civil action. Doubtless it would be better practice where
judgment has been pronounced that it should be put in in order to complete the
record.

Leave to appeal will accordingly
be refused.

January 18, 1927.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The defendant
renews his application for leave to appeal under s. 1024  (a) of the
Criminal Code , relying upon other opinions which have been delivered by judges
of the Appellate Division since his former motion for leave to appeal was
refused. As the case now stands three of the five members of the Appellate
Division (Martin, Galliher, and McPhillips JJ.A.) are of the opinion that it
was sufficiently proven at the trial that the defendant was a witness in a
judicial proceeding when he gave the evidence for the giving of which he has
been convicted of perjury. In the view of three members of the Appellate
Division (the Chief Justice, M. A. Macdonald and McPhillips JJ.A.), if the
proof was technically incomplete because of the omission to adduce evidence of
the writ of summons which began the civil action in which the alleged perjury
was committed,

no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had actually occurred (s. 1014 (2) ).

I find nothing in the added
opinions now before me to bring this case within the purview of s. 1024  (a).
The Drummond Case[9]
is again invoked by the applicant as the judgment of another court of appeal
which conflicts with the judgment appealed from. My reasons for not regarding
the case of Rex v. Drummond[10]
as ""a like case"" I have already stated.

The motion will be refused.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Conviction on charge of using
means to procure abortion (Cr. Code, s. 303)—Judge’s charge to jury—Misdirection
in a material matter—Appeal—Onus of Crown—Miscarriage of justice (Cr. Code, s. 1014
(1) (c)).

The judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario, 61 Ont. L.R. 147, affirming appellant’s conviction on
a charge of using means to procure abortion, contrary to s. 303 of the Cr.
Code, was reversed, and the conviction was set aside and a new trial
ordered, on the ground that there was non-direction, tantamount in the
circumstances to misdirection, in a material matter, in the trial judge’s
charge to the jury, in that he cast doubt, unwarranted on the evidence, upon
the fact of the girl’s menstruation shortly before the time of the acts
charged, and failed to direct their attention to its possible significance (as
bearing on the appellant’s defence that he was never aware of the girl’s pregnancy)
and also to the motives, consistent with innocence which might have actuated
the girl in consulting one W., a physician and surgeon, rather than the family
physician, and in presenting herself to him under an assumed married name.

Misdirection in a material matter having been
shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the court that the jury, charged
as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than
find the appellant guilty (Gouin v. The King, [1926] S.C.R. 539, at p. 543;
Allen v. The King, 44 Can. S.C.R. 331, at p. 339; Makin v. Att. Gen.
for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, at p. 70). That onus was not
discharged.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, by a majority, dismissed his appeal
from his conviction, upon trial by Logie J. and a jury, on the charge of using
means to procure abortion, contrary to s. 303  of the Criminal Code .

By the judgment now reported, the appeal was
allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground of
misdirection in the trial judge’s charge to the jury in certain respects
indicated in the judgment.

[Page 634]

the appellant.

E. Bayly K.C. for the respondent.

THE COURT.—A majority of the Court is of the
opinion that, in view of the unfortunate failure of the learned trial judge to
present to the jury the principal ground of defence put forward by the
appellant, his conviction cannot be sustained. As there is to be a new trial,
it is inadvisable to discuss the evidence in detail or to do more than indicate
what is regarded as the fatal defect in the charge.

The appellant is shewn by the evidence to have
been more or less connected with two occasions on which the girl, Ruth Dembner,
was “treated” by Dr. Withrow. He accompanied her to the doctor’s residence on
the evening of Tuesday the 8th of February, 1927, when the doctor states that
he made a physical examination, using a “dilator.” The appellant also brought
the girl to the Strathcona Hospital on the night of Friday, the 11th of
February, and she was admittedly operated on by Dr. Withrow on the following
(Saturday) morning.

That Ruth Dembner was in fact pregnant from some
time in January is clearly established; and that she was in fact operated on by
Dr. Withrow with intent to bring about an abortion is not open to question
here.

The defence of the appellant is that he was
never aware of Ruth Dembner’s pregnancy. There is no direct testimony that he
ever learned that fact, circumstantial evidence being relied upon by the Crown
to justify an inference of such knowledge. The appellant, on the other hand,
points to his knowledge that the girl had menstruated on the 28th of January
(deposed to by his father) as importing ignorance by him of the vital fact that
she had conceived. The fact of her menstruation is established by the
uncontradicted testimony of her mother and sister, called as crown witnesses,
and whose credibility is unimpeached. The medical testimony is that
menstruation during pregnancy is not uncommon.

The fair inference from these facts, it is
argued for the appellant, is that both he and the girl did not believe that she
was pregnant when she first visited Dr. Withrow on the evening of the 8th
of February. At all events, the fact of the menstruation and the significance
attached to it by the

[Page 635]

appellant should have been placed before the
jury by the learned trial judge in his charge at least as fairly and as clearly
as were the circumstances relied on by the Crown as implying guilty knowledge
and intent. Yet, while some emphasis was laid in the charge on the facts that
Ruth Dembner had passed over her family physician and had gone to Dr. Withrow,
an utter stranger, to be treated, as the defence claims, for dysmenorrhoea, and
that she had given her name to Dr. Withrow as “Mrs. Brooks,” nothing was
said of the suggested explanation offered for the appellant that she probably
wished to conceal the loss of her virginity from the family physician and that,
as that fact would be apparent to Dr. Withrow, she might have thought it would
be more convenient for her to give the name of a married woman.

The learned judge, instead of telling the jury,
as the evidence clearly warranted, that they should accept as undisputed the
girl’s menstruation in the end of January, cast doubt upon that fact, saying:
“The evidence, if any, was of menstruation,” and then, suggesting the
possibility of the issue of blood on the 28th of January having been due to
some earlier unlawful operation (of which there is not a scintilla of
evidence), he added:

The weight of that evidence (as to
menstruation); the credibility of it is for you; you are the judges of that.

After the jury had retired, counsel for the
appellant objected to the charge in these terms:

In charging the jury as to the evidence of
menstruation I was struck by the fact that you brushed it aside; you covered it
in such a way that you in effect used this expression in regard to that; you
must consider the weight of the evidence. You did not perhaps have present in
your mind at that time that the evidence consisted of the mother’s testimony
and the sister’s testimony.

Instead of recalling the jury and specifically
directing their attention to this matter as requested, the learned judge said:

But that was impressed upon the jury again
and again by you and Mr. Roebuck. Of course there was evidence that blood
had been seen on a pad, but all the girl said to her mother was—”It is the
usual.”

Mr. GREER: I have it down that the mother
actually saw it.

HIS LORDSHIP: It may be so but I do not
think any miscarriage will occur from that, because counsel reiterated that
only this morning to the jury.

Mr. GREER: Well you charged very
carefully, and it struck me that perhaps a proper sense of proportion…

HIS LORDSHIP: Any objection,
Mr. Roebuck?

Mr. ROEBUCK: I intend to make none.

[Page 636]

And yet the learned judge had, early in his
charge to the jury, said:

It is my duty, gentlemen, to lay the
defence fairly and completely before the jury, and I will do that a little
later * * *

To avoid any possible misapprehension, it should
be stated that, in the opinion of the Court, but for the defects in the charge
the appellant could not have successfully attacked his conviction. There was
quite enough evidence to warrant the jury upon an adequate charge, had they
seen fit to do so, drawing the inference of guilty knowledge and intention on
his part. But it is impossible to gauge the effect on the jury’s mind of
casting doubt upon the fact of the girl’s menstruation and of failing to direct
their attention to its possible significance and also to the motives,
consistent with innocence, which might have actuated the girl in consulting
Dr. Withrow rather than the family physician and in presenting herself to
him as “Mrs. Brooks.” If the jury, properly instructed as to these points,
regarded the first visit to Dr. Withrow on the 8th of February as made for
an innocent purpose and in ignorance by the girl and the appellant of her
pregnancy, as the Deputy Attorney General admitted they might, they would be
obliged to infer from what subsequently occurred that the appellant’s state of
mind and his intention changed and that when he brought the girl to the
hospital on the Friday evening (February 11) he did so with the object of
furthering a design on her part to undergo an operation to procure an abortion.
That it may seem probable to an appellate court perusing the record that the
jury would have reached that conclusion, does not warrant affirming the conviction.
That would, in effect, be to substitute the verdict of the court for that of a
jury properly instructed, to which the appellant was entitled. Misdirection in
a material matter having been shewn, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty. Gouin v. The King[2]; Allen v. The King[3]; Makin v. Att. Gen. for New South Wales[4]. That burden the Crown, in the view of the
majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non-direction by the
learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in

[Page 637]

the circumstances of this case to misdirection,
and constituting a miscarriage of justice within subs. 1 (c) of s. 1014 
of the Criminal Code . Upon the whole case, and taking into consideration
the entire charge, the majority of the Court, with respect, finds itself unable
to accept the view expressed by the learned judge who delivered the majority
judgment in the Appellate Division that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice can have occurred” at the trial (Criminal Code , s. 1014 (2) ).

Appeal allowed, conviction set aside
and new trial ordered.

Solicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae
& Greer.

Solicitor for the respondent: Edward

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

New trial—Discovery of new evidence as
ground for

A new trial, applied for on the ground that
new evidence has been discovered since the trial, should be granted only where
the new evidence proposed to be adduced could not have been obtained by
reasonable

[Page 73]

diligence before the trial and is such that,
if adduced, it would be practically conclusive. (Young v. Kershaw, 16
T.L.R. 52, at pp. 53-54, cited).

An action for specific performance of an
alleged agreement for sale of a “unit” in a mining syndicate was dismissed at
trial. Plaintiffs appealed, and, alternatively, asked for a new trial on the
ground of discovery of new evidence. The Appellate Division, Ont., without
passing on the main appeal, granted a new trial. Defendant appealed to this
Court and asked that the judgment at trial be affirmed.

Held: The new
trial should not have been granted; the proposed new evidence could have been
ascertained with reasonable diligence before the trial; also, it could not
conclusively establish plaintiff’s case, as the fact proposed to be proved
could not affect the judgment unless the relation of vendor and purchaser
existed between the parties, and this Court, on the evidence, sustained the
trial judge’s finding that that relation did not exist. The appeal was allowed,
and the judgment at trial, in its result, restored.

APPEAL by the defendant Varette from the
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, which
vacated and set aside the judgment of Masten J. dismissing the plaintiffs’
action, and ordered a new trial.

The action was for specific performance of an
agreement alleged to have been made by the defendant Varette for sale of a
“unit” in a certain mining syndicate, or, in the alternative, for damages for
failure to make delivery. Masten J. dismissed the action. The plaintiffs
appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, asking for
a reversal of the trial judgment, and in the alternative, for a new trial on
the ground of the discovery of new evidence. The Appellate Division did not
pass upon the main appeal, but granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial.
The defendant Varette appealed to this Court, and asked that the judgment of
Masten J. be affirmed. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated
in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed with costs, and the
judgment of Masten J. restored.

G.H. Kilmer K.C. and H.H. Davis for the
appellant.

W.N. Tilley K.C. and J.F. Boland for the
respondents.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

RINFRET J.—The Tremoy Lake Shore Mining
Syndicate owned certain mining claims in the province
 of Quebec. It had already
disposed of 90 per cent of its interests to the

[Page 74]

Noranda Mines Limited and the remaining 10 per
cent was also under option to the same company. This 10 per cent interest was
divided into 100 parts, called units or points; and between the members of the
syndicate—thirteen in all—these units or points were held in unequal
proportions formed of several entire units or portions of units. It was
understood that, pending the exercise of its option by the Noranda company,
each owner could deal with any of his units or portions of units as if they had
been shares in a company.

The Noranda Mines Limited had formed The Horne
Copper Corporation. For a time, and until the Noranda company exercised its
option, the 10 per cent interest was represented by shares of the Horne
corporation held by the syndicate in undivided ownership and evidenced by one
certificate of that corporation. For that reason, the units were sometimes
referred to as Horne units. A stock ledger was kept for the syndicate, in which
the names of the transferees of units or portions thereof were successively
registered.

The appellant Varette was a bookkeeper for a
firm of contractors in New Liskeard and acted as secretary-treasurer for the
syndicate. The respondents Sainsbury and Solloway were mining brokers of Toronto, having their offices together, and
jointly interested in making commissions out of the sale of these units.

On the 16th September, 1925, Solloway wrote to
Varette:

I phoned you last evening and wired you
to-day and am now awaiting a reply * * * I can place all
the units amongst my friends that you can let me have at a reasonable figure.
What I shall expect you to do is that you are in touch with the owners and you
can get a price from them, make a fair profit for yourself and pass them on to
me * * *.

No reply to this communication appears to have
been made by Varette.

Almost two months later, on November 10, Varette
wired to Solloway:

I have offered to-day for sale subject to
immediate acceptance one unit of Tremoy Lake Shore Mining Syndicate at $8,750
flat. If interested, wire at once.

Both parties agree that the telegram should be
read: “I am offered to-day, etc.” or “I have, offered to me to-day for sale * *
*, One unit, etc.”

[Page 75]

Solloway wired, on November 14, to Varette:

Will accept your offer on Noranda unit at
price quoted. Meet me on 47 to-morrow without fail as I cannot stop off.

The unit thus offered and accepted was
subsequently taken up and there is no controversy over it.

As agreed, Solloway met Varette at the New
Liskeard railway station, on the arrival of train no. 47. He confirmed the
purchase already made and expressed his desire to buy other units. Varette said
he might be able to send another; and it is this second unit that is the
subject of the present litigation.

Solloway was going into the north country and
expected to be away for a few weeks. He told Varette that, during his absence,
Sainsbury would act for him and would look after the units. By telegraph from
New Liskeard he advised Sainsbury in Toronto of the result of his interview with Varette and again, by letter
the same day from Ramore, a station further north. Telephone messages and
telegrams were afterwards exchanged between Sainsbury and Varette concerning
the forwarding of papers to complete the sale of the first unit and the
possibility of procuring other units.

On November 21, Varette sent a telegram
addressed to Solloway as follows:

Can offer one unit same price delivered Toronto Wednesday morning.

This telegram went to Sainsbury in due course
and the offer was accepted by telephone. At the same time, there was talk of a
third unit.

On the 26th November, Varette telegraphed:

One unit leaving twenty-seventh. Have still
one more. This will be the last available. Wire reply if satisfactory.

The “one unit leaving twenty-seventh” was the
second unit, which is the subject-matter of this action. The “one more” unit
referred to in the telegram was the third one, with which we are not concerned.

The second unit was never delivered. On November
30, Varette telegraphed:

Other parties have offered more money.
Cannot procure the unit offer (sic).

Sainsbury went to New Liskeard in an effort to
procure units himself from the holders. He was offered one at $9,500. He could
not go beyond $9,100, and could find none at that price.

[Page 76]

Sainsbury, having vainly attempted to procure
delivery of the second unit from Varette, brought action for specific
performance. He alleged he had entered into the agreement on behalf of C.A. Gentles
and D.M. Hogarth, and they were joined as co-plaintiffs. At the beginning of
the trial, Solloway was also added as a party plaintiff.

The action was dismissed by Masten J. on the
ground that its subject-matter was realty and the Statute of Frauds afforded a
sufficient defence. He also expressed the view that Varette “never agreed to
act as a personal or direct vendor,” but only “as an agent in securing offers
from members of the syndicate who were willing to sell one or more shares and
submit them to Solloway.”

The plaintiffs served the ordinary notice of
appeal praying for the reversal of the trial judgment. They subsequently served
a supplementary notice of motion to set aside the judgment upon the ground that
the learned trial judge had erred in refusing an application made by them at
the close of the trial to amend by claiming damages for breach of warranty of
authority; and, in the alternative, for a new trial on account of the discovery
of new evidence.

The Appellate Division did not pass upon the
main appeal, but granted the motion for a new trial.

Varette now appeals and submits that the
judgment of the trial judge should be affirmed. The respondents, while
upholding the order of the Appellate Division, contend that judgment should
have been given in their favour and their action should be maintained.

On an application for a new trial on the ground
that new evidence has been discovered since the trial, we take the rule to be
well established that a new trial should be ordered only where the new evidence
proposed to be adduced could not have been obtained by reasonable diligence
before the trial and the new evidence is such that, if adduced, it would be
practically conclusive. Young v. Kershaw[1].

The new evidence upon which the respondents
based their application was produced—as it had to be—before the Court of Appeal
and, for the present purpose, no other evidence can be relied on. The only new
disclosure it makes is the precise date of the sale of a unit to one Tim-

[Page 77]

mins. The fact of the sale itself had already
been stated by Varette in his examination for discovery and at the trial.
Counsel for respondents then had full opportunity of cross‑examination,
and the papers in respect of that transaction were produced. It was then
noticed that the document evidencing the Timmins’ sale did not bear a date; but it can hardly be contended that,
with reasonable diligence, such date could not have been ascertained before the
trial. The subsequent ascertainment of the exact date under those circumstances
was not, in our view, a discovery of new evidence within the rule of law
governing the right to a new trial.

But the respondents’ application lacked yet
another requirement, which is that the proposed new evidence would not
conclusively establish the plaintiffs’ case.

Even assuming that the unit sold to Timmins was
the same unit previously offered to Solloway on the 21st November—an assumption
at best doubtful upon the evidence of record—that fact could not affect the
judgment unless the relation of vendor and purchaser was proven to have existed
between Varette and Solloway or Sainsbury. The trial judge held that such
relation did not exist. The Appellate Division directed a new trial without
hearing counsel for Varette on that point. It now becomes the duty of this
court to consider that question.

The best way to approach this aspect of the case
is first to determine with which of the two Toronto mining brokers, Solloway or
Sainsbury, the appellant Varette contracted, if at all, in making the bargain
alleged in connection with the second unit. Before deciding upon the intention
of the parties to an agreement, it is, of course, necessary to ascertain who
the parties were.

In our view, Solloway was the man with whom
Varette made whatever bargain was made, and Sainsbury acted throughout merely
on behalf of Solloway.

It should first be noticed that Sainsbury and
Solloway both had desks in the same office in the Royal
 Bank Building. They were working together. In the words of Sainsbury:

The idea was that he (Solloway) had several
prospective buyers for a number of units and we were working together.

Q. You and Solloway were working together?
Yes.

[Page 78]

The proposition for the purchase of the second
unit came up during the conversation between Solloway and Varette at their
meeting at the New Liskeard railway station on November 15. The agreement
concerning the first unit was then concluded and Varette advised Solloway that
he might be able to “pick up” some other units. Solloway said he was going to Lightning River and
would be away possibly three weeks, but to send them down to his office, “that
he had a man in his office who would look after it the same as if he were
there.”

Prior to his leaving for the north, Solloway had
told Sainsbury about his relations with Varette. Sainsbury knew of Varette’s
letter to Solloway of November 10 concerning the first unit and of Solloway’s
reply of the 14th November that he would take the unit. On that date, Sainsbury
himself telephoned to Varette “to tell him of the circumstances that Solloway
was leaving and that he would take care of the business at this (the Toronto)
end * * * in Solloway’s place.” Further, Sainsbury knew
that Solloway was advising Varette to the same effect.

After his interview with Varette at New Liskeard,
on the 15th November, Solloway telegraphed to Sainsbury from Swastika:

One Horne unit (N.B.—That was the first
unit) going to Imperial Bank Monday at price quoted in letter stop Varette may
be able to send another unit end of week. Present this telegram to Wilkinson as
authority for you to get unit.

He confirmed this by letter from Ramore (another
railway station up north) on the same day:

I saw Varette and he promised me to send a
Horne Unit to Imperial Bank to-morrow at same price he wrote me and to try and get
me another unit by the end of the week.

I wired you from Swastika to 304 Royal
Bank. Now don’t fail to take up the unit and don’t fail to keep me a share of
your profit.

There is no use of wiring Varette for
units, as he will do his best to get another one.

Sainsbury admits that this letter made clear to
him that Varette was buying a unit for Solloway.

Varette got busy and on November 21 he was able
to telegraph the offer of the second unit:

Can offer one unit same price delivered Toronto Wednesday morning. Telephone me 157
New Liskeard.

This telegram was addressed to Solloway. In
accordance with his arrangements with the latter, Sainsbury re-

[Page 79]

ceived and opened the telegram. He thereupon
telephoned to Varette: “I got your wire addressed to Solloway.” He pretends
having then told Varette that “he was the buyer and not Solloway” and that
afterwards he went on to deal with Varette under his own name. This is denied
by Varette who swears positively that the offer was accepted “on behalf of Solloway.”
Varette’s statement was accepted by the trial judge, who said: “Where his
(Varette’s) evidence differs or varies from that of Sainsbury and Solloway, I
prefer the evidence of Varette.” On the record, we agree with the learned trial
judge and accept Varette’s version, which is more consistent with the course of
events and, moreover, does not present the difficulty involved in Sainsbury’s
story that he had taken advantage of Solloway’s absence and had broken faith
with him.

When Solloway returned, he wrote Varette that
Sainsbury had advised him that he was “sending two more units” and thanked him
“for this business.” On the whole, the conclusion must be that, in these
transactions, Sainsbury was “Solloway’s man.” So Varette understood; and, in
that he was perfectly justified. For that reason, he sent all his
communications to the office where Sainsbury was acting in Solloway’s place.
There is no doubt that Sainsbury completed the transaction in respect of the
first unit for Solloway’s account. He acted in the same capacity with regard to
the second unit. The agreement as to the latter, as in the case of the first
one, was a bargain between Varette and Solloway, represented by Sainsbury.

The other question to be determined is what was,
between Varette and Solloway, the agreement concerning this second unit. As
already stated, it took form during the interview of Varette with Solloway at
the New Liskeard railway station, on November 15. We have the account of that
interview in a letter written shortly afterwards by Varette and with which
Solloway expressed himself to be in complete accord. This letter derives
singular value from the fact that, at the time it was written, Sainsbury was
threatening suit. Solloway knew it and therefore was apt to be more careful in
his assent to Varette’s statements.

[Page 80]

It is nothing to the purpose that later, when
called as a witness, he attempted to explain away the force of this assent on
the ground that he had then no “knowledge of the telegrams that had passed
between Sainsbury and Varette.” Knowledge of those telegrams could have no
bearing on the question of what had been the original agreement between Varette
and Solloway and the nature of the relations thereby created between them. In
our view, moreover, these relations were not by the telegrams referred to
modified in any essential particular.

Upon returning from the North, Solloway had
written to Varette, on November 28:

Dear Mr. Varette,—I just returned to
the city yesterday and Mr. Sainsbury advised me that you are sending two
more units. I wish to thank you for this business and, upon receipt of this
letter, I wish you would kindly write and let me know if there are any other
units for sale and I shall be very grateful indeed if you will send on to me,
at the Imperial Bank, Adelaide and Victoria Sts. Branch, Toronto, any units
that come on the market, and advise me that they are coming.

Thanking you and hoping to hear from you at
your earliest convenience, I am,

                                                                                       Yours
very truly,

                                                                                                            I.W.C.
SOLLOWAY.

On December 13, Varette wrote:

Dear Mr. Solloway,—In going over my
correspondence to-night for filing, I run across yours of November 28. (We
leave out the passages having no reference to the point we are now discussing).

The day I met you at the Station I advised
I had one unit and you said to pick up any more available—that Sainsbury,
acting for you, would look after same.

I immediately set to work to obtain some
more—and got the promise of one and a partial promise on another, I did not
have them tied up—only a promise. In the meantime I wired Sainsbury, but also
in the meantime word came from Toronto that some one was offering more money and I could not get the
units. This offering of more money for four units, as far as I can find out,
was only talk.

I could not and have been unable so far to
obtain anything further. I do not feel that I was dealing with Sainsbury at
all, but with you under your instructions that Sainsbury was acting for you.

This is the exact position I am in at
present and I told Sainsbury, when he was here, I would do the best I could. He
advised that a writ would be issued against me if I did not produce.

On December 21, Solloway replied (and again we
leave out whatever is unnecessary):

Dear Mr. Varette,—I have been out of
town and received your letter of December 13 yesterday. I am expecting you into
the office should you

[Page 81]

come to Toronto and I will look forward with much pleasure to having a talk with
you.

* * *

I quite agree with what you say in your
letter and I do not see that they have any complaint to make. However I hope to
see you in the near future.

                                                                                       Yours
very truly,

                                                                                                            I.W.C.
SOLLOWAY.

As will therefore appear, both Solloway and
Varette agree on the crucial point that the understanding between them was not
an agreement to transfer and sell, but only an agreement to procure units “that
came on the market.” We have already stated that, to our mind, the subsequent
letters and telegrams exchanged with Sainsbury did not affect this original
agreement. They are all reproduced in this judgment. Taken as a whole and
viewed in the light of the initial interview with Solloway, they bear out the
view taken by the learned trial judge that “Varette never agreed to act as a
vendor of his own shares” and the relations of vendor and purchaser never
existed between Varette and Solloway.

The result is that the motion for a new trial
ought not to have been granted and that the appeal should be allowed, for the
reasons we have given. Our judgment does not imply approval of the application
made by the learned trial judge of the Statute of Frauds.

Nor do we express any opinion on the question of
misrepresentation by Varette of his authority as an agent. The trial judge gave
his reasons why he thought the amendment putting this claim forward should not
be permitted and he did so without prejudice to the right of either Sainsbury
or Solloway making this claim later. This was a matter of discretion with which
this court would interfere only under most exceptional circumstances, which are
not present in this case.

The appellant should have his costs here and in
the Court of Appeal and the judgment of Masten J. should be restored.

Appeal allowed with costs.

On
Appeal From The Court Of Appeal For British Columbia

Criminal law—Alien—Conviction
under Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923 (D.), c. 22, s. 4 (d)—Accused held for deportation under s. 25—Immigration
Act (D.) 1910, c. 27—Habeas corpus proceedings—Appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 139, s. 36, as enacted
1920, c. 82.

Where an alien has been
convicted, after his entry into Canada, of an offence under para. (d) of s. 4 of The Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, (D.), c. 22, and, after expiry or determination of
the period of

[Page 653]

imprisonment imposed upon him
on such conviction, he is held in custody awaiting deportation, under a warrant
showing on its face that he is so held as a consequence of such conviction,
under the authority of s. 25 of said Act, any "" proceedings for or upon a
writ of habeas corpus "" directed to bring him before the court in order
that the legality of his detention under such warrant may be enquired into, are
necessarily proceedings "" arising out of a criminal charge,"" and come
within the exception to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada under
s. 36 of The Supreme Court Act.

MOTION on behalf of His
Majesty the King for an order quashing the appeal brought by the defendant on
the ground that the court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because
the judgment from which the same is brought is a judgment in proceedings for or
upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a criminal charge. The facts are
sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.

The defendant's appeal was from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
dismissing an appeal from an order of Morrison J., refusing, on the return to
an order nisi for habeas corpus, to release the defendant from close
custody under an order or warrant of deportation, dated 21st March, 1923, made
by the Deputy Minister of Immigraton and Colonization.

O. M. Biggar, K.C. for the motion.

W. Schroeder contra.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The respondent
moves to quash this appeal on the ground that it is an appeal ""in
proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a criminal
charge"" within the exception to the jurisdiction of this court made by s.
36 of the Supreme Court Act (as amended 1920, c. 32).

The appellant is an alien and was
convicted after his entry into Canada of an offence under para. (d) of s. 4 of The
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923. Section 25 of that statute enacts that
any alien so convicted

shall, upon the expiry or
sooner determination of the imprisonment imposed on such conviotion, be kept in
custody and deported in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act
relating to enquiry, detention and deportation.

[Page 654]

The warrant on which the
appellant is held in custody awating deportation shews on its face that he is
so held, no doubt under the authority of s. 25 of The Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, 1923, as a consequence of his conviction of an offence against
para. (d) of s. 4 of that statute. The scope of any enquiry under The
Immigration Act in such a case must be limited to ascertaining officially
that the person in question was an alien, that he had been convicted after       his
entry into Canada of an offence within the ambit of s. 25 and that the period
of imprisonment imposed upon him on such conviction had expired or been
determined. It follows, in our opinion that any "" proceedings for or upon
a writ of habeas corpus "" directed to bring the convicted alien before the
court in order that the legality of his detention under such warrant may be
enquired into are necessarily proceedings "" arising out of a criminal
charge "" within the meaning of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act.

It is nihil ad rem that
the alien has served the sentence imposed on him, except that the expiry or
determination of his term of imprisonment is by s. 25 made a pre-requisite to
the custody for, and the deportation which it ordains. The statute, in addition
to such imprisonment as may be imposed, subjects him as a result of his
conviction and, therefore, as something directly flowing from the judicial
finding of his guilt of the criminal charge laid against him, to the further
consequences prescribed by s. 25. It is impossible to say that the custody and
deportation imperatively ordered by that enactment do not "" arise out of
the criminal charge"" of which the alien was convicted; it is equally
impossible to maintain that curial proceedings to enquire into the legality of
the detention pending deportation do not likewise so arise.

The motion to quash is granted.

Motion granted.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Trial judge—Charge to
jury—Indirect comment on failure of accused to testify—Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. (1906), c. 145, s. 4, subs. 5.

The appellant was charged with the murder of
his mother. The trial judge, in instructing the jury, made the following
remarks: “The doctor who made the autopsy has declared that the death must have
occurred at

[Page 113]

seven o’clock in the
morning or even before. The accused was at that time in the house according to
his own declaration to police officers. The accused was then alone with his
mother when she was killed; and if so, the defence should have been able to
explain by whom the murder has been committed, because such a brutal murder
could not have been committed without the knowledge of the accused.”

Held that,
although (the language of the charge might be understood1 as
relating to a failure of the accused to give an explanation to police officers
or others, it is also easily and naturally capable of being under stood as
relating to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the
trial; and therefore such language is obnoxious to the imperative direction of
subs. 5 of s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  which requires the trial judge
to abstain from any comment upon the failure of an accused to take advantage of
the privilege which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own
behalf. The accused is entitled to a new trial.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant for murder.

The material facts of the case and the
question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. and J. E. Bédard K.C. for the appellant.

Arthur Fitzpatrick K.C. and V. Bienvenu K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Duff J.—As a new trial is necessary, and since the crime with which the
accused is charged is one of the greatest gravity, it is important to adhere
rigorously to the practice of refraining from any comment on the circumstances of the case, beyond that which is strictly
necessary in order to elucidate the point upon which the decision of the appeal
turns.

It should be said at the outset that the
jurisdiction of this court rests upon the dissent of Mr. Justice Allard, and in
particular upon his view, in which he was not in agreement with his colleagues,
that the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had failed to observe
the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act , which,
in effect, requires the trial judge to abstain from any comment upon the failure
of the accused to take advantage

[Page 114]

of the privilege which the law gives him to be a
witness at the trial in his own behalf.

The learned trial judge said:

Le docteur Marois a fait l’autopsie à trois heures et quart, et si vous croyez son
témoignage (c’est un homme dont le témoignage a du poids), il a déclaré que la
mort avait dû arriver à sept heures, ou à six heures et même avant, du matin.

Voilà les circonstances qui enveloppent la
mort de la défunte.

Si la mort, mes amis, remonte à six heures ou
à sept heures du matin, où était l’accusé à ce moment-là, vers sept heures ou
six heures du matin, même plus à bonne heure? A la maison. A la maison. Car,
d’après sa propre déclaration, il n’est sorti qu’à huit heures du matin.

Il était donc seul avec sa mère à la maison
quand la mort est arrivée et si l’accusé était seul avec sa mère quand elle a
été tuée et égorgée, la défense aurait dû être capable d’expliquer par qui ce
meurtre a été commis. Car une pareille boucherie n’a pas dû se faire, sans que
l’accusé en eut connaissance.

It seems to be reasonably clear that, according
to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more natural and
probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure of la défense to explain who committed the
murder would, having regard to the circumstances emphasized by the learned
trial judge, be this, namely, that it related to the failure of the accused to
testify upon that subject at the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such
language might be understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to
police officers or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and
naturally capable of being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly
obnoxious to the enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145. The
law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart
in Rex v. Gallagher[1], in
these words:

* * * it is not what the judge intended but
what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.

There must be a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Misdirection—Evidence—Similar acts—Admissibility—Corroboration—Accomplices

The appellants
were convicted of the murder of the captain of the boat Beryl G.
containing a cargo of liquor intended to be illegally delivered in the United
States. The appellants, with two others, set forth in a boat called Denman
II and left for Sidney Island with the intention of taking from the Beryl
G. her cargo of liquor. According to the story of one of the appellants and
an accomplice the Beryl G. was towed from Sidney Island by the Denman
II, and the bow anchor, having been detached was sunk with the bodies of
the captain and of his son, which had been fastened together by a pair of
handcuffs. It had been proven that Baker had bought a yachtman's cap with a
white top and ornamented profusely with gold braid in order to give himself the
appearance of a revenue officer, and that this cap, together with two revolvers


[Page 93]

and handcuffs
and a flashlight had been brought by Baker on board the Denman II. The
case against Baker, as exhibited in the evidence on behalf of the Crown, was
that in concert with the others he attacked the crew of the Beryl G.,
under the pretence that he and his associates were officers of the law, one of
them being disguised in such a way as to present the appearance of a revenue
officer, and the party being equipped. with and displaying such arms and
implements as such officers might be expected to use in dealing with the
possessors of a contraband cargo of liquor. Evidence was offered by the Crown
in rebuttal, of the fact that Baker on one occasion recently, and on another at
a considerably earlier date, had employed similar equipment and precisely this
ruse for the purpose of deceiving and disarming the opposition of bootleggers
while he took over their illegal possessions.

Held that, as bearing upon the issue thus
raised (as to design) it was relevant to shew a similar use of such implements
by Baker on a recent occasion—within a month ; and, such evidence
being given, evidence of the use of similar implements in a similar way on an
earlier occasion, several years before, would be admissible as tending to
establish a practice.

Quaere whether the admission of such evidence
could be supported on the ground that it tended to corroborate the evidence of
the accomplices.








Held, also, that the criticism against the
trial judge's charge to the jury—that he insufficiently warned the jury
as to the risk of finding a verdict against the accused on the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice—possessed little or no importance when
considered in light of the undisputed and indisputable facts proven or admitted
by the accused.

APPEALS from
the judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming the
convictions of the appellants of the crime of murder.



The material facts
of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note
and in the judgment now reported.

R. V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant
Baker.

Austin O'Connor for the appellant
Sowash.

J.A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.



The judgment of the court was
delivered by



DUFF J.—When the undisputed and indisputable facts are understood
and the course of the trial is appreciated, it becomes evident that only two
questions of any importance are raised by these appeals. The first concerns a
criticism directed against the charge of the learned trial judge, and the
second concerns the admissibility of certain evidence offered by the Crown in
rebuttal. Both these questions must be considered in light of the evidence and
the issues to which it was directed. Though the evidence is volum-

[Page 94]



inous, the case is
not a complicated one, and the essential facts and the critical points in
controversy at the trial can be easily grasped.










In the summer and
autumn of 1924, one Marinoff, who lived in Tacoma, was engaged in running
liquor from British Columbia into the state of Washington. One Willis kept a
stock of liquor in a boat-house near Barclay, on the west coast of Vancouver
Island, and Marinoff was a purchaser from him. In the early days of September,
Marinoff purchased from Willis 350 "" cases,"" so called, of Scotch
whisky and gin, and it was arranged that, according to a practice followed in
the execution of previous sales, the liquor should be sent in the Beryl G.,
manned by William Gillis and his son, to an anchorage in a cove at Sidney
Island, which is an island situated a little west of the boundary line between
Canada and the United States running through Haro Strait, there to be delivered
to Marinoff's agents. The Beryl G., with her cargo, duly arrived at the
appointed place, and about five or six o'clock in the evening on the 15th of
September, 110 cases out of this cargo were delivered to Marinoff's agents, and
reached his hands in due course in the United States. Marinoff's agents left
the Beryl G. anchored (with one bow anchor weighing from 100 to 150
pounds, and a much lighter one at the stern), with the intention of returning
for the remainder of the cargo. Two days later the Beryl G. was
discovered a few miles from Sidney Island, adrift. The bow anchor had
disappeared, her cargo was gone, and the craft presented unmistakable
indications of a sanguinary struggle. Neither of the Gillises has been seen or
heard of since, and the appellants have been convicted of the murder of the
father.



In the first week
of September, the appellants, Baker and Sowash, together with Stromkins, who
was the principal witness for the Crown at the trial, and one Charlie Morris,
were in Victoria (whither they had come from Seattle) ; and it is admitted by
Baker and Sowash that, as Stromkins testifies, they then had in view jointly an
expedition to the west coast of Vancouver Island, with the object of taking
possession of liquor they hoped to find cached in places said to have been
disclosed to them as likely places by the customs officials and the provincial 

[Page 95]










police of British
Columbia. The police had, Baker insists in his evidence, assured them through
one Majowski, a detective from Seattle, that, such liquor having been illegally
in the possession of persons who had hidden it, and having been hidden for
illegal purposes, anybody who should find it might take it without violating
the law of British Columbia, and get it into the United States if he could. This
comparatively harmless design was one, at least, of the objects of the
expedition. They set forth in a boat owned by Stromkins, called Denman II,
and coasted as far north as Port Renfrew, but returned on the 12th or 13th to
Esquimalt empty handed. They remained in Victoria until the night of the 15th,
when they, that is to say, Baker, Sowash, Charlie Morris and Stromkins, started
from Cadboro Bay in the Denman II. Baker says that from Cadboro Bay they
went direct to Anacortes, in the state of Washington, and there parted company.
Stromkins and Sowash say that, on Baker's proposal, or the proposal of Baker
and Morris, they left for Sidney Island with the intention of taking from the Beryl
G., whose anchorage was well known, her cargo of liquor; that this purpose
was carried out; that William Gillis and his son were killed in the course of
its execution ; that the liquor was cached in various places, some on the beach
at Sidney Island, some on Gooch Island, some on South Pender Island and some on
Moresby Island (though as to this there is some discrepancy between the
evidence of Stromkins and that of Sowash).



As regards this
whole chapter of events, to which Stromkins and Sowash testified—from the departure, at ten o'clock on the evening of the
15th, until the disposal of the liquor was completed—Baker advanced a blank denial. Not only did he say that
he was not there himself, but that Denman II. and Stromkins and his passengers
were all elsewhere—en voyage from Cadboro Bay to
Anacortes; that this part of the story of Stromkins and Sowash is pure
fabrication. Two or three days after the 16th of September, when, according to
the story of Baker, as well as that of Sowash and Stromkins, all had arrived at
Anacortes, and Baker, Sowash and Morris had separated from Stromkins, leaving
him with his boat, Baker admits that he, with Sowash and Morris, made
arrangements with one Clausen, 

[Page 96]










of Seattle, to go
to the British Columbia islands and bring whisky and gin cached there to the
American side, on the terms that Clausen was to receive for his services
one-third of the liquor recovered ; and that with Clausen, he and Sowash set
out on this expedition from Seattle, on the 18th or 19th. They first went to
Moresby Island and, under the direction of Baker, discovered and took away with
them some twenty cases of whisky and gin, containing 12 quart bottles each,
which, however, they were obliged to throw overboard under pressure of pursuit
by an American revenue cutter. After this misadventure, they entered Lake
Union, where Clausen's boat, the Dolphin, was allowed to lie for about a
week, when they, Clausen, Baker and Sowash, set forth again, and this time they
went to Sidney Cove, on the northeast side of Sidney Island, and, under the
direction of Baker, discovered on the beach above high water mark, a lot of
eighteen cases of Scotch whisky and gin (the exact quantity of such liquor
which Stromkins states was left above high water mark in this locality on the
night of the 15th out of the looted cargo of the Beryl G.) ; two lots of
the same kind of liquor on Gooch Island, and another on South Pender Island.
All these various lots were together brought to a place on South Pender Island,
and deposited there. The liquor so collected was later—in part with the assistance of Clausen, in part with the
assistance of one Smith—introduced into Washington state and
apparently was sold, under the direction of Baker, who controlled the
distribution of the proceeds and still held, at the time of the trial, he
declared, $3,200 for Stromkins as his share. It should be mentioned that the
liquor which constituted the cargo of the Beryl G. was done up in sacks,
described by the witnesses as "" cases,"" of 12 quart bottles each, of
Scotch whisky or gin; and it is undisputed that all the whisky and gin
recovered from the various places of deposit visited under the direction of
Baker by Clausen, Baker and Sowash was in such sacks, except where the sacks
had been ruptured by the action of the water.



Before proceeding
to notice the grounds of appeal, some additional facts, as well as some
passages in the evidence which are not undisputed, should be mentioned.
According to the story of Stromkins and Sowash, the Beryl G. was towed
from Sidney Island to Halibut Island on the

[Page 97]



night of the 15th
by Denman II, and the bow anchor, having been detached, was sunk with
the bodies of the Gillises, father and son, which had been fastened together by
a pair of handcuffs. These handcuffs, as well as a flashlight, which he used in
boarding the Beryl G., had been in possession of Baker, who also had
with him on board the Denman II at least two revolvers, with one of
which he shot the elder Gillis. It was shewn that there was, on the 16th, a
wind prevailing in the vicinity of Halibut Island of about 36 miles an hour,
and expert evidence was given to the effect that the Beryl G., when
sighted on the 17th, was approximately in a position where, having regard to
the weather and the tides, she might be expected to be found if left on the
night of the 15th, as in the testimony was averred, in the vicinity of Halibut
Island with only her stern anchor holding her. Before leaving Seattle for
Victoria, Baker bought a yachtsman's cap with a white top and ornamented
profusely with gold braid, on the advice, as he said, of Clausen, who suggested
that he might use it in a critical juncture to disarm suspicion by giving
himself the appearance of a revenue officer. Stromkins and Sowash say that this
cap, together with the revolvers, the handcuffs and the flashlight mentioned
above, were brought by Baker on board the Denman II on the night of the
15th. Baker denies that he ever had in his possession handcuffs or a
flashlight, and he asserts that for many years before the trial he had not
carried a revolver.










The criticism
directed against the learned trial judge's charge to the jury—that he insufficiently warned the jury as to the risk of
finding a verdict against the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an
accomplice,—is seen to possess little or no
importance when considered in light of the facts. The learned trial judge did
explain in a most unexceptionable way that the evidence of an accomplice must
be weighed and examined with care and suspicion, and that although the jury
might convict on such evidence, it would be dangerous to do so. He did
explicitly warn the jury that Sowash must be treated as an accomplice, although
he did fail to give in express terms the same warning as to Stromkins. A
passage in his charge, in which he says in so many words that Sowash
corroborates Stromkins, obviously relates exclusively to the Crown's case
against 

[Page 98]



Sowash himself,
and directs attention to Sowash's own admissions. The learned trial judge did
not, it is true, explain to the jury that corroboration in the relevant sense
means corroboration not only in respect of some fact tending to shew that the
crime was committed, but also in respect of some evidence implicating or
tending to implicate the accused.



Indeed, there is
perhaps reason to impute to the charge some tendency to mislead in a sense
unfavourable to the accused in this respect, as well as in the explicit
labelling of Sowash as an accomplice as contrasted with the absence of any such
description of Stromkins in so many words ; and had the corroboration which the
jury actually had before them been either scanty or of questionable weight, it
might have been necessary to consider the probable effect of these features of
the learned judge's observations with some care.



But the learned
trial judge would have done much less than justice to the force of the
uncontroverted facts—facts established by the admissions of
the appellants or by independent and unchallenged evidence—if he had led the jury to believe that they were at
liberty to regard the evidence of Stromkins in its essential elements or of
Sowash in so far as it implicated Baker as destitute of corroboration.
Considering the gravity of the crime, corroboration of real substance and
weight was no doubt demanded, but it was produced in superfluity. Sowash's case
requires no comment; indeed, as to this point, is hardly susceptible of useful
comment. As concerns Baker's case, there was one capital issue and one only,
for the jury to pass upon. As already intimated, that issue was simply this:
Was the narrative of Stromkins and Sowash dealing with the trip of the Denman
II to Sidney Island on the night of the 15th and the attack on the Beryl
G., and the subsequent disposal of the cargo, a fabrication from beginning
to end, or was it not? That is to say, was Baker's story of the uneventful
crossing to Anacortes the true story? If this issue were found against Baker,
that would be the end of the controversy.










First must be
noticed the evidence of Clausen, who deposes to a conversation with Baker, in
which Baker told him the liquor they were collecting was the cargo of the

[Page 99]



Beryl G., which he and his associates had taken
by force. The killing was not admitted, Baker's story being that the Gillises
had been marooned on one of the islands. But this evidence of Clausen, if
believed, was of course, as touching the real issue raised by Baker's defence—as to the attack on the Beryl G., from the Denman
II—conclusive against Baker. Clausen, of
course, was deeply involved with Baker by his association with him in the collection
and sale of the cargo after he became aware, according to his own account, that
he was dealing with goods procured by acts of robbery and violence. But however
justly suspicious one may be that we are not in possession of the whole story
of Clausen's relations with Baker, there is no evidence in the juridical sense
that Clausen was from the beginning a party to Baker's design (Clausen's loan
to Baker proves nothing) ; and, whatever might have been the position if Baker
had been charged with another offence, there is no ground for treating Clausen
for our present purpose as an accomplice in the murder.



Clausen's
statement is denied by Baker. But Baker, confronted with the necessity of
producing an alternative explanation of his expeditions with Clausen and Sowash
in the Dolphin, gives an explanation of which it is only necessary to
say that in itself it is a highly improbable one and destitute of a shred of
support from independent sources.



It is in the light
of this improbable explanation of Baker's that the corroborative cogency of the
admissions of Baker and Sowash must be weighed; and in light of it, the facts
already mentioned, the venture as originally conceived, the departure of all
the conspirators together on the night of the 15th, the concerted action of all
but Stromkins in the recovery of the liquor, the situation of the caches,
indicating that they had been selected under stress of emergency, Baker's
knowledge of their situation, all tend strongly to confirm the conclusion that
the collection of the liquor from these places was only one of the latest steps
in execution of a design with which the party set out.



Had Baker not been
called as a witness, and had the facts admitted in his own evidence been put in
evidence through the testimony of an independent witness, could it have been
suggested either that Stromkins or Sowash was an 








[Page 100]



uncorroborated
witness as against Baker, or even that upon that subject any question could
possibly arise? His own admissions were conclusive in a higher degree than the
testimony of any other witness could be; and his explanation, given by himself,
cannot be said to weaken the case against him. There seems little room for
doubt that the accused suffered no substantial wrong because the trial judge
did not more elaborately discuss the subject of corroboration with the jury. So
also, in face of the admissions of Baker and Sowash, it seems idle to suggest
prejudice resulting either from the refusal to postpone the trial or the
admission of the memorandum of proposed evidence which got into the hands of
the jury.



A question
remains, however, which requires careful examination, and that is the question
affecting the admissibility of the evidence, adduced in rebuttal, of the
witnesses Johnston and Marinoff. It seems impossible to support the admission
of this evidence as going to credit alone; the rule is rudimentary that, except
in certain well-known classes of cases within which the present case does not
fall, a cross-examiner is bound to accept the answers of the witness unless the
testimony so given is in itself relevant to one of the issues between the
parties. Subject, at all events, to a qualification which seems to be open to
question (Thompson v. The King[1],
namely, that the admission of the testimony in question could be supported on
the ground that it tended to corroborate the evidence of Stromkins and Sowash,
the point to be considered is whether this evidence was in the legal sense
relevant to any issue between the Crown and Baker. The view taken by some of
the judges in the court below may, perhaps, be put in this way: The case
against Baker, as exhibited in the evidence on behalf of the Crown, was that in
concert with the others he attacked the crew of the Beryl G., under the
pretence that he and his associates were officers of the law, one of them being
disguised in such a way as to present the appearance of a revenue officer, and
the party being equipped with and displaying such arms and implements as such
officers might be expected to use in dealing with the possessors of a contraband
cargo of liquor. Evi-

[Page 101]










dence, therefore,
of the fact that Baker on one occasion recently, and on another at a
considerably earlier date, had employed similar equipment and precisely this ruse
for the purpose of deceiving and disarming the opposition of bootleggers while
he took over their illegal possessions, was admissible on the same principle as
the possession of the ordinary implements of burglary would be admissible to
prove a charge implicating the accused in a burglary in which such implements
had been used.



This seems at
first sight to be open to some criticism. It may be said that the issue was not
whether Baker was personally implicated in an act of piracy involving murder,
in which such implements and methods were employed, or, in other words, whether
Baker was present and took part in an attack on the Beryl G. from the Denman
II ; the issue of substance was: Did any such attack take place at all? The
evidence establishing that such methods were employed establishes, if accepted,
that the crime was committed, as Stromkins and Sowash say it was—and that being established, there could be, as between
the Crown and Baker, no substantial issue left. This criticism appears,
however, when analyzed, to go to the form in which the view is expressed,
rather than to the substance of it. It can be stated in another form, when, as
will appear, the criticism seems to miss the mark.



The principle of
law to be applied is hardly in doubt, but the most apt statement of it for the
present purpose is, I think, to be found in the judgment of Lord Sumner (in
which Lord Parker concurred), in Thompson's Case[2],
in these passages:—



No one doubts
that it does not tend to prove a man guilty of a particular crime to show that
he is the kind of man who would commit a crime, or that he is generally
disposed to crime and even to a particular crime; but, sometimes for one reason
sometimes for another, evidence is admissible, notwithstanding that its general
character is to show that the accused had in him the makings of a criminal, for
example, in proving guilty knowledge, or intent, or system, or in rebutting an
appearance of innocence which, unexplained, the facts might wear. In cases of
coining, uttering, procuring abortion, demanding by menaces, false pretences and
sundry species of frauds, such evidence is constantly and properly admitted.
Before an issue can be said to be raised, which would permit the introduction
of such evidence so obviously prejudicial to the accused, it must have been
raised in substance if not in so many words,

[Page 102]










and the issue
so raised must be one to which the prejudicial evidence is relevant. The mere
theory that a plea of not guilty puts everything material in issue is not
enough for this purpose. The prosecution cannot credit the accused with fancy
defences in order to rebut them at the outset with some damning piece of
prejudice. No doubt it is paradoxical that a man, whose act is so nakedly
wicked as to admit of no doubt about its character, may be better off in regard
to admissibility of evidence than a man whose acts are at any rate capable of
having a decent face put upon them, and that the accused can exclude evidence
that would be admissible and fatal if he ran two defences by prudently
confining himself to one. Still, so it is ***



I certainly
do not think it could be held that, as a matter of course, even in the case of
crimes of this class, the articles found in a man's possession, not as parts of
the transaction which is being enquired into, but at a separate time and place,
could, as such, be put in evidence against him merely because they were such as
criminals possess or use, and in the absence of any circumstance in the crime
tending to show specific connection between it and the articles in question. If
a man could be convicted of a particular burglary, in which it was clear that
no tools had been used at all, merely because at another place and time
burglar's impleplements were found on his premises, it is difficult to see what
limit could be put to the admissibility of general evidence of bad character,
and the fact that evidence of articles found on the premises of accused persons
is constantly given without much question, though I doubt not in the vast
majority of cases quite rightly, is really only misleading, unless at the same
time we ask the question what exactly does this purport to prove and by what
probative nexus does it seek to prove it. *** All lawyers recognize, as part of
their professional premises, that there is all the difference in the world
between evidence proving that the accused is a bad man and evidence proving
that he is the man. Laymen are apt to think that the difference, if any,
is in favour of admitting the former. There must be something to connect the
circumstance tendered in evidence, not only with the accused, but with his
participation in the crime.



Was there, then,
an issue before the jury in respect of which the impeached testimony was
relevant in the sense indicated in these passages in Lord Sumner's judgment? I
think there was. At a very early stage the Crown pointedly raised the issue by
eliciting from Stromkins evidence indicating that the design with which Baker
and his companions became associated was not limited to the comparatively
harmless one of picking up unguarded deposits of liquor without resorting to
violent measures; but to take such liquor whenever a convenient opportunity
arose, and if necessary to employ force and to facilitate success by the
stratagem said to have been actually put into effect. Evidence was adduced of
Baker's purchase of a cap and, as already mentioned, of his possession of
revolvers and a flashlight and handcuffs, and of a significant remark by him on
sighting the Beryl G. at the mouth of Sooke Har-

[Page 103]










bour. It would
have been competent to the Crown to call evidence of a practice among criminals
of Baker's class to use such implements in the way suggested, as tending to
shew that the possession of them was not accidental or innocent. The possession
of the implements, especially if so supplemented, would be evidence that the
design of the expeditions and of the whole venture on which they were engaged
was as the Crown contended. It is within the principle of the observations
quoted, and of the decision of this Court in Brunet v. The King[3],
and of that of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Armstrong[4],
to hold that, as bearing upon the issue thus raised (as to design) it was
relevant to shew a similar use of such implements by Baker on a recent occasion—within a month; and such evidence being given, it would
appear that evidence of the use of similar implements in a similar way on an
earlier occasion, several years before, would be admissible as tending to
establish a practice. The existence of such a design would in itself be
relevant on the cardinal issue whether, when the party left Cadboro Bay, Baker
having these implements with him, they left with the intention of attacking the
Beryl G. or crossing to Anacortes direct.



An objection was raised
concerning the admissibility of a passage in Stromkins' evidence professing to
report a remark made by Morris to Stromkins on the Denman II immediately
after the killing of the Gillises which, perhaps, deserves a word of notice.
Morris' remark consisted in the exclamation, ""The cold-blooded
murderers!"" The admissibility of this evidence does not, in view of the
circumstances, appear to be open to serious doubt. The learned trial judge was
entitled to find, for the purpose of determining the question of admissibility,
that the criminal acts of Baker and Sowash, to which Stromkins had testified,
were within the scope of the objects of a conspiracy with which Morris was
identified, and identified so narrowly as to constitute him the alter ego
of Baker and Sowash in relation to the incidents of the crime and
contemporaneous comments upon them. In point of law, such a comment, uttered in
such circumstances by Morris, was, as the learned trial judge was entitled, for
that purpose,

[Page 104]



to find, the
comment of the appellants. (Rex v. Brandreth [5],

ON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA

Findings of trial judge—Duty of appellate court—Agency

[Page 144]

It is for an appellate court to ascertain whether there is
evidence upon which the trial judge could find, as he did find, and if there be
evidence of the facts found to which he could reasonably give effect, having
due regard to the weight of the evidence, it is for the court to consider
further whether his finding is based upon any misdirection occasioning a
substantial miscarriage of justice, or the judgment, in the light of the
evidence, and having regard to the course of the trial, discloses any error of
law; and, if there be no error in these particulars, the judgment should be
permitted to stand.

[Page 145]

The appellants sought to recover $6,000 as money lent. Their
transactions were with the respondent, C. R. Tufford, and the liability of the
other respondents depended upon the agency of Tufford. The judgment at the
trial proceeded upon the view that all three respondents were jointly and
severally liable.

Held that while, if the agency were established, there
might be an alternative liability, that liability continued only until the
election of the appellants to accept one, either the principal or the agent, as
their debtor and then only he could be sued to judgment.

Held, in view of the facts, that the appellants might
elect to have judgment against the respondents, the C. R. Tufford Company,
Limited, or C. R. Tufford, but that, as against the other respondent, the Delta
Company, Limited, the appeal should be dismissed, because there was no proof
that either of the respondents was authorized to borrow on its credit.

AN APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Ives.

The judgment appealed from was reversed in part.

The facts are fully stated in the judgment now reported.

Maclean K.C. for the appellant.

Woods K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

NEWCOMBE J.—The Delta Copper Company, one of the
defendants (respondents), was in possession of a copper mine in British
Columbia which it was endeavouring to develop under an option to purchase, and
it was trying to raise the necessary capital for the purchase and development
of the property by the sale of shares of its capital stock. The defendant, C.
R. Tufford, Ltd., was the exclusive agent for the sale of these shares upon the
terms of a written agreement of 12th February, 1917, and the defendant, C. R.
Tufford, was the president of the latter company and the agent and director of
its activities in the sale of the stock. The head offices of the two defendant companies
were established at Edmonton, where the defendant, C. R. Tufford, who was a
broker, also had his office. The plaintiffs (appellants) resided at Caledonia
in Ontario; they had acquired some of the stock of the Delta Company in
December, 1916. In the following spring the defendant, Tufford, went to Ontario
for the purpose of disposing of the stock or a portion of the stock which the
Tufford Company was authorized to sell, and in April and

[Page 146]

the early part of May he had some
interviews with the plaintiffs at Caledonia. Payments upon the Delta Company's
option to purchase were accruing, and the defendant Tufford Company's agency
for sale of the shares was conditional upon the making of sales and payment of
the proceeds to the Delta Company in fixed amounts within the times limited
therefor by the agency agreement; one of the provisions being that if the agent
paid or procured to be paid to the Delta Company, in respect of shares sold
under the terms of the agreement, the sum of $10,000, on or before 15th May,
1917, the agreement should continue until 15th June, 1917. Upon the former
date, 15th May, 1917, it was also necessary for the Delta Company to make a
considerable payment in order to save its rights under its option of purchase.
The defendant, Tufford, in addition to his interest in the business of stock
selling under the agency agreement, was a shareholder of the Delta Company,
either individually or through the Tufford Company, of which he was president
and had the control. In these circumstances it was necessary to provide $10,000
on or before 15th May. Negotiations took place between Tufford and the
plaintiffs which resulted in the latter paying to the former, on that day, an
amount of $6,000, which was immediately transmitted to Tufford, Ltd., at
Edmonton, and by that company paid to the Delta Company, and 6,000 shares of
the Delta Company's stock were then allotted to and placed in the name of the
plaintiff, Moore, in trust. The main question at issue is as to whether this
payment was made by the plaintiffs as a loan upon the security of the stock, or
as consideration for the purchase of the stock. There was an agreement in
writing executed at the time between Tufford, party of the first part, and the
plaintiffs, parties of the second part, whereby it was mutually agreed:

That the party of the first part hereby agrees to sell six
thousand shares of capital stock of the Delta Copper Company, Limited (N.P.L.)
standing in the name of Thos. G. Moore in trust for the parties of the second
part at or for the price of six thousand dollars on or before three months from
date in the following manner, namely, one thousand shares within thirty days
from date, two thousand shares within sixty days from date, and the balance
within three months from date, and to prove his good faith he hereby agrees to
deposit five thousand shares of his own stock in above described company with
said Thos. G. Moore as trustee, said stock to be forfeited if party of first
part does not carry out his agreement. Provided party of the first part does
carry out his agreement

[Page 147]

his five thousand shares are
released by above mentioned trustee to said party of first part, and said party
of first part immediately transfers one thousand of said shares to each of the
parties of the second part, thereby liquidating any and all claims which the
parties or any of them of the second part have or may have whatsoever against
party hereto of first part.

The plaintiffs, Murray and Moore,
testified in effect that they and their associates had, previously to 15th May,
purchased all the stock of the Delta Company which, at the time, they were
willing or could afford to purchase; that therefore they declined to entertain
Tufford's solicitation for the purchase of further stock, but that they finally
yielded to his entreaties for assistance in the urgent circumstances of the
case, so far as to agree to lend the sum of $6,000, upon the security of the
6,000 shares, and subject to the terms mentioned in the agreement, which amount
they borrowed from Thomas Patterson, a neighbour. Tufford on the other hand
testified that he sold the 6,000 shares to the plaintiffs at $1 per share and
that the money was raised and paid as the purchase price. During the following
year there was considerable correspondence between the plaintiffs and Tufford,
and the plaintiffs acquired some additional stock.

The mine did not realize the hopes or expectations of its
promoters and shareholders; it was unproductive, and this action was instituted
and brought to trial against the three defendants upon various counts,
including one for the recovery of the sum of $6,000 as money lent.

At the close of the trial, the learned judge expressed the view
that the $6,000 was a loan, and that the plaintiffs should succeed upon that
issue, but he suggested a question as to whether the Delta Company, as
distinguished from the other defendants, was liable to repay it, because it had
received the money under the agency for sale agreement with Tufford Limited.
Some discussion upon this topic followed, and the case stood over for judgment.
Then, after consideration and further examination of the correspondence, the
learned judge, having disposed of the other issues, which do not now arise,
announced that he was of the same opinion as expressed when the evidence was
completed at the trial; he said that the $6,000 was undoubtedly a loan, and he
added:—

Tufford was bound to find $10,000, and pay it to The Delta
Company that day (15th May, 1917), under the terms of the agreement between

[Page 148]

Tufford, Limited, and the Delta
Company. He induces the plaintiffs— stampeded them—with a story of material
loss to the company in which 'they were shareholders, if the money was not
found. They get it on their credit and handed it over to him. He sends
it to Tufford, Limited, and that company in turn hands it to the
Delta Company. And as a further inducement, Tufford delivers to Moore to be
held by him in trust, 6,000 shares of the Delta Company stock as security, and
further he undertook to sell this security stock within three months to the
public, and at the same time the plaintiffs also were authorized to sell it.
These shares were to be sold at not less than one dollar, but eventually, as a
consideration in other transactions, these shares and all others that had been
sold at one dollar were reduced to fifty cents by doubling the number of
shares. Neither Tufford nor the plaintiffs have sold these shares. They are
still held by Moore as security for the loan. And certainly this sum remains a
loan until paid or until plaintiffs expressly agree that its character be
changed. I have examined all the correspondence, and I find no clear voluntary
consent on plaintiff's part to accept this stock, now held as a security, in payment
of the loan. There is much confusion in the letters of all parties but not
sufficient for me to believe that any of these men intended at any time to
release their claim for a return of this money, or that Tufford ever thought
they had.

On appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta that court allowed the appeal and dismissed the action, but the learned
judges gave no reasons which are reported in the case, although we are informed
that Beck J. dissented from the judgment of the majority.

At the argument I was impressed with the view that no sufficient
or satisfactory reason had been shown for disturbing the finding of the trial
judge upon the issue of loan or purchase, and now, after carefully reading the
evidence and exhibits in proof, I am confirmed in that opinion. It is not the
view of the learned judges of the Appellate Division upon the merits involved
in the issue of fact which should govern the disposition of the case. It was
for the Appellate Division to ascertain whether there is evidence upon which
the trial judge could find as he did find; and, if there be evidence of the
facts found to which he could reasonably give effect, having due regard to the
weight of evidence, it was for the court to consider further whether his
finding is based upon any misdirection, occasioning a substantial miscarriage
of justice, or the judgment, in the light of the evidence, and having regard to
the course of the trial, discloses any error of law. If there be no error in
these particulars the judgment should be permitted to stand. It is by s. 51 of
the Supreme Court Act the duty of this court to give the judgment which the
court below should have given; and, in the endeavour to discharge this duty, I
am

[Page 149]

satisfied that there is evidence
reasonably to justify the finding that the money was advanced by way of loan
upon the security of the stock, and not as payment for stock purchased. This
was clearly the intention of the transaction according to the testimony of the
defendants, Murray and Moore, and there are moreover passages in the subsequent
correspondence which are inconsistent with the view that the parties intended
to become purchasers of the stock. It is urged that there are to be found in
the circumstances of the case, and in other places in the correspondence,
considerations or statements which are compatible only wish an intention to
purchase the shares; but I think the appellants failed to establish this, and I
do not find in the circumstances, or in the evidence upon which the appellants
rely, anything which demonstrates error in the trial judge's finding of fact.

There is a minor point, involving the liability of the borrower
for $1,000, part of the loan, which it is said the learned trial judge
overlooked. It appears that his attention was not directed to this point; but,
upon examination of the facts, I do not think they justify any reduction of the
amount found. By the agreement of 15th May, Tufford agreed to sell 1,000 shares
within thirty days. On 2nd June following, he wrote Moore and his associates
explaining that, by reason of a deal which he had completed in Toronto, he
could not raise the $1,000 before 15th June, and he added

that means default on my part unless
you get busy and either sell or buy the thousand shares.

Moore, in his reply of 10th June, said:—

We have decided to take care of the thousand shares
mentioned in your letter.

It is urged that this correspondence
should be interpreted to mean that, as to the thousand shares, part of the
6,000, the plaintiffs had become the purchasers, and that therefore, to that
extent, the loan was satisfied. I think it very doubtful however that the
plaintiffs in stating that they had decided to take care of the thousand shares
intended to purchase them, or to take them in part payment of the money lent. I
think it probable that they intended no more than to intimate that in the
circumstances they would not insist upon Tufford making the sale of these
shares within the thirty days stipulated by the agreement, and it

[Page 150]

is to be observed that by a later
agreement of 3rd September, 1917, between Tufford and the plaintiffs, which is
signed by all of them, it was agreed that Tufford

with the assistance of one, or more,
if required) (of the plaintiffs), shall forthwith, upon demand of the latter in
writing, sell all or any part of the 6,000 shares at $1 per share.

It was anticipated of course, according
to the plaintiffs' case, that the loan would be repaid by the proceeds of the
sale of the shares, and, if in the interval 1,000 of these had been purchased
by the plaintiffs, it is remarkable that in the later agreement they should
have adhered to the project of selling the whole of the 6,000 shares which
still stood in the name of the defendant, Moore, in trust.

Then it is said that inasmuch as the agreement of 15th May, 1917,
provided that the defendant, Tufford, should deposit 6,000 shares of his own
stock with the plaintiff Moore as trustee, to be forfeited if Tufford failed to
carry out his agreement, and inasmuch as those 5,000 shares were deposited and
forfeited, the plaintiffs, receiving the benefit of the forfeiture, could not
thereafter insist upon payment of the loan, because of the rule that, where a
penalty is provided for non-performance of a contract, the penalty if recovered
shall be taken as a satisfaction of the contractual liability to secure which
the penalty is stipulated. Harrison v. Wright[1].
It must be observed, however, that the agreement Which stipulated for the
deposit and forfeiture of Tufford's 5,000 shares did not expressly provide for
the loan or for the repayment of it. The agreement to lend the $6,000 upon the
security of an equivalent amount of the Delta Company's shares was an oral
agreement, concluded between the plaintiffs and Tufford, and the purpose of the
written agreement was merely to bind the defendant, Tufford, to realize by sale
of these shares within the times limited, so as to provide for payment of the
loan; and, to ensure that he would do this, or, as the agreement states,
""to prove his good faith,"" he deposited his own 5,000 shares. The
agreement of 15th May, and the forfeiture of the 5,000 shares of Tufford's
stock, are concerned with the security for the loan, not with the loan itself.
The validity of the forfeiture is not in question. It would seem that Tufford
acknowledged the forfeiture and surrendered his interest; but there is no
proof, except the agreement itself,

[Page 151]

that the forfeiture was intended to
satisfy the loan; and, for the reasons which I have mentioned, I do not
consider that the agreement bears that interpretation.

Finally, it is urged on behalf of the respondents that, if the
$6,000 paid by the appellants to Tufford was money lent, the loan was to C. R.
Tufford personally and that neither of the defendant companies is liable for
it. This defence was not raised by the pleadings, nor does it appear to have
been suggested at the trial as affecting the liability of C. R. Tufford,
Limited, although the learned trial judge did, in the discussion at the close
of the trial to which I have alluded, suggest doubt as to the liability of the
Delta Company; but he does not refer to the question in the reasons for
judgment which he subsequently delivered. C. R. Tufford, Limited, is said to
have consisted of C. R. Tufford, his wife, mother and stenographer; he was the
president of the company, and no doubt was acting as its agent in his efforts
to dispose of the stock of the Delta Company, and to maintain the agreement
under which the Tufford Company had authority to sell the stock. It was the
latter company to which he reported and to which, under his instructions, the
$6,000 paid by the plaintiff were remitted, and I am not disposed to disturb
the finding involved in the judgment of the learned trial judge that Tufford,
in his transaction with the plaintiffs, was acting with the authority and on
behalf of C. R. Tufford, Limited. Tufford borrowed the money, but as between
him, or the Tufford Company, and the Delta Company the transaction was treated
as a purchase of the 6,000 shares by the plaintiffs; Tufford agreed to sell
them, and it was anticipated that they would realize enough to pay the loan,
but the transaction is not capable of an interpretation which would exclude
personal liability of Tufford to repay the money borrowed. If, as I assume, he
acted as agent of the Tufford Company, he nevertheless pledged his individual
credit for the repayment of the loan.

Now the judgment at the trial proceeds upon the view that all
three defendants are jointly and severally liable. The judgment is that the

plaintiffs do recover judgment
against the defendants and each of them for the sum of $6,000, etc.

But the liability of the defendants, the
Delta Copper Company, Limited, and C. R. Tufford, Limited, depends upon

[Page 152]

the agency of Tufford and upon the
assumption that the loan was contracted on their behalf, Tufford undertaking at
the same time personal responsibility for repayment. I find it difficult to
justify a judgment holding the parties jointly and severally liable. The ordinary
rule is that the principal and agent may be liable to the other contracting
party in the alternative, which alternative liability continues until the
election of the latter to accept one, either the principal or the agent, as his
debtor. In Priestly v. Fernie[2], where
the master of a ship had signed a bill of lading in his own name and was sued
upon it to judgment, it was held that an action did not lie against the owner
of the ship for the same cause, although satisfaction had not been obtained
against the master, and Bramwell B., pronouncing the judgment of the Court of
Exchequer, said:

If this were an ordinary case of principal and agent, where
the agent having made the contract in his own name, has been sued on it to
judgment, there can be no doubt that no second action would be maintainable
against the principal. The very expression that where a contract is so made the
contractee has an election to sue agent or principal, supposes he can only sue
one of them, that is to say, sue to judgment.

This case was cited with approval by Lord
Cairns in Kendall v. Hamilton[3], and
followed by the Court of Appeal in Ireland in Sullivan v. Sullivan[4].

As to the Delta Company however there are additional and
different considerations. That company was in possession of the mine under
option to purchase. There was first an agreement of 24th June, 1916, between
Bernard Halloran and Robt. W. Thomson, of the first part, and Byron R. Jones,
of the second part, whereby the parties of the first part gave to the party of
the second part the sole and exclusive right and option to purchase, for
$50,000, certain mineral claims which comprise the mine in question, payable in
instalments of varying amounts half yearly, the last payment to be made on or
before 15th November, 1918, the party of the first part having immediate
possession of the areas and the right to develop and to mine them. Then there
is an agreement of 12th May, 1917, between Bernard Halloran and Robt. W.
Thomson of the first part and the Delta Copper Company of the second part,
which recites that the parties of the first part are the owners of

[Page 153]

the Delta group of mineral claims; that
by the agreement of 24th June, 1916, they granted to Byron R. Jones an option
to purchase them, and that Jones had granted a further option to Robt. Spencer,
who had assigned his option to the Delta Copper Company; this agreement
provided for the reduction of the payments under the Jones option which were to
mature. The agreement between Jones and Spencer and the assignment by Spencer
to the Delta Company are not in evidence, but I infer that the Delta Company
acquired a mere option and undertook no obligation for payment of the
stipulated price. Now there is no evidence that the Delta Company gave to
either of the other defendants any authority to borrow money on its account.
The agreement between the Delta Company and C. R. Tufford, Limited, is in
proof, and it confers no authority except for the sale of shares. There is no
evidence that the Delta Company was informed of the facts with regard to the
$6,000 transaction between the plaintiffs and Tufford, or had any knowledge or
reason to suspect that the amount which the latter remitted was a loan. On 14th
May, 1917, C. R. Tufford had telegraphed his firm at Edmonton from Caledonia as
follows:—

Standard Bank here wired two thousand our credit Standard
Bank, Edmonton, to-day. Turn to (Delta) company immediately.

This refers to a payment of $2,000 which
Tufford had obtained from the plaintiffs on the date last mentioned. In the
meantime he was endeavouring to arrange for $6,000 additional, and, on the same
day, he telegraphed his firm at Edmonton, saying:—

Watch Standard Bank, Edmonton, to-morrow for more money
wired through to-morrow, but do not be disappointed if none comes, and do not
depend on it.

Then on 15th May, he telegraphed again to
his firm, in these words:—

Have company allot and issue to Thomas G. Moore, box
forty-four Caledonia, Ontario, out of this issue, eight thousand shares; money
wired Standard Bank, Edmonton, covering same yesterday and to-day. Draw full
commission under contract thirty per cent before delivering money, then buy two
thousand shares our name, and again draw full commission. Complete to-day,
sure.

These 8,000 shares include the 6,000
shares, which, upon the finding in the case, were to be deposited as security
for the plaintiffs' loan, and, in addition, 2,000 shares, which were to be
issued in the transaction referred to in Tufford's first telegram of 14th May.
The telegrams, it will be per-

[Page 154]

ceived, convey no information or reason
for conjecture, that the $8,000 represented anything but proceeds of the sale
of shares, or that the 8,000 shares, or any part of them, were to be issued as
security for a loan. On the contrary, Tufford, by his telegram of 15th May,
directed that the Tufford Company's commission as selling agent should be
withheld, and the taking of commission involved a direct representation of
sale. No doubt the money was received by the company, and it may have been used
to make up the payment to Halloran and Thomson, which, by the terms of the
Delta Company's option, was to be paid on 15th May; but, if so, while in one
sense the Delta Company had the benefit of the payment, the money did not go to
discharge any obligation of the latter company. It was evidently the policy of
the Delta Company that the mine, which was of course speculative property,
should pay for itself; the optional payments and cost of development being
provided for by money received from the sale of the shares. The plaintiffs now
contend that, even if there be no evidence upon which it can be found that the
Delta Company authorized the borrowing, nevertheless it is liable to repay them
as recipient of the benefit, but I do not think this contention can be maintained.

The Delta Company received the money in circumstances which
justified it to conclude, and no doubt it dealt with the money upon the
assumption, that it was received as proceeds of the sale of its shares. The
plaintiffs knew the defendant, Tufford, not otherwise than as agent for sale of
the Delta Company's stock, and that agency was certainly not suggestive of any
authority in Tufford to borrow money upon the company's credit. If therefore
they paid the money to Tufford as a loan to the company, he must be regarded as
their agent for the purpose of making the loan, and not as the company's agent
to receive it; and, seeing that Tufford caused the money to be paid to the
company as proceeds of the sale of the 6,000 shares of stock, which the
company, under his instruction, allotted to the plaintiff, Moore, in trust, the
plaintiffs have no recourse against the company for the recovery of the money,
or by reason of the application of it to the company's purposes. I hold
therefore that the plaintiffs cannot recover the $6,000 from the Delta Company
upon the allegation of the statement of claim as money lent, or by reason of

[Page 155]

any benefit which it enjoys through the
use or application of the money which it received.

Therefore, as against the Delta Company, the appeal should be
dismissed with costs, but as to the other defendants the appellants may elect
to have judgment against one of them with costs throughout.

Appeal allowed in part.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Reserved case—Insufficiency of
the stated case—Authority to order copy of evidence—Arts. 1017, 1024 Cr.C .

By virtue of the combined effect of sections
1017  and 1024  of the Criminal Code , the Supreme Court of Canada, when it deems
it necessary, may require the trial judge to supplement the material submitted
by him as a reserved case stated pursuant to an order of the court of appeal,
by furnishing a copy of such parts of the evidence at the trial as are material
to the disposition of the questions directed to be submitted.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the
appellant and dismissing the application made by him for a new trial on a
stated case.

Laflamme K.C. and Bazin K.C. for the
appellant.

Bertrand and Fontaine for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice (for the court).—The accused was convicted on
the 2nd December, 1922, of an offence under s. 477  of the Criminal Code  by the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace of the District of St. Hyacinthe; and the
judge of that court having dismissed the application of the accused to have
questions of law reserved for the consideration of the Court of King's Bench,
an order was made by that court giving leave to appeal and directing the judge

to state a case for the consideration of this
court; and to reserve for the decisions of this court the following questions
of law:

1. Did the indictment upon which the accused
was arraigned, tried and convicted in this case disclose the commission of a
criminal offence?

2. Was the said promissory note a false
document as described by the code, article 335?

3. Was the said promissory note a forged
document, as required by article 466 of the code?

4. Was the said promissory note a document
such as described by article 477  of the Criminal Code ?

5. Is there entire absence of proof of any
intention to defraud on the part of the accused when signing and uttering the
said document?

6. Was the evidence made by the Crown
relating to the said note of $3,500 dated 2nd June, 1921, payable to Dame Euphémie
Gauthier Reeves, to the promissory note of $1,500 dated 2nd November, 1921,
payable

[Page 729]

to H. Ernest Benoit, to the promissory note
of $4,000 dated 12th November, 1921, payable to Alexander Choinière and to the
note of $2,500 payable to one Pothier admissible in evidence? and that the said
stated case be in due course transmitted to the clerk of the court with the
record.

A document was accordingly forwarded by the
judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to the Court of King's Bench,
which was treated by the latter court as being a stated case within the meaning
of this order. Apparently the notes taken by the judge at the trial, if any,
were not sent to the Court of King's Bench, nor was that court furnished with a
shorthand note of the evidence.

In the opinion of the majority of the court the
facts stated in the case as framed by the learned trial judge are not of such a
character as to make it possible to answer question 5 in the negative, and in
the absence of a complete statement of the material evidence it is obviously
impossible to answer it in the affirmative. In respect of this question there
was a dissenting judgment in the Court of King's Bench.

The order of the Court of King's Bench seems to
have contemplated a stated case which should in itself contain a full account
of the evidence given material to that question or that the Court of King's
Bench should be put in possession of a note of the evidence taken at the trial.
In these circumstances, in order that this court may be in possession of the
information necessary to enable it to give an affirmative or a negative answer
to the question, the proper course seems to be to direct that the judge of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace furnish to this court a copy of such parts
of the evidence given at the trial as may be material.

By the combined effect of subsections 1017 and
1024 of the Criminal Code  this court seems to have authority to make such an
order.",1923-10-22 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeal—Bail—Jurisdiction—Section
1019 Cr. C.

A judge of the Supreme Court
of Canada has no jurisdiction to admit to bail an accused person pending his
appeal to this court, such jurisdiction being conferred by section 1019 (1)  of
the Criminal Code  upon the Chief Justice of the appellate court or a judge of
that court designated by him.

APPLICATION on behalf of the
appellant for an order that he be admitted to bail pending his appeal to this
court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.

The appellant was convicted on
October 16, 1923, on a charge of having had carnal knowledge of a girl under
sixteen, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year. Appeal was taken from the
sentence to the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia, and the same was dismissed on
November 22, 1923, but one judge of the Court of Appeal dissented.
Under section 1024 of the Criminal Code , the appellant then appealed to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

The appellant was admitted to
bail pending the hearing before the court of first instance, and also pending
his appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia; but, upon application
to the Court of Appeal to admit him to bail pending the determination of his
appeal to this court, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal held that that
court had no jurisdiction, presumably considering that, in-

[Page 2]

asmuch as an appeal had been
taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal was functus
officio. Hence the application to this court.

Section 1019 (1)  of the Criminal
Code , as enacted by section 9  of 13-14 George V, c. 41, reads as follows:—

1019 (1). The Chief Justice
or the Acting Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, or a judge of that court to
be designated by him, may, if it seems fit, on the application of an appellant,
admit the appellant to bail pending the determination of his appeal.

Smellie K.C. for the
appellant.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—On this
application coming before me in chambers I could not find in the Criminal Code 
jurisdiction given me to make the order asked for. After consultation with such
of my brother judges as were available, forming with myself a majority of the
court, we have come to the conclusion that this court has no jurisdiction to
make the order but that section 1019 (1)  of the Criminal Code  confers
jurisdiction upon the Chief Justice or the acting Chief Justice of the
Provincial Court of Appeal, or upon a judge of that court to be designated by
him, to admit the appellant to bail pending the determination of his appeal. The
latter words of the section ""the determination of his appeal"" must be
construed as extending to the continuance of his appeal from the provincial
Court of Appeal to this court and that therefore the jurisdiction to admit the
appellant to bail pending the appeal here rests with the judge specially named
in that section.

Application is refused.",1923-12-15 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Warrant
against accused in United States as
undesirable—Admissions before, emigration officers— Admissibility
of evidence—Voluntary statement.

A warrant of arrest having been issued
against the appellant on a charge of murder committed in a lumber camp near
Quebec, his presence in the City of Detroit was discovered a year later by a
Canadian detective. Instead of instituting extradition proceedings, the detective
obtained the arrest of the appellant under a warrant of deportation, as an
undesirable, issued by the U. S. Imigration authorities. On being brought
before two emigration officers and informed that he would be deported, the
appellant declared that he was ""as good as dead"". The officers asked:
""Why?""; and the appellant then answered by making certain admissions
as to his presence at the lumber camp at the time of the murder. At the trial,
the two officers gave evidence as to these statements by the accused.

Held that the
evidence was admissible, as the statements made by the accused were
""voluntary"" within the rule laid down in the case of Ibrahim v
The King ([1914] A.C. 599), Mignault J dubitante.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec,
upholding the conviction of the appellant and dismissing the application made
by him for a new trial on a stated case.

[Page 227]

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.

Lucien Cannon K.C. for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from the Court of King's
Bench of the Province of Quebec,
which by a majority upheld the conviction of the appellant Prosko, or ""Big
Mike"" as he was generally called, on the charge of the murder of a man in
one of the lumber camps of Quebec. Prosko had been tried jointly with another man named Janousky
before Chief Justice Sir François Lemieux and a jury. Both were found guilty by
the jury; but on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, the conviction against
Janousky was unanimously quashed and a new trial granted to him, while the
conviction against the appellant Prosko was by a majority of that court upheld,
the Chief Justice Lamothe and Greenshields J. dissenting.

The reasons of the court for quashing the
conviction against Janousky substantially were that certain statements,
admissions or confessions made to the police officers of the city of Detroit by
Prosko when he was in custody there, as to his own and Janousky's connection
with the. murder for which they were being jointly tried were inadmissible as
against Janousky, and calculated to prejudice his receiving a fair and
impartial trial, and this notwithstanding that the trial judge in charging the
jury had fully and explicitly

[Page 228]

told them they were not to consider or give any
weight to these alleged admissions or statements or confessions, as they were
called, of Prosko as against his co-prisoner Janousky.

The court was unanimous on this point of
granting a new trial to Janousky but a majority, as I have stated, held, and in
my opinion, properly that these statements, admissions or confessions of Prosko
were admissible against himself in the circumstances and under the conditions
in which they were made, and that they would not interfere, in Prosko's case,
with the judicial discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant
the application of counsel for a separate trial of each of the prisoners.

The questions reserved for the consideration of
the Court of King's Bench were as follows:—

(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial to the accused?

(2) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the two witnesses
Heig and Mitte, as to certain statements or so-called admissions made by one of
the accused, Prosko?

(a) as to
the accused Prosko?

(b) as to
the other accused Janousky?

(c) seeing the admissions made by Prosko
were so made in the absence of Janousky, were the instructions of the trial
judge to the jury that statements made by one of the prisoners did not make
evidence against the other, sufficient?

(3) Was there error in admitting the testimony of the witness Roussin
with respect to certain statements made by Prosko either before or after his
arrest?

(4) Was there error in permitting the Crown to produce before and
exhibit to the jury as exhibits certain objects which were found in the
possession of one or other of the accused on or in the premises occupied by one
or other of them?

So far as Janousky is concerned, the questions
are finally disposed of and we need not concern ourselves with them. As to the
other accused, Prosko, question (3) was abandoned at the hearing before us,
leaving the three questions to be considered by us on this appeal:—

[Page 229]

(1) the refusal of a separate trial to him;

(2) the admission in evidence of the statements or confessions sworn to
by Heig and Mitte as having been made to them by Prosko; and

(3) the production as exhibits of clothing and other articles such as a
mask, a false moustache and an electric torch, said to have been found in a
valise or parcel in Prosko's room in his boarding house in Montreal. With regard to the first of these
questions, I have no difficulty in declining to interfere with the judicial
discretion exercised by the trial judge in refusing to grant the application
for such separate trial for Prosko. It is true the appücation was made twice;
once, when the trial began and, afterwards, when it was proposed to put in Heig
and Mitte's evidence respecting Prosko's statements or confessions (so-called)
to them. But I am quite unable to find any possible prejudice which could arise
to Prosko from this refusal. There might be and in fact the Court of King's
Bench held it to be quite possible that a joint trial coupled with the
admission of such evidence, notwithstanding the judge's charge to the jury that
they were not to consider or give any weight to these alleged admissions or
statements of Prosko as against his co-prisoner, might prejudice Janousky, and
that it was impossible to say what effect they might have had on the minds of
the jurymen. But as regards Prosko, admitting for the moment the admissibility
of such evidence, I cannot find any possible prejudice which its admission
would cause to him.

Then as to the admissibility of this evidence as
against Prosko, I think the statement of Lord Sumner, when delivering the
reasons for the conclusions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in
the case of Ibrahim v. The King[1]
correctly states the rule in that regard:

[Page 230]

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary
statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear
of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

See also The King v Colpus[2]; The King v. Voisin[3];Rex v. Cook[4].

I have read the evidence of each of these
witnesses Heig and Mitte most carefully. I concede that they were persons in
authority having at the time Prosko in their custody with the intention of
bringing him before the United States Immigration Board to be examined whether
or not he was an undesirable immigrant to the United
 States, and with a view to his deportation being
ordered if he was found undesirable.

I fail to find the slightest evidence that
Prosko's statements or confessions were induced or obtained from him either

by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercized or held out

by either Mitte or Heig to him. On the contrary
I conclude that Prosko's statements were absolutely voluntary ones. After
having been told by these witnesses in Detroit that they were going to take up
his case with the United States Immigration officials and have him deported to
Canada, Prosko replied:— ""I am as good as dead if you send me over
there."" The officers in reply to this naturally asked ""Why""?
Whereupon Prosko proceeded to give his statement as given in evidence by these
two witnesses. (It must be remembered that the time when he made these
statements or confessions was before he was brought before the Immigration
Board, and that later, when he

[Page 231]

was brought before that Board he repeated under
oath, as Heig and Mitte say in evidence, the statement he had already made to
them. The Immigration Board on hearing his statement or confession made the
necessary order for his deportation). Under these circumstances I feel bound to
answer the second question in the negative.

As regards the third question to be considered
by us on this appeal, I feel bound to say that I cannot see any reason why the
crown, having by its officer, Roussin, visited the boarding house in Montreal
of Prosko, and having there been shown the rooms said to have been occupied by
Prosko and one Yvasko, should not have produced the articles found there and
put them in as exhibits. If the crown produced any of these articles found in
this room of Prosko's it was bound, in my opinion, to produce all articles
found there.

I do not attach any great importance to the
production of these articles. They consisted in part of an electric flashlight,
a false moustache, several photos of Prosko, a cap and other articles.

The question of their being improperly admitted
as exhibits was not strongly pressed at bar, and even if they were improperly
given in evidence as exhibits, which I do not at all concede, I cannot think it
possible that ""any substantial wrong or miscarriage"" was thereby
occasioned on the trial as regards Prosko.

Unless there was in our opinion such substantial
wrong or miscarriage occasioned, we are forbidden by sec. 1019  of the Criminal
Code  to set aside the conviction or direct a new trial.

Under all these circumstances and on my findings
with respect to the questions submitted to us, I am of the opinion that the
appeal must be dismissed.

[Page 232]

Idington J.—Four men entered, during the night of the 27th July, 1918, a
lumber camp in the Province of Quebec, for the purpose of robbing the men
therein, and, in the course of such pursuit, shot and killed one of the men
there.

Two of the said four were convicted of the
murder and were executed in July, 1920.

Thereafter the appellant and another named
Janousky were placed on trial in Quebec. In their defence they were represented by the same counsel who
asked the court to direct that they be tried separately, but this privilege was
denied them.

The trial resulted in the conviction of both.
Thereupon a stated case was directed by the Court of King's Bench and, upon the
hearing thereof, a new trial was granted Janousky but, by a majority of the
court, denied the appellant.

The learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Green-shields dissented from the said denial of a new trial to the appellant.
Hence this appeal here based on some of the grounds taken in such dissent.

The first question so raised is as follows:

(1) Was there error in refusing a separate trial
to the accused.?

The Court of King's Bench having unanimoulsy
arrived at the conclusion that as to Janousky there was error, we have nothing
to say as to that aspect of the case except to make clear the reason for so
distinguishing.

There were many statements made by appellant
which the trial court admitted in evidence against him, and in some of these he
had referred to Janousky, under his nickname of ""little George,"" in
such a way as to implicate him.

[Page 233]

There was a possibility of the jury having been
impressed thereby to the detriment of Janousky and, in that result, to have
confused that and somewhat similar incidents in other features of the case as
presented by the entire evidence, nothwithstanding the clear and express
direction of the learned trial judge to the jury to apply the evidence in such
a way as to avoid such possible error.

There was no such counterpart in the evidence
against Janousky alone as would tend to the confusion thereof with the case
made against the appellant alone.

In the broad salient features of the case
demonstrating the actual perpetration of the crime there was nothing to
confuse. It is merely when the evidence of the identification of the accused,
or either of them, came to be considered by the jury that there was a
possibility of undesirable confusion of thought.

Whatever may have been possible in that regard
relevant to Janousky, and to his detriment, I cannot see how appellant was
likely to have suffered the like from anything in the evidence directed to
Janousky's part, if any, in the matter in question.

Counsel for appellant, indeed did not point to
anything specific in that regard but seemed to rest upon and press the
possibility of appellant having been able to call Janousky as a witness on his
behalf if a separate trial had been granted.

There is nothing specific in way of fact
presented to support this contention.

Nor, so far as I can see, was such a pretension
presented to the learned trial judge.

I cannot see any good ground for the allowance
of this appeal by way of answering this question in the affirmative.

[Page 234]

The next question raised herein is as to the
admissibility of the evidence of Heig and Mitte who swear that appellant, after
having been presented with the decision of the authorities in Detroit that he
was to be deported back to Canada as an undesirable citizen, said ""I am as
good as dead"" which naturally evoked the question ""how is that""?
and he proceeded to to tell a story which, as I read its introduction, was not
improperly induced within the meaning of the rule in that regard as set forth
by Lord Sumner in the case cited to us, as follows:—

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English Criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale.

I refer to the case of Ibrahim v. The
King,[5]
at foot of page 609 and top of 610. The dictum from which I quote was
approved in the later case of The King v. Voisin[6].

As pointed out in argument the said case was
decided on other grounds and the ruling only an incident, but nevertheless,
this is a fair presentation of the rule invoked by the dissenting judges in the
Court of King's Bench.

It is the inducement exercised by the officers
in charge that is to be guarded against and not the accidental circumstances of
an arrest and the bearing thereof on the mind of one accused that has to be
guarded against.

And the evidence of each of these witnesses is
introduced by a distant categorical denial of having exercised any of these
practices which would bring the evidence given within the rule against its
admission.

[Page 235]

I think, therefore, the learned trial judge's
ruling was right and that the question raised anent same must be answered in
the negative.

Then as to Roussin's evidence the appellant was
distinctly warned by him upon his arrest that anything he said would be used
against him and hence no ground for the contention set up.

In truth it seems to have been assumed in
argument here as hopeless to argue, if held that the evidence of the American
detectives of statements made by accused, without express warning, was
admissible, then Roussin's story in what he tells, so far as it was
substantially the same as had been told by the said detectives, could not be
rejected.

I am decidedly of the opinion that both were
admissible.

The only other question upon which counsel for
appellant rested his appeal was the fourth question of the stated case, which
reads as follows:

Was there error in permitting the Crown to
produce before and exhibit to the jury as exhibirs certain objects which were
found in the possession of one or other of
the accused on or in the premises occupied by one or other of them?

I, with great respect, find it difficult to
treat such a question seriously. Some of the articles found were not worthy of
serious consideration by the jury, but the false moustache and flashlight, for
example, were important items well worthy of consideration in a case such as
this dependent to so great an extent as it was upon circumstantial evidence.

That which was incapable of being fitted into
the chain of circumstances to be relied upon, of course, would be discarded by
the jury to whom we must attribute common sense.

[Page 236]

It became the duty of the crown officer to
present the suit-case contents as found and let the jury determine what was
relevant and what was not. And then not leave the impression that accused was
so intent in pursuit of easy money that he could think of nothing else, and
hence carried only false moustaches, flashlights or glass cutters.

The question should be answered, as it was by
the majority of the court below, in the negative.

The appeal herein should be dismissed.

Anglin J.—The material facts are sufficiently stated in the judgments
delivered in the Court of King's Bench. Of the three questions argued before us
only one in my opinion called for consideration, viz., whether certain
statements alleged to have been made by the appellant to two American
detectives (Heig and Mitte) were admissible in evidence against him. To both
the other grounds of appeal s. 1019  Cr. G. appeared to me to afford a
sufficient answer. But, having regard to the importance attached to the
statements made to Heig and Mitte by the learned Chief Justice in charging the
jury, the question of their admissibility cannot be thus disposed of.

My only reason for withholding concurrence in
the judgment dismissing the appeal was that, owing to pressure of other work of
the court, I had not had an opportunity of satisfying myself by a study of the
record that the Crown had discharged the burden, which undoubtedly rested upon
it, of establishing that the statements made by the appellant to Heig and Mitte
were voluntary statements, in the sense that they had not been obtained from
him by fear of prejudice or

[Page 237]

hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person
in authority. Ibrahim v. The King[7]; The
Queen v. Thompson[8]; The
King v. Colpus[9]; The
King v. Voisin[10].

The two detectives were persons in authority;
the accused was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in
extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning
whatever was given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to
exclude the admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay[11], they are undoubtedly
circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to establish their
voluntary character should be closely scrutinized. Rex v. Rodney[12].

If I should have reached the conclusion that the
burden on the prosection of establishing the voluntary character of the alleged
admissions had not been discharged, the proper result would have been to order
not the discharge of the appellant (s. 1018 (d) Cr. C.), but his remand for a
new trial (s. 1018 (b) Cr. C.) Since the majority of the court was clearly of
the opinion that the impugned evidence was properly received and the appeal
therefore failed, I did not feel justified in delaying the judgment and
shortening the time available for consideration of the case by the Executive,
merely to complete my own study of the evidence, especially in view of the fact
that the case must in any event go before the Minister of Justice, who may, if
he should entertain any doubt of the propriety of the conviction, grant the
appellant the only relief to which he would in my opinion in any event have
been entitled. (S. 1022 Cr. C.)

[Page 238]

For these reasons, while not dissenting, I
refrained from concurring in the judgment affirming the conviction.

Since the delivery of judgment, however, I have
had an opportunity of considering the material evidence and I think I should
state that I now see no reason to differ from the conclusion reached by the
majority of the Court that the evidence in question was admissible. At all
events the discretion exercised by the learned trial judge in receiving it
could not properly have been interfered with. The King v. Voisin[13].

Brodeur J.—Trois questions nous sont soumises.

La premiére est de savoir si l'accusé Prosko
avait eu raison de demander un procès séparé de son co-accusé Janousky.

Le président du tribunal a refusé cette demande
et les deux accusés ont subi leur procès en même temps et ont été trouvés
coupables de meurtre.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a decidé que Janousky
avait eu raison de demander un procès séparé parce que des aveux faits par son
complice Prosko ont pu lui causer un tort réel et ont pu amener sa
condamna-tion. La Cour du Banc du Roi a été d'opinion que Prosko n'avait
souffert aucun préjudice d'avoir subi son procès en même temps que son
complice. Un nouveau procès séparé a donc été accordé à Janousky, mais a été
refusé à Prosko.

Ce dernier appelle de cette décision.

La preuve au procès a été en général commune aux
deux accusés. Ils ont été vus tous les deux près de la scéne du meurtre, avant
et après. On a trouvé à leurs résidences respectives des effete dont se servent

[Page 239]

d'ordinaire ceux qui font du vol leur principale
occupation. Dans le cas de Prosko, cette preuve de circonstances a été
fortifiée par des aveux qu'il a faits avant et après son arrestation pour
meurtre.

Il est bien évident que ces admissions de Prosko pouvaient lui nuire considérablement;
mais ces aveux pouvaient être prouvés, que Prosko eût été mis seul en
accusation ou qu'il l'eût été avee son complice. Alors un procès séparé ne lui
aurait pas été plus favorable sur ce point. Il y a bien les effets trouvés chez
Janousky dont la mention au procès de Prosko aurait pu lui porter préjudice.
Mais on en a trouvé des semblables chez lui. Alors il me semble que cette
preuve quant aux effets trouvés chez Janousky ne peut pas être considérée comme
ayant cause un tort réel à Prosko. L'article 1019 du code criminel couvre le
cas. Je dirais donc que le président du tribunal n'a pas fait d'erreur en
refusant d'accorder à Prosko un procès séparé.

La deuxième question qui nous est soumise porte
sur des aveux qui auraient été faits par Prosko aux témoins Heig et Mitte.

Le détective Roussin, qui avait été chargé de retrouver
les auteurs du meurtre, avait appris que Prosko pouvait être l'un des
meurtriers et, un an environ après que le crime eût été commis, il l'a retracé
à Détroit, dans les Etats-Unis. Il s'est alors abouché avec deux détectives de
cette dernière ville, Heig et Mitte, et ils ont décidé, pour éviter les frais
d'un procès en extradition, que Prosko serait amené devant les autorités de l’immigration,
qui, si elles trouvaient que Prosko n'était pas un citoyen désirable, pourraient
le déporter des Etats-Unis au Canada.

[Page 240]

On l'arrête pour violation des lois
d'immigration. On lui dit qu'il va être déporté au Canada, et alors il déclare
en présence de Heigh et Mitte qu'il ne veut pas retourner au Canada; et il ajoute:"" I am as good as
dead"". Les détectives lui demandent pourquoi, et alors il raconte qu'il
avait été dans un camp avec certains hommes qui avaient alors
commis un meurtre. Ces délarations ont été faites volontairement, sans aucune
menace et sans aucune sollicitation.

Les decisions récentes en Angleterre sont à
l'effet que des déclarations faites comme dans le cas actuel doivent être
reçues par les tribunaux. Ibrahim v. The King[14]; The King v.
Colpus,[15];
The King v. Voisin,[16].
Il est à remarquer que ces déclarations de Prosko ont été faites avant qu'il ne
fût arrêtè pour meurtre. Je suis d'opinion que la cour n'a pas fait d'erreur en
recevant les témoignages de Heig et Mitte.

La troisième question est de savoir si les
effets trouvés dans les chambres des deux accusés pouvaient être produits comme
exhibits dans la cause.

Ces effets ont été produits comme éléments
d'accusa-tion. Il est de régie, surtout dans le cas de meurtre, de produire
devant la cour les effets dont l'accusé aurait pu se servir pour commettre le
crime dont il est accusé. On peut aussi produire des articles qui peuvent
servir à l'identifier.

Il paraît certain dans cette cause que le vol a
été le mobile du crime. Alors je ne vois pas pour ma part d'objection à ce que
l'on produise devant la cour des articles qui sont généralement utilisés par
les voleurs et que l'on trouve en la possession des accusés. Il est

[Page 241]

possible que certains de ces articles n'ont pas
dû servir à la commission du crime. Mais cette circonstance
ne serait pas suffisante pour constituer dans le cas de Prosko un déni de
justice ou un tort grave. Je répondrai donc
négativement à cette troisième question.

En conséquence l'appel doit être renvoyé.

Mignault J.—The only question raised by this appeal which appeared to me at
the hearing to have any substance was whether the evidence of some statements
made by Prosko at Detroit to
the American detectives Heig and Mitte should have been allowed.

When these statements were made Prosko was under
arrest by virtue of a warrant issued by the United States Immigration
authorities, as an undesirable, which warrant was served on him by one Roussin,
a Canadian detective, who was seeking to bring him to trial in Canada on a
murder charge, and instead of instituting extradition proceedings, it was
considered better to have Prosko deported as an un-dersirable when he would of
course be arrested on the murder charge. Roussin brought Prosko before the
Immigration authorities in Detroit, and when informed by them that he would be deported, Prosko told
them that he was as good as dead. Heig and Mitte then questioned him and it was
under these circumstances that he made the statements which were given in
evidence.

I have serious doubts whether this evidence
should have been allowed. The American detectives were persons in authority and
Prosko's exclamation when told that he would be deported shows that he understood

[Page 242]

that his deportation was sought in order to have
him brought to trial in Canada on the charge of murder. He evidently made the
statements he did with the hope to escape deportation and his consequent arrest
for murder, and the American detectives were persons in authority. It is true
that he subsequently made similar admissions in Canada to Roussin, but the learned trial judge insisted in his charge on
the evidence of Heig and Mitte as corroborating that of Roussin which otherwise
the jury might have hesitated to accept as sufficient, so the introduction of
this evidence may have caused a substantial wrong to the appellant. A majority
of the court is, however, of the opinion, that the evidence of Heig and Mitte
was admissible, so that Prosko's appeal cannot succeed. Under these circumstances
I have not entered a formal dissent, but I cannot do otherwise than express my
serious doubts as to the admissibility of this evidence.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Speedy trial—Election—Requirement
by the Attorney-General—Jury trial—Panel box—66 jurors instead of 60—Sections 446,
777, 778, 825, s.s. 5, 826, 827, 873, 927, 1019 Cr. C.—Arts. 3438, 3455, 3459 R.S.Q.

The appellant was arrested on a charge of
highway robbery, and, when brought before a judge of the Sessions of the Peace,
he did not elect for a speedy trial, pleaded ""not guilty"" and was
duly committed for trial. The Grand Jury found a true bill upon an indictment
preferred by the Attorney-General. The appellant was then arraigned and again
pleaded ""not guilty."" On the day of the trial his counsel made an
application to have the case postponed to the next term of the assizes to
permit the accused to elect for a speedy trial, if he so decided, but the
application was refused. Under article 3438 R.S.Q., sixty petit jurors had been
summoned; but the sheriff, on receiving notices of claims for exemption,
summoned additional jurors and returned before the court the first panel with
the additions made to it. As the claims for exemption were disallowed, the
names of sixty-six petit jurors remained in the panel box. On the day of the
trial, six jurors were absent; none of the jurors called were challenged by the
accused and the twelve called were sworn without any objection, except that
counsel for appellant objected to the fact that the panel box contained more
than the names of sixty jurors. This objection was also overruled, and the
appellant was tried and found guilty. A reserve case was granted the appellant;
and the questions submitted were as to the constitution of the panel and as to
whether the accused had wrongly been refused the right to elect for a speedy
trial.

Held, that the
alleged irregularities are not sufficient to entitle the accused to a new
trial.

Per Idington
J.—The appellant, having previously renounced any desire for a speedy trial and
having later pleaded to the indictment without raising any objection, had
waived any right he had to elect for a speedy trial.

[Page 155]

Per Duff and
Brodeur JJ.—The right of the appellant to elect to be tried summarily had been
taken away by the requirement by the Attorney-General for a jury trial, the
preferment of the indictment by the Attorney-General under sect. 873 Cr. C.,
constituting such requirement within the meaning of sect. 825, s.s. 5, as
enacted by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9, s. 2.

Per Anglin and
Mignault JJ.—The application made on behalf of the accused for a postponement
of the trial to permit him to re-elect was not an election for a speedy trial;
and, therefore, there was no refusal to grant acte of an option made by
the accused.

Held, also,
that, in not discharging the six additional jurors, the trial judge exercised a
discretion conferred on him by art. 3459 R.S.Q., and moreover, the appellant,
under the circumstances, did not suffer any substantial wrong on that account.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant
relating to questions of law arising on his trial and upon a stated case.

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. for the appellant.

Aimé Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C.
for the respondent.

Idington J.—The accused having when charged before the magistrate expressly
renounced any desire for speedy trial without jury and later notwithstanding
pleaded to the indictment without raising any sort of objection thereto, in my
opinion, had waived any legal right he had up to that time to elect for a
speedy trial.

Such was the settled state of the law until the
decision of this court in the case of Giroux v. The King[1].

[Page 156]

I am not quite sure in light of that decision,
what the law so laid down really is, but when applied to this case which is, as
it were, the counterpart of that, I think it has no application.

If that decision should, necessarily, govern in
regard to the point I raise, I would bow to it, though I dissented therein, but
it does not, I think, and therefore I hold the pleading to the indictment,
under the attendant circumstances, fatal to the appellant's contention herein.

There the accused was allowed, even after plea
to an indictment, to withdraw his plea and elect to go to trial before a judge
without a jury.

I thought then there was no jurisdiction in the
courts to so proceed.

This case is quite distinguishable from the case
of Minguy v. The King[2],
where the accused had indicated his desire to elect, as he was entitled to have
done, for a trial without a jury before he was forced to plead to an indictment
and thereby, as I held, improperly deprived of his right to elect.

I am, notwithstanding the doctrine laid down in
the case of Giroux v. The King[3],
unable to see that it necessarily governs this case.

I therefore would answer the first question of
the stated case in the negative.

And as to the second question I am of the
opinion that, under all the attendant circumstances, the error if any, which is
disputed, would not necessarily be fatal to the validity of the trial, and
therefore answer it also in the negative.

The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be
dismissed.

[Page 157]

Duff J.—The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

1st. As to the constitution of the panel. In
this respect no substantial prejudice was suffered by the accused. It is
unnecessary to repeat the observations contained in the case as stated and
signed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court and in the judgment of Mr.
Justice Martin with which I concur.

2nd. As to the right of the accused to elect to
be tried by a judge. Admittedly the accused had that right under sections 826 
and 827  of the Criminal Code  unless by virtue of a requirement by the Attorney-General
under s.s. 5 of sec. 825  Cr. C., that right was taken away. In Minguy v.
The King[4]
I concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice of this court that where the
Attorney-General prefers a bill of indictment under sec. 873  or where the bill
of indictment is, by the special direction of the Attorney-General, so
preferred that in itself constitutes a requirement that the case should be
tried by a jury within the meaning of section 825 , s.s. 5.

I am not at all impressed by the argument that
the power given by section 873 is a different power from that given by s.s. 5
of sec. 825. They are not the same power, no doubt; but it does not follow that
each must be exercised by an independent proceeding. A proceeding under sec.
873 may and prima facie does import a determination that the accused
shall be tried by jury, a determination negativing his right to be tried
without a jury and at all events, in the absence of some qualifying declaration
it is an exercise of the authority given by sec. 825, s.s. 5. I may add that
the decision in Giroux v. The King[5]
(a case in which the judges who took part in it proceeded upon diverse grounds)
is not an authority having any relevancy to this question.

[Page 158]

I think that in this case there is sufficient
evidence and there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge that the
Attorney-General had required that the case should be tried by a jury within
sec. 825, s.s. 5.

It is important, I think, to add that had it not
been for s.s. 5 of sec. 825  of the Criminal Code , I should have been
constrained to hold that in the language of sec. 1019 Cr. C., ""something
not according to law was done at the trial"" and consequently that the
conviction must be set aside. The accused, as I have already said, was
entitled, in the absence of action by the Attorney-General under sec. 825 , to
have the benefit of the procedure provided by sections 826  and 827 . Through no
fault of his own but through the default of the officers of the Crown he was
put upon his trial without being given the opportunity to take advantage of
those provisions; and had it not been for the intervention of the
Attorney-General he could not, I think, have been tried legally in these
circumstances.

It is not so much a question of jurisdiction.
The Court of King's Bench had jurisdiction to decide whether or not the accused
could legally be tried as it had jurisdiction to decide all other questions of
procedure and substantive law touching the liability of the accused to be tried
and convicted of the offence with which he was charged. The point is that the
trial of the prisoner in such circumstances would not have been a trial
according to law; an objection which could properly be raised by way of stated
case and dealt with on appeal under the provisions of the code.

For the reasons given I am of opinion, however,
that these last-mentioned considerations are without application in the present
case.

[Page 159]

Anglin J.—Two questions are
submitted by the reserved case granted the appellant:

1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte of
the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before a judge of the
Sessions without the intervention of a jury?

2. If it was the fact, that cards to the number
of 66, bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were placed
in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an irregularity or
illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief sought?

One of the learned judges of the Court of King's
Bench dissented from the majority of the court on both points.

(1) Although the argument travelled over the
whole field of the rights of a person committed for trial to elect for a speedy
trial—the duties of the sheriff and the judge, under secs. 826-7, to accord him
an opportunity to make such an election being specially dwelt upon as
imperative and as such affording a basis for the contention that because those
sections had not been complied with, the Court of King's Bench lacked
jurisdiction to try the appellant—the first of the two questions actually
presented for decision lies in a very much narrower compass. The only thing
approaching ""an option made by the accused for a speedy trial"" of
which the record contains any evidence is to be found in the following extract
from the procedure book of the Court of King's Bench:

Avant de procéder à tirer au sort les
cartes contenant les noms et les numéros des Petits Jurés, Mtre Alleyn
Taschereau, procureur de l'accusé, demande la remise de la cause aux prochaines
assises, pour permettre à l'accusé de réélire, s'il le juge à propos, suivant
le Code Criminel  et ses amendments.

Mtrs Lucien Cannon s'oppose de la part de
la Couronne à cette demande;

La Cour décide qu'il faut procéder.

[Page 160]

The only application made to the court was for a
postponement of the trial to the next assizes to permit the accused to
re-elect, if he should think fit. That motion was simply refused. Apart from
the fact that there had been no previous election and the case was therefore
not one for re-election, what took place at the assize court certainly did not
amount to an election for a speedy trial. There was not even an intimation that
such an election would be made if the postponement asked for were granted.
There was therefore no refusal ""to grant acte of an option made by
the accused for a speedy trial."" He had made no such option and an acte
of such an option therefore was not and could not have been sought or
refused. The first question must be answered accordingly. It is not within our
province, as was held by a majority of this court in the recent case of Scott
v. The King (24th of Feb., 1921), materially to modify, qualify or
enlarge the scope of a question in a reserved case merely because it does not
cover the ground of appeal which counsel presents to the court, although that
should appear to be what the appellant conceives to be his substantial
grievance.

(2) In not discharging the six additional jurors
over the required panel of 60 (R.S.Q., Art. 3438) the court exercised a
discretion conferred on it by R.S.Q., Art. 3459. The six additional jurors
having been lawfully retained I am not satisfied that their names were not
properly placed in the panel box (Crim. Code, s. 927), from which the names of
the petit jury were drawn. As is pointed out by Mr. Justice Martin, only sixty
jurors answered the roll call on the day of the trial. Six were absent. No
juror called for the trial was in fact challenged by the appellant. The only
objection taken on his behalf on this branch of

[Page 161]

the case which appeared to be of moment, viz.,
that the proportion of peremptory challenges which he was entitled to exercise
was disturbed by the presence of the six additional jurors, thus appears to be
lacking in substance. His right of challenge was not in fact affected. Even if
there was something done at the trial not according to law, the right of
challenge not having been interfered with, s. 1019  of the Criminal Code 
precludes the granting of a new trial since no substantial wrong or miscarriage
was occasioned.

Brodeur J.—Il s'agit d'un appel dans une cause criminelle. Deux questions
nous sont soumises. La première a trait à la juridiction de la cour qui a
condamné l'accusé. La seconde est de savoir si le petit jury a été validement
constitué.

L'accusé avait été arrêté pour vol à main armée
sous la disposition de l’article 446  du Code criminel . Il a été amené devant le
juge des Sessions de la Paix le 18 septembre 1920, pour y subir sommairement
son procès: mais, comme il en avait le droit, il a opté pour un procès devant
la cour du Banc du Roi (arts. 777-778), c'est-à-dire, un procês par jury.

Le juge des Sessions de la Paix a alors procédé
à l'enquête préliminaire et l'accusé a été, le 12 octobre, condamné à subir son
procês. Le dossier constate qu'avant la déclaration du juge qu'il y avait
matière à procès (commitment) l'accusé s'est évadé de la prison où il était
incarcéré.

Le 13 octobre, un acte d'accusation (indictment)
fut présenté au grand jury par les avocats de la Couronne, qui l’avaient signé
comme suit:

L. A. Taschereau, Attorney-General, by Aimé
Marchand, Lucien Cannon, duly authorized.

[Page 162]

Cet acte d'accusation portait en outre sur le dos
l'inscription suivante signée de la main du Procureur-Général lui-même:

This indictment is preferred by the
undersigned, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.

L. A.
Taschereau,

Attorney-General
for the Province of Quebec.

L'acte d'accusation fut rapporté comme fondé le
même jour par le grand jury et de suite l'accusé fut mis en jugement (arraigned) et il plaida non-coupable.

Le 15, au moment où son procés devait commencer et avant que l'on procédât à
choisir le petit jury, l'accusé par son avocat a demandé verbalement à la cour

la remise de la cause aux prochaines assises
pour permettre à l'accusé de réélire s'il le juge à propos.

La Couronne s'y est objectée et le procès a eu lieu
et l'accusé a été condamné. Il prétend maintenant qu'il a été illégalement
privé du droit d'opter pour un procès expéditif et que lorsque les petits jurés
ont été tirés au sort il y avait dans la boîte où les cartes étaient déposées
soixante-six noms, c'est-à-dire six de plus que le nombre déterminé par la loi.

Ce dernier point ne paraît pas avoir été soulevé en
temps utile. D'ailleurs rien ne démontre qu'aucun texte de loi ait été violé.

Le shérif, sous les dispositions des articles 3438 et 3455 des statuts revisés de Québec, avait le pouvoir d'assigner plus que
soixante jurés. Et si après avoir examiné les demandes d'exemption des jurés il
reste plus de soixante jurés présents, le juge peut renvoyer le surplus. La loi
ne lui en fait pas une obligation: au contraire, elle paraît laisser cela à sa
discrétion. Il peut arriver, en effet, que le terme soit bien chargé, qu'un
grand nombre de causes aient à être décidées et jugées: et alors, suivant sa
discrétion, le juge peut garder

[Page 163]

plus de soixante jurés. C'est ce qui a été fait
dans le cas actuel. Le juge n'a donc violé aucun texte de loi: mais il a simplement exercé une discrétion
qu'il pouvait exercer.

L'autre question qui nous est soumise touche à la
juridiction de la cour et a trait au droit de l'accusé d'opter pour un procès
expéditif.

La Cour du Banc du Roi avait certainement
juridiction pour juger l'accusé. L'offense qui lui était imputée désignait ce
tribunal comme ayant le droit de juger l'accusé.

Un acte d'accusation a été porté contre l'accusé et
le grand jury a rapporté cet acte d'accusation comme bien fondé. Sur le dos de
cet acte d'accusation on trouve la signature du procureur-général déclarant que
cet acte d'accusation avait été présenté au grand jury sur ses instructions
formelles.

Avant l'amendement du code criminel de 1909, un accusé d'une offense comme celle qui
est imputée à Collins avait le
droit absolu de demander à subir son procès devant le juge des Sessions de la
Paix: mais par l'amendement de 1909 ce droit lui est refusé lorsque (825-5) le procureur-général requiert que le procès se fasse devant un jury. La
loi ajoute que le Procureur Général peut faire cette demande bien que l'accusé
ait consenti à être jugé par le juge des Sessions.

Il me semble que la signature du procureur-général
sur l'acte d'accusation constitue
cette demande dont parle l'article 825-5 du code criminel. Je serais enclin à croire d'un autre côtê également
que du moment que le procureur-général, sous l'article 873,
porte devant la grand jury une accusation, qu'il y ait eu
enquête préliminaire ou non, dès ce moment-là la cour du Banc du Roi est dûment
saisie de la cause et qu'elle peut la juger et en disposer. Nous n'avons pas

[Page 164]

à examiner ce qui s'est passé antérieurement; et si
l'accusé, comme il Ta fait dans le cas actuel, demande un procès expéditif, la
cour a parfaitement le droit de lui refuser ce privilége et de procéder à faire
juger la cause par un jury.

Dans le cas actuel, je considère que l'action du procureur-général
en signant lui-même l'acte d'accusation démontre d'une manière explicite qu'il
requérait que la cause fût jugée par un jury (825-5 C.C.). C'est là un droit absolu de la part du procureur-général, et il
a suffisamment exprimé le désir d'exercer ce droit pour qu'on ne puisse pas
prétendre que la cour soit sans juridiction. Il serait désirable cependant que
cette réquisition fût insérée dans le dossier originaire afin d'enlever au juge
des Sessions toute apparence de juridiction.

Nous ne pouvons pas mettre de côté une
condamnation, même s'il été fait quelque chose de non conforme à la loi et si
des instructions erronées ont été données, à moins qu'il n'en soit résulté un
tort réel ou un déni de justice. Je suis incapable de trouver dans la cause
actuelle aucune illégalité qui ait pu constituer un déni de justice (art. 1019  C.Cr.).

La Couronne avait le droit de requérir que l'accusé
subisse son procès devant la Cour Criminelle; la cour, dans sa discrétion, était justifiable de refuser à l'accusé un
ajournement; le choix des petits jurés ne s'est pas fait illégalement. La
condamnation qui a été infligée à l'accusé doit être maintenue.

L'appel doit être renvoyé avec dépens.

Mignault J.—This appeal comes to this court on two questions as to both of which
Mr. Justice Greenshields dissented from the majority judgment of the Court of
King's Bench:

[Page 165]

1. Was there error in refusing to grant acte
of the option made by the accused for a speedy trial before the judge of
the Sessions without the intervention of a jury?

2. If it was the fact that cards to the
number of 66 bearing the names, numbers and addresses of 66 petit jurymen were
placed in the panel box for the purpose provided, did it constitute an
irregularity or illegality sufficient to entitle the accused to the relief
sought?

First question. The appellant's counsel argued
this question as if it were quite a different question, namely, whether under
section 826  et seq., Criminal Code , he should have been brought before a judge
and the statement required by sect. 827 made to him, at which time and on which
statement being made to him he would have been afforded the opportunity of
exercising, if he saw fit, an option for a speedy trial or to be tried in the
ordinary way. I think I sufficiently stated in Minguy v. The King[6], what procedure should
be followed in cases like this one.

But this is not the question we have to answer.
And I propose to reply to the question submitted in the negative because the
appellant never made an option for a speedy trial, and therefore there was no
option of which acte (to use the language of the question) should have
been granted.

This does not necessarily mean that I disagree
with what Mr. Justice Greenshields said on this first point, but under the
question put to the court there is no necessity of expressing any opinion on
this point.

Second point. I would also answer this question
in the negative for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of
King's Bench, which are entirely satisfactory to me.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Manslaughter—Person killed by
automobile—Criminal liability of driver—Degree of care—Sections 247 and 258 Cr.
C.

The driver of an automobile, who fails to
take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid,
danger to human life is, under section 247  of the Criminal Code , criminally
responsible for the consequences.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1921] 1
W.W.R. 443) affirmed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], on a
reserved case for the opinion of that court. The appellant was convicted of
manslaughter for unlawfully killing a workman who was working in a manhole in
the street by striking him with his motor car, and the conviction was sustained
by the Court of Appeal.

The material facts of the case are stated in
the judgments now reported.

Geo. F. Henderson for the appellant.

Harold Fisher for the respondent.

[Page 41]

Idington J.—The appellant whilst in charge of and driving an automobile in
one of the streets of Regina, ran it over an obstacle described as follows by
the learned trial judge:—

The tarpaulin was thrown over a form
extending about five or six feet from north to south, and looking at it from
the north or from the south it was in the shape of an inverted V. The top of
this V would be somewhere between four and five feet high. Possibly nearer four
than five feet. The width of the bottom of the V would be between three and
four feet. The measurements were not given at the trial, but a witness erected
a tarpaulin at the trial, in the presence of the court and jury to represent
its position at the time of the accident.

The structure so described covered a manhole in
the street where three men were working for the provincial telephone
department, and one of them was killed as the result of this adventure on the
part of the appellant.

For so killing that man appellant was indicted
for manslaughter and found guilty thereof.

The street in question was a wide one on which
there was ample room for appellant to have driven the car in question over the
unobstructed part of the street and passed the said structure in safety.

The learned trial judge submitted, after said
conviction, a reserved case containing the following question:!—

1. Did I properly instruct the jury as to
the negligence which under the circumstances of the case, would render the
accused guilty of manslaughter?

2.—In view of the fact that there was no
evidence that the accused saw the deceased nor knew that the deceased was under
the tarpaulin referred to in the evidence, could the accused be found guilty of
manslaughter?

The learned judges of the Court of Appeal with
the exception of Mr. Justice Newlands, answered these questions in the
affirmative and sustained the conviction.

[Page 42]

The opinion of the majority was written by Mr.
Justice Lamont who reviewed at length many decisions which support the judgment
now appealed from, if any needed beyond the relevant section of the Criminal
Code  which I am about to quote.

Mr. Justice Newlands held that in light of some
expressions in decisions of long ago that

there must be gross negligence before there
is criminal liability (and that) the want of ordinary reasonable care which an
ordinary prudent man would have observed, although sufficient to render the
accused liable in a civil action, is not sufficient in a criminal case.

Several of the cases he cites were mere nisi
prius expressions which are not at the present day of much value, even if,
as I submit, possibly relevant to the then state of the law.

The law applicable to this case is to be found
in section 247  of the Criminal Code , cited by Mr. Justice Lamont, which reads
as follows:—

247.—Everyone who has in his charge or
under his control anything whatever animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes
or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or care may
endanger human life, is under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions
against and use reasonable care to avoid, such danger and is criminally
responsible for the consequences of omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform
such duty.

This was first enacted in the Criminal Code  of
1892, section 13.

It leaves no room for the refined distinctions
between ' negligence and gross negligence.

It imposes an absolute duty on the part of him
having charge of that which in its use may endanger human life, to take
precaution and care.

It should not, I respectfully submit, be
frittered away by any refinement on the part of judges.

[Page 43]

The learned trial judge's charge throughout was
absolutely correct until he momentarily, on objection, interjected the remark
that there was a possible distinction between that which would render a man
liable for civil damages for negligence, and that which would render him liable
criminally.

Even if the distinction had been maintainable as
I hold it is not in the application of this section, he seems to have covered
the ground.

I should have preferred the charge before so
amended.

Section 1019  of the Criminal Code , which reads
as follows:—

1019.—No conviction shall be set aside nor
any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly
admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the
trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the court of
appeal, some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial: Provided that if the court of appeal is of opinion that any challenge
for the defence was improperly disallowed, a new trial shall be granted,

might, if need be for which in my view there is
none, be relied upon. If Mr. Justice Newland's view is correct it should be
applied.

The negligence here in question which led to
appellant's motor car running over such an obstacle on the street as the above
description presents when ample space to pass it without doing so, was so
palpably gross that there was not much to be found in the way of palliation
even if the old saws about gross negligence could be invoked and relied upon.

There was, in my opinion, no miscarriage of
justice.

The appeal should, I think, be dismissed.

Duff J.—Section 258  of the Criminal Code  does not I think, substantially
change the common law. In this I agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Sedge-

[Page 44]

wick delivered on behalf of the court, in the Union
Colliery Company's Case[2].
There may, I think, be cases in which the judges ought to tell the jury that
the conduct of the accused in order to incriminate him under this section must
be such as to imply a certain indifference to consequences, but such cases, I
think, must be rare and this assuredly is not one of them. Where the accused,
having brought into operation a dangerous agency which he has under his
control, (that is to say dangerous in the sense that it is calculated to
endanger human life), fails to take those precautions which a man of ordinary
humanity and reasonably competent understanding would take in the given
circumstances for the purpose of avoiding or neutralizing the risk, his conduct
in itself implies a degree of recklessness justifying the description
""gross negligence."" The facts of course may disclose an explanation
or excuse bringing the accused's conduct within the category of
""reasonable"" conduct. But as Vaughan J. said long ago in Bushell's
case[3], the judge does not
charge the jury with matters of law in the abstract but only upon that law as
growing out of some supposition of fact; and it is much better in such a case
as the present, (where, in the absence of explanation, the conduct of the
accused—driving a motor through a frequented street at the rate of 12 miles an
hour without seeing the road clearly before him—plainly inculpates him) that
the trial judge should seek, as Mr. Justice Lamont did, to bring the jury to
concentrate their attention upon the various matters alleged in explanation and
excuse.

[Page 45]

Anglin J.—I would dismiss this appeal. There was dissent in the court of
appeal only upon the first question of the reserved case. To that question s.
247  of the Criminal Code  precludes any but an affirmative answer. Failure to
take reasonable precautions against, and to use reasonable care to avoid,
danger to human life is thereby declared to entail criminal responsibility for
the consequences. There is nothing in s. 16 , referred to by Mr. Henderson, to
qualify this explicit declaration; and s. 258  has no bearing, in my opinion, on
a case of manslaughter. It would be most unfortunate if anything should be said
or done in this court to countenance the idea that a motor car may be driven
with immunity from criminal responsibility if reasonable precautions be not
taken against, and reasonable care be not used to avoid, danger to human life.
As Mr. Justice Bigham said on the trial of a chauffeur for manslaughter by
running over a woman in a London street:—

There is a greater responsibility on a
person engineering a dangerous machine like a large motor car about the streets
than on a man driving a one horse brougham. Rex v. Davis.[4]

What are reasonable precautions and what is
reasonable care depends in every case upon the circumstances. Carelessness
which ought to have been recognized as not unlikely to imperil human life
cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as aught else than culpable negligence.

Brodeur J.—This appeal arises out of a conviction for manslaughter in the
case of a man driving negligently an automobile.

[Page 46]

It is contended by the accused that there must
be gross negligence to incur criminal liability and that the degree of
negligence must be higher in criminal cases than in civil cases.

A large number of cases have been quoted to us
on this point and they might appear somewhat conflicting though I think that
they could be reconciled by a careful examination of the facts in each case.
But the language itself of the Criminal Code  disposes of this issue. It says in
article 247 :—

Everyone who has in his charge or under his
control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate * * * which, in the
absence of precaution or care, may endanger human life, is under a legal duty
to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to
avoid such danger and is criminally responsible for the consequences of
omitting without lawful excuse to perform such duty.

Nobody will dispute the fact that an automobile
negligently driven is a dangerous thing. Then the driver of his automobile on
the street is bound to take reasonable precaution and use reasonable care to
avoid any danger.

If our legislators intended to state that there
would be criminal liability only in the case of reckless or gross negligence,
they would certainly have so declared their intent. But they simply
incorporated in our criminal statutes these expressions so well known and so
fully construed in the cases of civil negligence.

The absence of reasonable care in driving an
automobile may then create a criminal liability. The following cases may be
quoted in support of this contention: Reg. v. Murray[5]; Rex v. Grout[6]; The Queen v. Dalloway[7].

Even if we construe the judge's charge as the
appellant contends, I consider it legal and sufficient.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 47]

Mignault J.—The appellant was tried on an indictment for manslaughter for
having, when driving a motor car in a public street of Regina, caused the death of one Percy Young. The learned trial judge, in
charging the jury, directed them as to the law governing the case as follows:—

It has been decided and I am going to tell
you that the law is, that every person who drives a motor car has a duty to
drive it with such care and caution as to prevent, so far as is in his power,
any accident or injury to any other person; that is, he has got to use all
reasonable precaution to see that no person is injured through his want of
caution or precaution.

After the charge, counsel for the accused
complained that the learned judge should have told the jury that a greater
degree of negligence was required in a criminal case than in a civil one, and
the learned judge recalled the jury and gave them this further direction:—

I am also asked to direct your attention to
the fact that in a criminal case the degree of negligence which renders a man
culpably negligent is greater than in a civil case. I think that is quite so,
and I am going to charge you to that effect—that while in a civil case a man
may be liable to an action for damages, in a criminal case it would take a
greater degree of negligence to render him liable. That is so. But in this case
it is for you to say whether or not the accused, driving a vehicle of that sort
along the streets of the city took that care which it was the duty of an ordinary
prudent man to take in order to avoid doing damage to some person else on the
street. If you come to the conclusion that he did not take that care, and that
it was in consequence of that want of care that the death of Young took place,
then he is guilty; if he did take that care he is not guilty.

Notwithstanding Mr. Henderson's able argument, I
cannot come to the conclusion that the jury was misdirected. Section 247  of the
Criminal Code  states the law as follows:—

Everyone who has in his charge or under his
control anything whatever, whether animate or inanimate, or who erects, makes
or maintains anything whatever which, in the absence of precaution or

[Page 48]

care, may endanger human life, is under a
legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable care to
avoid, such danger, and is criminally responsible for the consequences of
omitting, without lawful excuse, to perform such duty.

I think the charge is fully supported by this
section. It was the duty of the accused to take reasonable precautions to avoid
endangering human life, and the jury was told so. It was then for the jury to
determine whether the accused had taken these precautions.

Naturally, in the offence of manslaughter, there
may be a greater or less degree of guilt according to the circumstances of each
case. I see no reason to doubt that the degree of guilt in this case will be
duly considered when sentence is pronounced on the jury's verdict.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law —Principal guilty of
manslaughter—Abettor afterwards convicted of murder—Charge—Explanations as to
manslaughter—Sections 69, 262 Cr. C.

The appellant was tried for murder and found
guilty. The victim had been killed by the appellant's son, at the instigation
of his father. The son, having had his trial 'previously, had been found guilty
of manslaughter.

Held, that the
appellant could be convicted of murder.

The trial judge in his charge, after reading
section 259 Cr. C., explained to the jurors the nature of murder and instructed
them that they could find one of three verdicts against the accused, murder,
manslaughter or acquittal. While he did not read section 262 Cr. C. which
refers to manslaughter, in discussing provocation and the defences set up by
the appellant of self-defence and protection of the home, he explained under
what circumstances the verdict might be one of manslaughter.

Held, Brodeur
J. dissenting, that the trial judge sufficiently instructed the jury as to what
in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter.

Per Brodeur J.
(dissenting).—There was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a
verdict of manslaughter, if they had been properly instructed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, dismissing an appeal by the appellant
relating to questions of law arising on his trial for murder and upon a stated
case.

[Page 22]

The appellant was charged with having
murdered one Morissette and found guilty. Morissette was killed as the result
of a rifle shot which was fired by the son of the appellant at the victim, who
had called late at night under peculiar circumstances. The trial of the son was
held first upon an indictment of murder; and he was found guilty of
manslaughter. At the trial of the appellant the judge, in his charge to the
jury, explained the nature of murder, quoting section 259 Cr. C. He also cited
section 261 Cr. C., on the defence of provocation, section 53 Cr. C. dealing
with self defence against assaults and section 60 Cr. C. on the defence of
dwelling-house at night. The judge did not read section 262 Cr. C. as to
manslaughter. The two questions submitted to the courts were: 1, as the son was
convicted of manslaughter, the appellant, as aider and abettor, could not be
found guilty of murder; and 2, the charge was illegal as the jury were not
sufficiently instructed as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter.

N. K. Laflamme K.C. and M. A. Lemieux
K.C. for the appellant.

Aimé Marchand K.C. and Lucien Cannon K.C.
for the respondent.

Idington J.—The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted therefor.

The Court of King's Bench has, with the
exception of Mr. Justice Guerin, so answered the questions submitted in a
reserved case relative thereto as to maintain the conviction.

[Page 23]

The pith of the dissenting opinion of Mr.
Justice Guerin in said court which gives appellant the right to come here, and
is the measure of our jurisdiction to interfere, is that because appellant's
son on another indictment for murder, resting on same killing, had on his trial
been only found guilty of manslaughter, therefore the appellant cannot be found
guilty of any greater offence than that of manslaughter.

The contention is a most remarkable one and
seems to me to have been so well and effectually answered by the several
opinions of the other judges in the court below writing opinions with which I
substantially agree, that I do not feel at liberty to repeat same here. Some of
them illustrate the unfounded nature of such pretensions as made, by various
alternatives.

I only add another and that is if this case, as
it might have been in law, had been tried before the other, despite what
appellant's counsel suggests is customary in such cases, how could he have
invoked the pretension of law now set up?

The appeal should be dismissed.

Duff J.—I have carefully considered the charge of the trial judge and I
am by no means satisfied that he instructed the jury insufficiently touching
the elements of the offence of manslaughter and the distinctions between that
offence and murder.

I am unable to perceive any force in the
argument founded upon the verdict and judgment against the younger Remillard.

Anglin J.—In my opinion this appeal fails. The fact that in another trial
another jury passing upon evidence which may have been somewhat different
decided that the offence committed by Roméo Rémillard

[Page 24]

in killing Lucien Morissette amounted only to
manslaughter is wholly irrelevant to the question whether Joseph Rémillard
could rightly be put on trial for, and could upon proof that he had aided,
abetted or instigated, the homicide, be convicted of murder. As between Romeo
Rémillard and the Crown the verdict of the jury who tried him is no doubt
conclusive as to the nature of his crime. As between Joseph Rémillard and the
Crown it determines nothing. The character of the offence actually committed by
each must be decided by the jury charged with the disposition of the indictment
gainst him. To the first question in the reserved case the only possible answer
was in the negative.

The learned judge, in my opinion, sufficiently
instructed the jury as to the three verdicts which may be rendered on an
indictment for murder and as to the distinction between murder and
manslaughter. He discussed adequately and correctly all the relevant grounds on
which in this case the culpable homicide charged to have been aided, abetted or
instigated by Joseph Rémillard might possibly have been reduced from murder to
manslaughter. Having read to the jury the definitive provisions of s. 259  of
the Criminal Code  dealing with murder, he instructed them that, if the homicide
were not excusable, their verdict should be guilty of manslaughter, unless the
facts proved warranted a verdict of murder. That was equivalent to a reading to
them of s. 262 of the Code—the omission of which from the charge was made the
subject of serious complaint. The learned judge also read and explained s. 261 ,
which deals with the effect of provocation, and discussed the several matters
suggested in the course of the defence by way of excuse and in palliation.
Without characterizing the

[Page 25]

charge as a model presentation of the case to
the jury, with Mr. Justice Carroll I regard it as fulfilling the requirements
of the law and not warranting interference by an appellate court on any ground
covered by the reserved case.

The second and third questions should, in my
opinion, be answered as they were by the Court of King's Bench.

Brodeur J. (dissenting).—Trois questions
principales nous ont été soumises. La première porte sur
la validité d'un verdict de meurtre contre un complice quand l'auteur de
l'homicide n'aurait été trouvé coupable que de manslaughter.
Par les deux autres questions
on nous demande si le juge qui présidait au procès a suffisamment expliqué la
différence entre le meurtre et le manslaughter.

L'appelant est accusé d'avoir tué un nommé
Morissette, et il a été trouvé coupable de meurtre. Ce n'est pas lui cependant
qui a tiré le coup de fusil qui a été malheureusement fatal, mais c'est son
fils Roméo. L'accusé dans la présente cause n'a été que le complice de
l'infraction.

Certains témoins, qui, je le suppose, ont été crus
par le jury mais dont le témoignage est contredit par d'autres témoins, ont
déclaré que le père, l'accusé en la présente cause, avait incité son fils à
tirer sur la victime. C'est à raison de cette circonstance, je suppose, que la
Couronne a persisté tout de même à procéder sur une accusation de meurtre
contre le complice quand l'auteur lui-même du crime n'avait été trouvé coupable
que de manslaughter.

L'article 69 du code criminel justifie cette procédure, vu qu'il met sur le même
pied l'auteur et le complice d'une infraction et il les déclare tous

[Page 26]

les deux coupables de l'offence elle-même. Celui
qui aide, provoque ou conseille un assassinat peut donc être trouvé coupable de
meurtre lui-même, malgré qu'il n'ait pas perpétré lui-même le fait qui a
produit la mort.

Nos lois criminelles depuis leur codification ont
fait disparaître cette classification un peu subtile des accusés en principaux
au premier degré, en principaux au deuxième degré et en complices avant le
fait. Elles ont mis tous ces criminels sur le même pied. Chacun d'eux peut être
poursuivi pour l'offense principale elle-même, quand bien même il n'aurait
qu'aidé, assisté ou conseillé l'auteur du forfait (Russell
on Crime, 6ème édition, pp. 176-177).

Ainsi dans le cas d'assassinat, celui qui a
simplement provoqué une personne à tuer peut être mis en accusation de meurtre
comme s'il avait porté lui-même le coup qui a terrassé la victime. Hawkins, ""Pleas of the Crown,"" 8ème édition,
vol. 2 p. 439, déclare que, même dans un cas d'homicide, le complice
pourrait être trouvé coupable de meurtre lorsque l'auteur lui-même du crime ne
serait coupable que de manslaughter.

All those who are present when a felony is
committed and abet the doing of it, as by holding the party while another
strikes him or by delivering a weapon to him that strikes him, or by moving him
to strike, are principal in the highest degree in respect of such abetment, as
much as the person who does the act, which in judgment of law is as much the
act of them all as if they had actually done it: and if there were malice in the
abettor and none in the person who struck the party *** it will be murder as to
the abettor and manslaughter as to the other.

Dans le cas actuellement devant nous le jury
pouvait rendre un verdict de meurtre même si l'accusé n'eut été que le complice
et n'eut pas porté lui-même le coup fatal. Chaque cause pouvait être jugée
suivant son propre mérite et suivant la

[Page 27]

preuve qui serait faite dans chacune d'elle sur la
nature de l'offense. Le verdict dans l'une ne devait pas nécessairement être
adopté dans l'autre cause.

La première question qui nous est soumise devrait
donc recevoir une réponse négative.

Quant aux deux autres questions qui ont trait aux
instructions du juge au jury, je ne puis pas en venir à la même conclusion que
la Cour du Banc du Roi.

La question dans la cause était de savoir d'abord
s'il y avait eu homicide coupable. L'accusé a tenté d'établir que l'assassinat
avait été commis sous l'effet d'une provocation et qu'il était accidentel. Ces
deux moyens de défense auraient pu le libérer de toute offence
criminelle s'ils avaient été prouvés.

Le juge, dans son allocution aux jurés, s'est
attaché à démontrer que la provocation n'était pas suffisante pour justifier
Roméo Rémillard de faire l'acte qu'il a commis et que le coup de feu qui a été
tiré ne pouvait pas être rangé dans la catégorie des accidents.

Après avoir lu soigneusement toute la preuve, je me
suis convaincu moi-même que la provocation qui a été invoquée n'était pas
suffisante pour pouvoir justifier l'homicide; et je ne crois pas non plus que
les circonstances où le coup de feu a été tiré peuvent ranger l'acte accompli
dans la catégorie d'actions qui, purement accidentelles, peuvent libérer
complètement l'auteur de l'acte ou ses complices. Il y a donc, suivant moi,
homicide coupable. L'homicide n'était pas justifiable ni excusable.

Mais cet homicide était-il volontaire ou
involontaire? En d'autres termes y a-t-il eu meurtre ou simplement manslaughter?

Le juge malheureusement ne paraît pas avoir fait
ressortir suffisamment la distinction entre ces deux offenses de meurtre et de manslaughter.

[Page 28]

L'honorable juge Carroll
qui présidait la Cour du Banc du Roi et qui a décidé
contre l'appelant, après avoir déclaré dans ses notes que l'allocution du juge
est légale dans son ensemble, ajoute cependant qu'elle a pu

produire chez les jurés l'impression qu'aucun
autre verdict que celui de meurtre ne pouvait être rendu.

Dans ce cas, peut-on dire que le juge a
suffisamment renseigné le juré sur les faits de la cause dans leurs rapports
avec le crime de manslaughter? Il n'y a pas de doute, suivant moi, comme je l'ai dit plus haut, que la
provocation et le caractère accidentel du coup de feu ne pouvaient pas empêcher
l'accusé d'être coupable d'homicide; car quand bien même des personnes auraient
jugé à propos de venir faire visite à sa femme à une heure indue de la nuit,
l'accusé n'aurait pas été justifiable de prendre un fusil et de les tuer. La
provocation n'était pas suffisante pour cela.

Mais si dans le but de protéger son foyer contre la
mauvaise réputation que la visite nocturne de ces jeunes gens peut lui imputer
et si prenant un fusil il tente de leur tirer dans les jambes et si comme
résultat de l'excitation ou par maladresse le coup va porter sur une partie
vitale de l'un de ces visiteurs, sans aucune intention de sa part de causer la
mort, n'y a-t-il pas lieu alors pour le juge de bien faire la distinction entre
l'offense qui constitue un meurtre et celle qui constitue un manslaughter?

C'est ce qui n'a pas été fait dans cette cause-ci.
L'allocution, au contraire, a porté sur ces incidents comme éléments du crime
de meurtre, lorsque la preuve démontrait plutôt que les jurés étaient en
présence d'un crime de manslaughter.

[Page 29]

Il me paraît évident, pour ma part, qu'il n'y avait
pas intention de tuer mais simplement de faire une démonstration qui
empêcheraient ces visiteurs de répéter leurs visites nocturnes et de les
forcer, eux et leurs semblables, de respecter le foyer de l'accusé. Sa pauvre
femme était malheureusement victime de la boisson et ses moeurs, comme il
arrive d'ordinaire dans tous ces cas, étaient un objet de scandale pour sa
propre famille. Alors l'accusé a voulu la protéger contre ceux qui seraient
tentés de profiter de ces faiblesses pour déshonorer son foyer.

Cela ne saurait justifier un droit cependant de
prendre une arme à feu et de tuer ces visiteurs. Mais si, comme dans le cas
actuel, le juge doit insister pour dire aux jurés qu'il y a crime, il doit le
faire de façon à leur faire bien comprendre ce qu'est le meurtre, ce qu'est le manslaughter. Prenant la phrase que j'ai
détachée de l'opinion du juge Carroll, je dis que si l'allocution du juge a pu produire chez les jurés
l'impression qu'aucun autre verdict que celui de meurtre pouvait étre rendu, il
doit y avoir an nouveau procès.

Le juge ne doit pas se contenter de citer
généralement le texte du code qui nous dit que sur une accusation de meurtre un
accusé peut être trouvé coupable de meurtre, de manslaughter,
ou acquitté; il ne doit pas non plus donner une
définition plus ou moins vague de ces deux offenses, mais il doit considérer
ces deux offenses à la lumière des faits prouvés et dire aux jurés d'une
manière claire et précise les relations des faits prouvés avec le crime de
meurtre et de manslaughter. Le but de l'allocution du juge aux jurés est de leur expliquer la loi
qui gouverne la cause, de montrer les points essentiels qui doivent être
prouvés de côté et d'autre, les relations de la preuve aux points en litige.
Aussi dans un cas où les faits prouvés sont

[Page 30]

tout à la fois susceptibles de produire un verdict
pour deux offenses différentes, il devient nécessaire pour le juge de
déterminer qu'il y a criminalité et aussi de montrer clairement le degré de
cette criminalité en rapport avec les offenses dont l'accusé peut être trouvé
coupable.

Le juge doit définir le crime imputé à l'accusé et
il doit également expliquer la différence entre ce crime et tout autre dont il
pourrait être trouvé coupable. Le défaut pour le juge de renseigner le jury sur
le meurtre et le manslaughter a
été jugé suffisant dans la cause de The King v. Wong On[1], pour ordonner nouveau procès.

Sir James Stephen, dans son ouvrage ""General
View of Criminal Law,"" 2ème édition, p. 170, dit ceci:

I think that a judge who merely states to
the jury certain propositions of law and then reads over his notes does not
discharge his duty.

Une cause à peu près semblable à la présente a été décidée en Angleterre il n'y a
que quelques années; c'est celle de King v. Hopper[2].

Il s'agissait, dans cette cause de Hopper, d'une accusation de meurtre; et
l'accusé, comme dans la présente cause, plaidait provocation et accident. Au
procès, le juge a fermement exprimé l'opinion que c'était un cas de meurtre ou
d'acquittement. Il n'a pas voulu déclarer que la provocation et l'accident
pouvaient être tels que l'offense pût être considérée comme manslaughter. Lord Reading, qui a rendu le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, a décidé que les circonstances
prouvées pouvaient justifier un verdict de manslaughter
et que le juge aurait dû instruire le jury en
conséquence.

[Page 31]

Dans le cause actuelle, le juge, il est vrai, n'a
pas été aussi positif que dans la cause de Hopper; mais il a tout de même laissé le jury sous l'impression que le seul
verdict qui pouvait être rendu était celui de meurtre.

Je suis d'opinion, pour ces raisons, que les
instructions du juge au jury étaient incomplètes et par conséquent illégales.

Il devrait y avoir un nouveau procès et l'appel
devrait être maintenu.

Mignault J.—The appellant having been tried at Quebec on an indictment for
the murder of one Lucien Morissette before Mr. Justice Désy and a jury, was
found guilty and death sentence was passed on him. The learned trial judge
refused to state certain questions for the opinion of the Court of King's Bench
sitting in appeal, but on appeal to the latter court, he was ordered to state
for the opinion of that court the following questions:

1°. Should I have told the jury, as a
matter of law, that the author of the crime, Roméo Rémillard, having been by
another jury previously convicted of the crime of manslaughter, the accused (if
in the opinion of the jury he was an aider and abettor) could not be convicted
of the crime of murder; but the only verdict that could be rendered was one for
manslaughter or acquittal?

2°. (a) Should I have pointed out to the
jury the three verdicts that could be rendered upon a charge of murder, viz.:
guilty of murder, guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty?

(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct
the jury?

3°. (a) Should I have pointed out to the
jury what in law constituted the offence of manslaughter?

(b) If yes, did I sufficiently so instruct
the jury?

After hearing counsel, the Court of King's Bench
answered the first question in the negative, the two branches of question two
in the affirmative and the two branches of question three also in the
affirmative.

[Page 32]

Mr. Justice Guerin dissented and would have
answered question one in the affirmative, the first branches of question two
and three in the affirmative and the second branches of these questions in the
negative.

This dissent permitted the further appeal which
has been taken to this court, and, in view of its terms, the whole case is open
for review. It should be remarked, as to questions two and three, that the five
judges were of opinion that it was the duty of the trial judge to direct the
jury in the manner stated in the first branches of these questions, the
majority of the learned judges being of opinion that the trial judge had
sufficiently instructed the jury on the points referred to.

First question. Briefly
stated the contention of counsel for the appellant is that the learned trial
judge should have told the jury that inasmuch as Roméo Rémillard, the
appellant's son, who fired the fatal shot, was previously tried on an
indictment for the murder of Lucien Morissette, and found guilty of
manslaughter only, the appellant, if in the opinion of the jury he was an aider
and abettor, could not be convicted of the crime of murder, but that the only
verdict that could be rendered was one for manslaughter or acquittal.

The circumstances under which the jury found a
verdict of murder against the appellant are not mentioned in the reserved case,
and cannot be perfectly ascertained by reading the charge to the jury, in which
the learned trial judge commented on facts well known to the jury. I think
however that we have only to deal with the facts assumed in question one, that
is to say that Roméo Rémillard was the author of the crime, and was previously
convicted by another

[Page 33]

jury of manslaughter. We must also assume that
there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the appellant was an
aider and abettor in the crime committed by Roméo Rémillard.

Assuming these facts, in order to determine
whether it was the duty of the learned trial judge to direct the jury that the
only verdict they could find against the appellant was one for manslaughter or
acquittal, it is necessary to consider certain sections of the Criminal Code .
The old distinction between accessories before the fact and principals has been
abolished, and section 69 , paragraph 1 , of the Criminal Code  enumerates those
who are parties to, and guilty of, an offence.

Every one is a party to and guilty of an
offence who,—

(a) actually commits it; or

(b) does or omits an act for the purpose of
aiding any person to commit the offence; or,

(c) abets any person in commission of the
offence; or,

(d) counsels or procures any person to
commit the offence.

Paragraph (a) of subsection 1 applies to Roméo
Rémillard, who actually committed the offence, and the other paragraphs
comprise those who formerly were termed accessories before the fact, and who
are now, equally with the perpetrator, parties to and guilty of the offence. If
the jury were of the opinion that the appellant was an aider and abettor in the
offence committed by Roméo Rémillard, they could undoubtedly find him a party
to and guilty of this offence.

To aid or abet is defined as follows in Stroud's
Judicial Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 64:

To constitute an aider or abettor, some
active steps must be taken, by word or action, with intent to instigate the
principal or principals. Encouragement does not, of necessity, amount to
aiding and abetting. It may be intentional or unintentional. A man may

[Page 34]

unwittingly encourage another in fact by
his presence, by misinterpreted words or gestures, or by his silence or
non-interference:—or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures,
or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets;
in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by a mere passive
spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is
not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely
present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it,
though he might reasonably be expected to prevent it and had the power so to do
or at least to express his dissent, might, under some circumstances, afford
cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he
wilfully encouraged, and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a
question for the jury whether he did so or not (per Hawkins, J., The Queen v.
Coney[3]).

It is obvious here that it was for the jury to
determine whether a case of aiding and abetting was made out.

But it is contended that the offence committed
by Roméo Rémillard was manslaughter, as shewn by the verdict rendered against
him and which must be taken to have been justified by the evidence, and that
therefore they could not find the appellant guilty of the greater offence, that
of murder.

This reasoning necessarily implies that the
verdict found in another trial against Roméo Rémillard is conclusive evidence
in the trial of Joseph Rémillard of the nature of the offence committed by the
former, of which offence question one assumes that the latter could be found to
have been an aider and abettor. I think that this shews the fallacy of the
appellant's contention, for what was decided in Roméo Rémillard's case was
entirely irrelevant in the trial of his father, and the learned trial judge
would have erred had he told the jury that because the son in another case had
been found guilty of manslaughter, the father, when separately tried, could not
be convicted

[Page 35]

of the greater offence of murder, for that would
have been giving to the verdict in the Roméo Rémillard case a conclusive effect
in the Joseph Rémillard trial; in other words, treating it as res judicata, which
it certainly is not. Unless the provisions of sect. 69 Crim. Code are borne in
mind, confusion may be caused by treating the one as the actual perpetrator,
the other as the aider and abettor, and measuring the guilt of the latter by
the guilt of the former. Both are principals or rather parties to and guilty of
the offence committed (sect. 69), that is to say culpable homicide, and
culpable homicide is murder when committed with intent actual, or presumed in
the cases mentioned in section 259 , subsection (b), (c) and (d), to cause death,
and manslaughter when that intent does not exist. So between two parties,
within the meaning of sect. 69, to a culpable homicide, it is conceivable that
one may be shewn to be guilty of murder and the other of manslaughter. And on
the trial of the appellant, the jury could certainly determine what was the
crime committed and, if the evidence justified the verdict, find the appellant
guilty of murder, notwithstanding the fact that Roméo Rémillard in another
trial was, for the same culpable homicide, convicted of manslaughter.

My opinion therefore is that question one must
be answered in the negative.

Question two. I
would answer both branches of this question in the affirmative. It is common
ground that it was the duty of the learned trial judge to tell the jury that
three verdicts could be rendered upon a charge of murder, to wit, murder,
manslaughter, or acquittal, and the learned judge did so.

[Page 36]

Question three. The
appellant's counsel greatly insisted on this question, contending that the
evidence was such as would have rendered a verdict of manslaughter possible,
and that the jury were not sufficiently instructed as to what constitutes the
offence of manslaughter.

I have twice read the learned judge's charge. He
very particularly explained to the jury the nature of murder, quoting the
different provisions of the code which deal with this crime. There is no
definition in the code of manslaughter, and section 262, stating that culpable
homicide, not amounting to murder, is manslaughter, even if it could be
regarded as a definition, was not read to the jury. However, at different parts
of his charge, while discussing the defences urged by the appellant, the
learned judge referred to manslaughter. Thus, on the defence of provocation,
the learned judge cited section 261 of the code, the effect of which is that
culpable homicide may be reduced to manslaughter where death is caused in the
heat of passion occasioned by a sudden provocation. After reading the first and
second paragraphs of section 261, he said:

Vous vous demanderez si nous sommes dans ce
cas là, et si on a eu le temps de reprendre son sang-froid avant que le coup de
feu ne soit tire.

And after reading the third paragraph of this
section, he adds:

Par conséquent, c'est une question qui doit
être déterminée par vous-mêmes si une action quelconque qui aurait été prouvée
ici, ou une insulte particulière, constitue une provocation, et si la personne
provoquée a réellement perdu son sang-froid par la provocation. Ce sont là des
questions de fait dont vous êtes les seuls maîtres et que vous devez déterminer
après avoir examiné la preuve à la lumière des principes de droit qui vous ont
été exposés.

[Page 37]

Further on, the learned trial judge quoted from
Russell on Crimes, vol. 1, p. 693, translating as follows:—

Pour réduire le crime de meurtre à l'homicide involontaire, la provocation, il faut que les
circonstances justifient la conclusion que l'acte fait avec l'intention de causer la mort ou des blessures corporelles graves,
n'a pas été le résultat d'une décision froidement prise après délibération et
d'une malice réflective, et n'est
imputable qu'à la faiblesse de la nature humaine.

And the learned judge thus commented on this
passage:

Vous vous demanderez si la preuve démontre en
dehors de tout doute que le projet qui a été exécuté entre minuit et une heure
du matin le vingt-huit janvier n'était pas un projet qui avait commencé à se
former et à s'exécuter graduellement depuis la veille au matin.

Vous examinerez les faits et gestes, pas et
démarches de l'accusé à la barre, les déclarations qu'il a faites, vous
examinerez toute sa conduite et vous donnerez la réponse à cette question.

Immediately following the passage I have quoted,
the learned trial judge instructed the jury as to the claim made that the
accused was justified in using force to prevent the breaking into of his house
at night. He said:

L'article 60  du Code Criminel  dit:

Quiconque est en paisible possession d'une
maison d'habitation, et quiconque lui prête légalement main-forte ou agit sous
son autorité, sont justifiables d'employer la force nécessaire pour empêcher
l'effraction de cette maison d'habitation, de nuit, par qui que ce soit, s'il
croit, pour des motifs raisonnables et plausibles, que cette effraction est
tentée dans le but d'y commettre quelque acte criminel.

Est-ce que dans ce cas ici aucune personne a
essayé à commettre une effraction chez l'accusé à la barre?

Est-ce qu'il n'est pas prouvé hors de tout
doute que Morissette aprés avoir dépassé de quelques pieds la maison de Rémillard
en se dirigeant vers chez les Baker, et étant dans le doute que la maison de
Baker fût réellement ce qu'elle était et basant ce doute sur le fait que Baker ne les avait laissés qu'une
demi-heure avant et qu'il n'y avait pas de lumière dans la maison de Baker
puisqu'il y en avait dans la maison de Rémillard, est-ce que, dis-je, il y a eu
effraction de la part de Morissette?

[Page 38]

N'est-il pas vrai que Morissette a fait comme
tout homme bien élevé qui arrive dans une maison respectable; qu'il a sonné à
la porte avant d'entrer? Est-ce qu'il n'est pas prouvé qu'il a enlevé son
chapeau et qu'il a posé poliment une question à la personne qui lui ouvrait la
porte?

Again the learned judge, referring to the
suggestion of the defence that the prisoner's wife was a prostitute and that
the deceased and his companions had come to the prisoner's house at night in
order to commit adultery with her, quoted from some unnamed authority as
follows :

Si un homme en trouve un autre commettant
l'adultère et le tue ou le tire dans le premier transport de sa passion, il
n'est coupable que d'homicide involontaire, car la provocation est grave et la
loi présume que le mari n'a pu se contrôler. Mais celui qui tue l'adultère
délibérément et par vengeance est coupable de meurtre. Ainsi, si un père voit
quelqu'un commettre avec son fils un acte contre nature et le tue
instantanément ce ne sera qu'un homicide involontaire. Mais s'il en entend
parler seulement, recherche ensuite cette personne et la tue, ayant eu le temps
de reprendre ses sens, ce sera un meurtre.

And as to the claim made that the accused had
acted in self defence, the learned judge said:

Si une personne recevant un coup se revenge
immédiatement avec une arme ou autre instrument qui lui tombe sous la main,
l'offense ne sera qu'homicide involontaire, pourvu que le coup ait été porté
sous le coup de la colère résultant de la provocation, car la colère est une
passion à laquelle sont sujets les bons comme les méchants. Mais la loi exige
deux choses:

1°. Qu'il y ait eu provocation;
2°, que le coup puisse clairement
être attribué à l'influence de la passion résultant de la provocation.

Y a-t-il eu assaut dans le cas actuel?

Le coup a-t-il été tiré sous le coup de la
colère, colère provoquée par cet assaut, le tout à la connaissance de l'accusé
en cette cause?

Si vous en arrivez à la conclusion que ce
drame s'est déroulé sous l'influence soudaine de la passion, vous devrez
appliquer la loi que je viens de vous exposer, mais si vous en arrivez à la
conclusion que l'accusé d'abord a fait quelques actes d'omission ou de
commission conformément aux principes de la loi que je viens de vous citer, et
qu'il a agi ou refusé d'agir sans être sous l'influence soudaine de la passion,
mais bien sous l'influence de cette disposition dépravée et de ce mauvais
esprit que la loi nomme ""malice"" dans la définition du meurtre, alors
l'offense ne sera pas l'homicide involontaire mais ce sera le meurtre.

[Page 39]

In view of all this I cannot come to the
conclusion that the learned trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury
as to what in law constitutes the offence of manslaughter, at least in so far
as was necessary to decide upon the different defences relied on by the
accused, and as to these defences the learned judge told the jury under what
circumstances, if they thought them established, a verdict of manslaughter
could be returned. Such a method of instruction was probably more useful to the
jury than citing to them sect. 262 of the Criminal Code , or theoretically
explaining the differences between murder and manslaughter. The charge as a
whole was a strong one against the prisoner and may have given the jury the
impression that the proper verdict to return was a verdict of murder, while
leaving them entirely free to appreciate the evidence and come to their own
conclusions thereon. Even if I thought that this amounts to misdirection, and I
cannot say that, I would not be justified in setting aside the verdict unless I
felt convinced that some substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned by the
judge's charge (sect. 1019 Criminal Code ). I cannot come to this conclusion
after carefully reading the learned judge's charge and the circumstances there
referred to as far as disclosed, and if the learned trial judge's comments on
the facts are fair, and no objection thereto was taken at the trial, my opinion
is that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned, even if the
impression was left on the minds of the members of the jury that the proper
verdict to return was one of guilty of murder.

I would therefore answer both branches of
question three in the affirmative.

As a result the appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPEAL DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.

Criminal law—Trial—Plea of insanity—Charge
to jury—Proof—Beyond a reasonable doubt.

On a criminal trial where the prisoner pleads
insanity it is misdirection for the judge to charge the jury that insanity must
be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rex v. Anderson (7 Alta. L.R. 102) approved. The
King v. Kierstead (45 N.B. Rep. 553) overruled. Idington J.
dissents.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the conviction of the
appellant on an indictment for murder.

The appellant being put on trial pleaded that
he was insane when the crime was committed. Subject to this defence the crime
was proved.

The trial judge in charging the jury
instructed them that the onus of proving insanity was on the prisoner and that
such defence must be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" The
appeal Division having already decided in 1818 in The King v. Kierstead[1] that this was a proper
charge the trial judge refused an application for a reserved case based on it
as a misdirection and the Appeal Division refused to direct that he should
grant it.

[Page 609]

In a case of Rex v. Anderson[2], the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta had, in 1814, held that such a charge was
misdirection arid the prisoner applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada under the provisions of the amendment of the Criminal Code  passed in
1920 being 10-11 Geo. V, ch. 43, sec. 16. This amendment authorizes a judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal to that Court where
provincial courts have given conflicting decisions on a question of criminal
law. The leave was granted in this case the effect of which was that the judge
granting it held that it can be granted where the court below is unanimous (if
not the amendment would be unnecessary, as if there is dissent in the court
below an appeal would lie as of right) and also that the refusal of the
provincial court to direct the trial judge to reserve a case is an affirmance
of the conviction under sec. 1024  C.C.

W. P. Jones K.C. for the appellant.

W. B. Wallace K.C. for the respondent
referred to Rex v. Beard[3].

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was indicted for murder and convicted
thereof. The defence set up was insanity. The facts bearing upon his actual
commission of the crime charged seem to have been of such a conclusive
character as to leave no room for doubt of his guilt unless he could be excused
on the ground of insanity, or rather a doubt of his sanity which is sought to
serve the same purpose.

[Page 610]

Stripped of undue verbiage confusing or tending
to confuse the mind, the issue raised is whether or not if there might have
been or ought to have been created by the evidence adduced a doubt as to his
sanity in the minds of the jurors who tried him, then he should have been
acquitted.

The law in Canada ever since the enactment of
the Criminal Code  of 1892, is that declared by section 11  thereof continued in
section 19  of the Criminal Code , chapter 146 of the Revised Statutes of Canada
1906, as follows:—

19. No person shall be convicted of an
offence by reason of an act done or omitted by him when labouring under natural
imbecility, or disease of the mind, to such an extent as to render him incapable
of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission, and of knowing
that such an act or omission was wrong.

2. A person labouring under specific
delusions, but in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of
insanity, under the provisions hereinafter contained, unless the delusions
caused him to believe in the existence of some state of things which, if it
existed, would justify or excuse his act or omission.

3. Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

In submitting the question of appellant's sanity
to the jury, the learned trial judge told them that the burden was placed upon
the accused to make out his insanity at the' time of the commission of the
offence, beyond a reasonable doubt.

Inasmuch as that precise form of direction had
been then recently, unanimously approved by the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick in the case of The King v.
Kierstead[4],
the learned trial judge refused to reserve a case for said court, founded upon
the objection that there was error in so charging the jury. That court upon
appeal thereto decided to abide by its ruling in said case and refused to
interfere.

[Page 611]

The Court of Appeal for Alberta in a similar
case of The King v. Anderson[5],
having, in 1914, by a bare majority decided that a charge using similar
language to that now in question, was erroneous and granted a new trial, the
appellant obtained from my brother Anglin leave to appeal to this court, under
and by virtue of chapter 43, section 16, of the Dominion Statutes of 1920,
which provides as follows:—

16. The following section is inserted
immediately after section one thousand and twenty-four of the said Act:

1024a. Either the Attorney-General of the
province or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside
or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence, if the judgment appealed
from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case,

and continues to provide for a judge of this
court giving in such case leave to appeal.

It has been argued before us not only that there
is a substantial conflict between the judgment in question and that in the Anderson
Case5, but also that the ruling of the
Supreme Court of the United States in Davis v. United States[6], is the correct view to adopt.

The head note to that report is as follows:—

If it appears on the trial of a person
accused of committing the crime of murder, that the deceased was killed by the
accused under circumstances which—nothing else appearing—made a case of murder,
the jury cannot properly return a verdict of guilty of the offence charged if,
upon the whole evidence, from whichever side it comes, they have a reasonable
doubt whether, at the time of killing, the accused was mentally competent to
distinguish between right and wrong, or to understand the nature of the act he
was committing.

No man should be deprived of his life under
the forms of law unless the jurors who try him are able, upon their
consciences, to say that the evidence before them, by whomsoever adduced, is
sufficient to shew beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact
necessary to constitute the crime charged.

[Page 612]

Such is the result of an argument in which about
a hundred authorities were cited, and many of them are referred to in the
judgment of the court.

Such is, as it seems to me, the drift and
probable result of accepting the law as laid down in the Anderson Case[7], in preference to that
by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal.

The grave consequences of our so deciding would
be almost tantamount to repealing the above quoted enactment of our Code,
obviously designed to put an end to what was presumably an undesirable state of
our law as administered, and place it upon clear and, but for what has
happened, I should have supposed unmistakable grounds.

In the Anderson Case7, Mr.
Justice Stuart was, I respectfully submit, apparently unable to define the
difference between a defence to the ""satisfaction of the jury"" or
""dearly proven"" and one ""beyond reasonable doubt.""

And, with great respect, I cannot see how, for a
moment, the protection thrown around a prisoner is, as he suggests, necessarily
interfered with by the due limitation of the defence set up.

Mr. Justice Beck cited therein as authority
Cyc's definition which tends in same direction as ultimately decided in the Davis
Case[8]
I refer to above.

None of the other authorities which he cites, to
my mind, I respectfully submit, when closely examined and considered, really
touch the kernel of what is involved herein.

On the other hand such decisions as Chief
Justice Harvey relies upon, aptly present the identical view he took of the
Anderson case, as that which had been

[Page 613]

presented by eminent judges in England, using the phrase ""beyond
reasonable doubt"" in the same sense in relation to the proof of insanity
as did the learned trial judge in that case.

He cited Bellingham's Case, decided in
1812; referred to in Russell on Crimes (7th ed.) at page 65; Reg. v. Stokes[9], decided in 1848, only
five years after McNaghten's Case[10],
by Baron Rolfe, who had been appointed to the Exchequer Chamber in 1839 and
hence possibly one of the judges called to answer the question in the McNaghten
Case10, and (though best known as a leader of
the Chancery Bar) had had considerable experience in criminal trials as
recorder of Bury St. Edmunds, and in presiding at the trial of many notable
criminal cases; and the case of Rex v. Jefferson[11], where Mr. Justice
Bigham, as late as 1908, charged the jury in the same terms as now objected to.

And although that case went to appeal no one
ever thought of raising such a ground as now taken herein. Why so unless
clearly untenable?

The truth would seem to be that the law as laid
down in the McNaghten Case10, that in order to establish the
defence, on the ground of insanity, it must be ""clearly proven"" and
that ""to the satisfaction of the jury"" has always been, for at least
a hundred years the law in England; and that it has been so presented to juries
concerned in the language now complained of without challenge.

Mr. Tremear, in the second edition of his work
on our code, in his notes upon the section thereof now in question, says that
it was in the draft code prepared by the Imperial Commission, but never adopted
by parliament.

[Page 614]

Law seemingly was found to be more stabilized,
as it were; in England without a code, than in some other countries with one.

That, however, is no reason for our departing
from our criminal code which seems to me in its terms to be more imperatively
adverse to the appellants contention in its terms than the logical result of
the judicially made law of England.

The word ""satisfaction"" has given to
it, in Murray's Dictionary, as
one of its many meanings, the following :

6. Release from suspense, uncertainty, or
uneasiness (J.); information that answers a person's demands or needs, removal
of doubt, conviction.

Phrase, to (a person's) satisfaction.

I am unable to find the thing proved, as our
Code so expressly requires, unless it is so beyond reasonable doubt. I should
dislike very much to hold any man proved insane, either in a civil or criminal
proceeding. unless I could do so beyond reasonable doubt.

And I venture to think that the safety and
protection of society is just as important as is the protection of a member
thereof, when that member is placed upon trial. On the one hand he or she has
been most justly protected for ages by the use of a judicial formula, as it
were, lest passion and prejudice should prevail and injustice
be done.

And in relation to the defence of insanity,
those who have given thought to the matter at all, must realize how easy it has
been and still is to abuse the defence by suggestions, for example, of
temporary insanity, and mislead those moved by pity or passion, to the
deterioration of the due administration of justice.

I respectfully submit that society as a whole is
quite as much entitled to be protected as a single member thereof. Such
illustrations as proof of an

[Page 615]

alibi, which forms part of the evidence of the
actual facts pro and con, bearing upon the issue raised relative to the actual
perpetration of the offence in question, are quite beside the collateral
substantive issue of mental and moral responsibility.

That is only permitted to be raised as a defence
in law to the actual commission of the offence when rebutting the presumption
of sanity declared by said section until the insanity is proved.

The charge against an accused person should in
regard to the acceptance of and weight to be given the evidence of fact for or
against him or her so far as bearing upon the actual offence charged, be kept
clearly and distinctly severable from the defence of insanity, and each of the
issues thus raised be given its own proper place in the presentation thereof,
made by the judge's charge, or otherwise.

It must be determined first whether or not upon
the evidence bearing upon the actual perpetration of the offence, the accused
can be found ""beyond reasonable doubt"" guilty, and then due
consideration be given to the alternative of whether or not at the time in
question the accused was of sound mind within the meaning of the statute and
that finding must be subject to the like limitations of proof ""beyond
reasonable doubt.""

The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

Duff J.—On the trial of an accused person indicted for murder where the
defence of insanity is set up, it is incumbent upon the accused in order to
negative his responsibility for an act otherwise criminal to prove to the
satisfaction of the jury that he was insane at the time he committed the act. Mcnaghten's
Case[12],

[Page 616]

and Criminal Code , section 19 , subsec. 3. The
trial judge told the jury that they ought to convict the prisoner unless the
defence of insanity was established by the prisoner beyond a reasonable doubt,
and he added:

If you entertain any reasonable doubts as
to the sanity of the prisoner at the time he committed the act, why then it is
your duty to convict.

This direction was, in my opinion, an erroneous
one and calculated to mislead the jury.

Broadly speaking, in civil proceedings the
burden of proof being upon a party to establish a given allegation of fact, the
party on whom the burden lies is not called upon to establish his allegation in
a fashion so rigorous as to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the tribunal
with whom the decision rests. It is, generally speaking, sufficient if he has
produced such a preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he
seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the possible views of
the facts. This proposition is referred to by Mr. Justice Willes in Cooper v.
Slade[13],
in these words:

The elementary proposition that in civil
cases the preponderance of probability may constitute sufficient ground for the
verdict.

The distinction in this respect between civil
and criminal cases is fully explained in a judgment of Mr. Justice Patteson
speaking for the Judicial Committee in the case of Doe d. Devine v. Wilson[14], The whole passage is
so instructive and so apt that it is worth while reproducing it in full:—

Now, there is a great distinction between a
civil and a criminal case, when a question of forgery arises. In a civil case
the onus of proving the genuineness of a deed is cast upon the party who
pro-

[Page 617]

duces it, and asserts its validity. If
there be conflicting evidence as to the genuineness, either by reason of
alleged forgery, or otherwise, the party asserting the deed must satisfy the
jury that it is genuine. The jury must weigh the conflicting evidence, consider
all the probabilities of the case, not excluding the ordinary presumption of
innocence, and must determine the question according to the balance of those
probabilities. In a criminal case the onus of proving the forgery is
cast on the prosecutor who asserts it, and unless he can satisfy the jury that
the instrument is forged to the exclusion of reasonable doubt, the prisoner
must be acquitted.

Now, the charge of the learned judge
appears to their Lordships to have in effect shifted the onus from the
defendants, who assert the deed, to the plaintiff, who denies it, for in
substance he tells the jury that whatever be the balance of the probabilities,
yet, if they have a reasonable doubt the defendants are to have the benefit of
that doubt, and the deed is to be established even against the probabilities in
favour of the doubt. Certainly, it has been the practice so to direct the jury
in a criminal case; whether on motives of public policy or from tenderness to
life and liberty, or from any other reason, it may not be material to inquire,
but none of those reasons apply to a cicil case. If, indeed, by the pleadings
in a civil case, a direct issue of forgery or not, be raised, the onus
would lie on the party asserting the forgery, and this would be more like a
criminal proceeding, but even then the reasons for suffering a doubt to prevail
against the probabilities, would not, in their Lordships' opinion, apply.

This exposition of the distinction between the
two classes of cases brings out the point that the rule in criminal cases is a
rule based upon policy.

The distinction may be illustrated by reference
to another class of proceedings in which a similar rule applies, namely,
proceedings to establish illegitimacy and proceedings in which the validity of
a de facto marriage is called in question. Where a child is born of a
married mother and husband and wife have had access during the relevant period
the presumption of legitimacy is of such a character that it can only be
overcome by evidence producing in the mind of the tribunal a moral certainty.
And this moral certainty is contrasted by Lord Lyndhurst in a celebrated
passage in Morris v. Davies[15],
with a conclusion

[Page 618]

reached by weighing the probabilities and
resting upon a mere balance of probabilities. The like rule prevails where a
marriage having been solemnized, there have been cohabitation and issue and a
question arises as to whether the marriage ceremony was formally sufficient. In
such a case it is incumbent upon those who impeach the validity of the marriage
to demonstrate the existence of the defect.

All this is sometimes expressed by saying that
the law presumes innocence and legitimacy but in truth the fact that in given
circumstances there is a rebuttable presumption of law in favour of a certain
conclusion does not necessarily afford any guide as to the weight or strength
of the evidence required to rebut the presumption. The law presumes for example
that a promissory note is given for a valuable consideration; a presumption
which has only the effect of establishing a prima facie case. The law
presumes innocence but it prescribes also a supplementary rule, namely, that in
criminal proceedings, at all events, the presumption of innocence is not
rebutted unless the evidence offered for that purpose demonstrates guilt in the
sense of excluding to a moral certainty all hypotheses (not in themselves
improbable) inconsistent with guilt.

The precise question to be determined is whether
the same rule governs where the presumption to be overcome is a presumption of
sanity. Where the question arises on a criminal prosecution the practice has
been to treat the presumption as a presumption of law and this practice seems
to be sanctioned both by the answers given by the judges in Mcnaghten's Case[16] and by the provision
of the Criminal Code  of Canada

[Page 619]

above referred to; but as I have just pointed
out the circumstance that the presumption is a presumption of law tells us
nothing as to the weight of the proof required to overcome it. Is there a
special rule as to this?

I am unable to think of any principle or any
reason of policy comparable in importance to those upon which rest the rules
touching the presumptions of innocence and legitimacy for holding that a
similar rule should be applied as touching the character of the proof to be
exacted where the presumption to be overcome is the presumption of sanity; or
why the general principle should not be adhered to that in judicial proceedings
conclusions of fact may legitimately be founded upon a substantial
preponderance of evidence.

I have moreover no doubt that the expressions
which have for generations been used by judges in instructing juries in
criminal proceedings as to the degree of certainty justifying a conviction (as
""the prisoner must be given the benefit of the doubt,"" ""guilt
must be established to the exclusion of reasonable doubt""), are
expressions which have passed into common speech; and that a Canadian jury
receiving instructions couched in similar terms as to the probative weight of
the evidence necessary to justify a given conclusion would in the great
majority of cases attach to these expressions the significance which they
ordinarily bear and are intended to bear when used in relation to the
presumption of innocence. A jury being instructed that a finding of insanity
would only be proper if they should be satisfied to the exclusion of all
reasonable doubt upon that point, would not, I am quite sure, understand that
an affirmative conclusion would be justified by proof consisting only of a
substantial preponderance in the weight of evidence.

[Page 620]

It will be necessary to refer very briefly to
some authorities that have been mentioned. And first of the charge of Mansfield
C. J. in Bellingham's Case, which is said to have been approved by Lord
Lyndhurst C. B. in The Queen v. Oxford[17]. The report of Sir
James Mansfield's charge seems to be a newspaper report only, and Lord
Lyndhurst's words of approval seem to be rather directed to the Chief Justice's
definition of insanity than to his remarks upon the burden of proof. Lord
Lyndhurst indeed in Oxford's Case17, contents himself with
stating that the jury must be satisfied that the prisoner was insane before
they can properly acquit him. Bellinghams's Case was a very painful case
and I do not think it can be regarded as a satisfactory authority upon this
point. See The Queen v. Oxford17; The Queen v. McNaughton[18], and especially the
speech of Mr. Cockburn. In Oxford's Case17, just
referred to, Lord Denman C.J., who with Alderson B. and Patteson J. presided,
limited himself to remarking as regards the burden of proof that all persons ""prima
facie must be taken to be of sound mind till the contrary is shewn.""
In similar terms the jury was charged in The Queen v. Vaughan[19]; Reg. v. Higginson[20]; Reg. v. Davies[21]; Reg. v. Barton[22]; Reg. v. Townley[23]; Reg. v. Layton[24].

It is quite true that in Reg. v. Stokes[25], Rolfe B. is reported
to have said that if the jury were left in doubt it would be their duty to
convict, and similar language is attributed to Bingham J. in Rex. v. Jefferson[26]. When the remarks of these learned judges are

[Page 621]

read as a whole, however, the fair
interpretation of them seems to be that the jury must be satisfied with the
evidence of insanity. They were not, I think, intended to convey to the jury
the impression that they must arrive at that degree of moral certainty which is
necessary to justify a conviction upon a charge of crime. As against these
observations may be put the language of Tindal C. J. in addressing the jury in McNaughton's
Case[27],
where he presided with Williams J. and Coleridge J. The learned Chief Justice
used these words:—

If on balancing the evidence in your minds
you think the prisoner capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, then
he was a responsible agent and liable to all the penalties the law imposes. If
not so, and if in your judgment the subject should appear involved in very
great difficulty, then you will probably not take upon yourselves to find the
prisoner guilty. If that is your opinion, then you will acquit the prisoner.

It seems clear that there has been no uniform
practice of directing the jury on the issue of insanity in the manner adopted
by the trial judge in this case and as it appears, as I have said, to be more
consistent with principle that the jury should be told that insanity must be
clearly proved to their satisfaction but that they are at liberty to find the
issue in the affirmative if satisfied that there is a substantial, that is to
say, a clear preponderance of evidence, I am constrained to the conclusion that
there was substantial error in the conduct of the trial and that a new trial
should be directed.

Anglin J.—Is it misdirection to instruct a jury that to justify a verdict
of acquittal on that ground (sec. 966 Crim. Code) in a prosecution for murder
the defence of insanity must be established beyond a

[Page 622]

reasonable doubt? The Supreme Court of Alberta
en banc (Harvey C. J. dissenting), held that it was in Rex v. Anderson[28]. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
following its own previous judgment in The King v. Kierstead[29], has unanimously held
in this case that it is not. Hence this appeal—the first brought to this court
under section 1024  (a) of the Criminal Code , enacted by 10-11 Geo. V., c. 43,
s. 16.

If this question were entirely open, I should be
disposed to accept as more logical and humane than that approved in English law
(however defensible the latter may be on grounds of policy) the view which has
prevailed in the Supreme Court of the United States and in many states of the
Union (Lawson on Presumptive Evidence, p. 537; 16 C.J., 775) that, while the
presumption of sanity relieves the prosecutor in the first instance from
proving that fact, if, upon the whole evidence, a reasonable doubt remains in
the mind of the jury whether at the time of the killing the accused was
mentally competent to distinguish between right and wrong or to understand the
nature of his act, it cannot properly render a verdict of guilty. Davis v.
United States[30];
German v. United States[31]. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Harlan, delivering the judgment of
the court in the Davis Case30, seems to me unanswerable. How can a
man rightly be adjudged guilty of a crime

if upon all the evidence there is
reasonable doubt whether in law he was capable of committing crime? (P. 484).

***

How upon principle or consistently with
humanity, can a verdict of guilty be properly returned if the jury entertain a
reasonable doubt as to the existence of a fact which is essential to guilt,
viz., the capacity in law of the accused to commit that crime ? (P. 488).

[Page 623]

Where, as in murder, intent is an essential
element in the crime, if the evidence as a whole so far rebuts the presumption
of intent that it is left doubtful whether the accused was capable of forming
the necessary intent—could have had mens rea—how can it be held that all
the constituent elements of criminality are established beyond reasonable
doubt? Professor Thayer in his excellent Treatise on the Law of Evidence (1
ed., pp. 381-4) discusses this question with his customary lucidity.

The defence of insanity, which goes to negative
an essential ingredient of the crime—criminal intent—just as does the defence
of inevitable accident—and as the defence of an alibi goes to negative another
essential element, the identity of the accused—is thus put on the same footing
as other defences. Evidence in support of them which creates in the minds of
the jury a doubt whether some essential element of the crime has been
established—a doubt which on the whole evidence is not removed—entitles the
accused to an acquittal, since the burden of satisfying the jury of his guilt
beyond reasonable doubt, which always rests on the prosecutor and never
changes, has not been discharged. Rex. v. Schama[32]; Rex. v. Stoddart[33]; Rex. v. Myshrall[34].

But this is not the law of England with regard
to the defence of insanity as is stated by the judges in their answers to questions
propounded to them by the House of Lords in McNaghten's Case[35], which,
notwithstanding criticism by eminent judges and writers, have ever since been
generally accepted in English courts as authoritative. It does not suffice in

[Page 624]

English law that a defendant pleading insanity
should create a doubt as to his sanity in the minds of the jury. He must prove
his irresponsibility ""to their satisfaction""—it must be ""clearly
proved."" So said Lord Chief Justice Tindal, speaking for himself and his
fellow judges.

As the learned Chief Justice of Alberta says[36] the authority of McNaghten's Case[37] not having been
accepted in the United States

a reference to American text writers and
cases can furnish no aid in determining the law in Canada on this subject.

On the other hand our Parliament has seen fit in
s. 19 (3)  of the Criminal Code  to define the law which is to govern Canadian
courts in these terms:—

Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

It is noteworthy that, although the codifiers
undoubtedly had the language of McNaghten's Case37 before
them, our legislators have not said that, in order to overcome the presumption
of sanity, mental irresponsibility must be ""clearly proved"" or even
that it must be ""established to the satisfaction of the jury""—but
merely that it must be ""proved.""

Another point of difference between our
statutory law and that of England, perhaps not devoid of significance, is that
whereas here on insanity being ""proved"" the verdict is to be
""not guilty"", (the jury being required to find the insanity specially
and, if that be the case, to state that the acquittal is on account of it s.
966), thus indicating that insanity with us goes to the question of guilt or
innocence, in England since 1883 (46-47 Vic., c. 38) in like circumstances the
verdict must be guilty of the act or omission

[Page 625]

charged but insane at the time when he did the
act or made the omission, thus indicating that insanity is there not an
absolute defence but rather matter available in arrest of judgment. This would
seem to be a logical outcome of the view that, notwithstanding reasonable doubt
as to sanity raised by the evidence, criminality involving intent may exist
beyond reasonable doubt.

No doubt, however, ""proved"" in
subsection 3 of section 19 of our Code must mean ""proved to the
satisfaction of the jury,"" which, in turn, means to its reasonable
satisfaction. Braunstein v. Accidental Death Ins. Co.[38]. It may possibly have
been meant to cover the phrase ""clearly proved"" used in McNaghten's
Case[39].
""Clear and positive proof,"" however, was held in an Indian case cited
in Stroud's Jud. Dict. (2 ed.), 323, (the report is not available here) to mean
""such evidence as leaves no reasonable doubt."" If the adverb
""clearly"" adds to the force of the participle ""proved"" its
use, in my opinion, is not warranted under our Code. Still less is it
justifiable to add to the ""proved"" of the Code such a distinctly
qualifying phrase as ""beyond all reasonable doubt,"" if a higher
degree of certainty is thereby required than the word ""proved"" itself
imports.

""Proved"" is not a word of art. Aaron's
Reefs v. Twiss[40].
It may have different shades of meaning varying according to the subject matter
in connection with, and the context in which, it is used. ""Tested"" or
""made good"" or ""established"" are its ordinary equivalents. Murray's Dict. Crampton v. Swete[41]; It may require only
evidence of the factum probandum

[Page 626]

sufficient to be left to a jury. Tatam v.
Haslar[42];
see too The People v. Winters[43].
Here I find nothing to warrant requiring evidence of greater weight than would
ordinarily satisfy a jury in a civil case that a burden of proof had been
discharged—that, balancing the probabilities upon the whole case, there was such
a preponderance of evidence as would warrant them as reasonable men in
concluding that it had been established that the accused when he committed the
act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality, or if he did know
it, did not know that he was doing what was wrong. That I believe to be the law
of Canada, as it appears to be
that of most of the states of the American Union. Undérhill on Criminal
Evidence, s. 158.

The latter clause of the ancient maxim, stabit
praesumptio donec probetur in contrarium, does not import that any special
amount or degree of evidence is required to rebut the presumption. Its whole
office is to shift to him against whom it operates the burden of adducing such
evidence as will satisfy the tribunal that the presumption should not prevail
(Best on Evidence, 11 ed., p. 314), such proof as may render the view which he
supports reasonably probable. To require that a particular presumption must be
negatived beyond reasonable doubt is to super-add to the force of the presumption
a rule of substantive law—and that has been done in the case of the presumption
of innocence. Thayer, Law of Evidence, 1st ed., pages 336 and 384. The history
of this presumption of law and the distinction between it and the doctrine of
reasonable doubt is dealt with by Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) White in Coffin
v. United States[44], at pages 452-60.

[Page 627]

I quite appreciate the difficulty experienced by
Harvey C. J.[45], and
by White J.[46], in
formulating the distinction between proof to the satisfaction of the jury and
proof beyond reasonable doubt. How can I be satisfied of a fact if I have
reasonable doubt that it is so? But, with Mr. Justice Beck, (p. 117) I am
convinced that the expression ""proved beyond reasonable doubt"" has
become consecrated by long judicial usage as pointing to an amount or degree of
proof greater than is imported by the word ""proved"" standing alone or
by the expression ""established to the satisfaction of the jury,"" or
even by ""clearly proved""—certainly greater than is required to
discharge the burden of proof in civil matters. That learned judge quotes an
extract from the judgment delivered by Sir John Patteson in Doe d. Devine v.
Wilson[47], at page 531, and a passage from Taylor on Evidence (par. 112) as illustrating this difference. But the
actuality of the distinction in law between an instruction that the existence
of a fact or condition must be proved and that it must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt is perhaps best tested by the inquiry whether an accused would
not have ground for complaint if the trial judge having charged that the jury
must be satisfied of his guilt—that it is clearly proven—should refuse to
direct them that they must be so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. I put that
question to counsel for the Crown during the argument. It was not answered. I
find it was anticipated by Mr. Justice Stuart in Andersons's case (pp. 113-4). With that learned judge

I think the rule is well established that
an accused person is entitled to have such a direction given,

[Page 628]

accompanied by an explanation of what is
reasonable doubt. Rex. v. Stoddart[48];
Rex. v. Schama[49];
Reg. v. White[50],
are instances of the recognition of this right in English law. In R. v. Sterne,
cited in Best on Evidence (11 ed.) 84, Baron Parke instructed that there
should be

such moral certainty as convinces the mind
of the tribunal as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable doubt.

I also agree with Mr. Justice Stuart that

if the expression (beyond reasonable doubt)
was not improper in the present case, then it inevitably follows that it is not
necessary in the ordinary case,

i.e., in directing the jury as to the burden of
the prosecution.

The case of Reg. v. Layton[51], in which the trial took place shortly after McNaghten's Case[52], where the direction
given by Rolfe B. was

the question therefore for the jury would
be not whether the prisoner was of sound mind but whether he had made out to
their satisfaction that he was not of sound mind,

may perhaps be referred to as an instance of a
correct appreciation of the effect of the McNaghten Case. Lord Lyndhurst had
delivered a similar charge in Rex v. Offord[53]. The charge of Bigham
J. in R. v. Jefferson[54],
that the prisoner has to make out the charge of insanity

to your satisfaction without any reasonable
doubt; if you have reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was doing wrong or
not you must find him guilty.

though similar to that in Bellingham's Case, as
noted in53, and to that in. R. v. Stokes[55], was, I venture to

[Page 629]

think, a misapprehension of the effect of the
answer of the judges in the House of Lords. Such a charge, would, in my
opinion, be clearly wrong in Canada. These Nisi Prius reports, however, are really of little
value.

On appeal in Jefferson's Case[56], Lawrence J.,
delivering the opinion of the court setting aside the verdict on another
ground, was careful to state that no question had been raised as to the
direction of the trial judge (p. 470), probably to make it clear that approval
of it was not to be inferred.

I am, for these reasons, of the opinion that
there was misdirection at the trial of the appellant and that it is not
possible to say that substantial wrong did not result therefrom. The
application of the appellant for leave to appeal should, therefore, be granted
and his conviction set aside and a new trial directed.

Brodeur J.—I concur with my brother Duff.

Mignault J.—A presumption being, by definition, a deduction from a known or
ascertained fact, or, as the old writers expressed it, ex eo quod plerumque
fit, it is clear that the presumption of sanity of mind, entailing civil
and criminal responsibility, would be fully recognized even if it had not been
made the subject of a statutory declaration. So paragraph 3  of section 19  of
the Criminal Code , which states that

every one shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved,

merely gives an unnecessary, I do not say a
useless, legislative sanction to a universally recognized presumption of fact,
entitling us to consider it as a

[Page 630]

presumption of law—although that does not add to
its evidential force—which will stand as proof of the basic element of criminal
responsibility, until it is rebutted or, to use the words of the Code,
""until the contrary is proved.""

This shews that although we have an express
declaration by the legislature, the Code really adds nothing to the common law;
in fact the presumption of sanity of mind, involving criminal responsibility,
is recognized in England as well as in all countries, and our inquiries need
not carry us further, which are subject to the common law.

We may, therefore, take the rule stated by the
judges in McNaghten's Case[57],
that the jurors should be told that every man is presumed to be sane until the
contrary is proved to their satisfaction, (I do not here refer to the further
statement of the judges, speaking by Tindal C. J., that insanity must be
""clearly proved"") as being in effect the rule of our criminal code,
for although the words ""to the satisfaction of the jury"" are not
contained in paragraph 3  of section 19 , inasmuch as the contrary of the
presumption must be proved, and the proof must be passed on by the jury, this
proof must be sufficient to satisfy the jury that the presumption has been
rebutted.

I do not think that it is necessary to consider
cases that have been decided in the United States, although I have read with
interest and with some measure of sympathetic consideration the able opinion of
the late Mr. Justice Harlan in Davis v. United States[58], to the effect that if
on the whole evidence any reasonable doubt exists as to the sanity of the
accused the jury should acquit. This manifestly would transgress the

[Page 631]

rule of our Code, for instead of proving his
insanity, it would be sufficient for the accused to create in the minds of the
jury a reasonable doubt whether he was sane when he committed the crime, which
would, in my judgment, deprive the legal presumption of its legitimate effect.

Here the learned trial judge in charging the
jury emphasized that it was their duty to convict the accused unless in their
opinion he had proved his insanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Is this
misdirection in law? The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, whose judgment in the
case of The King v. Kierstead[59],
the learned trial judge followed, has unanimously held that it was not.
Inasmuch, however, as the Appellate Division of Alberta, in Rex v. Anderson[60], had decided that such a direction was wrong, the appellant was
enabled to appeal to this court by reason of a recent amendment of the Criminal
Code  10-11 Geo. V., ch. 43, sec. 16.

My first impression at the hearing was that if
the jury entertained a reasonable doubt whether the plea of insanity was
proved, the legal presumption was not rebutted. Further reflection has,
however, led me to think that it is sufficient that the jury be satisfied on
all the evidence that the plea of insanity has been established, and for that
reason I fear that the direction which was given in this case may have been, to
say the least, misleading. It is, moreover, open to the objection that
something is added to the law, which is content with requiring that the
contrary be proved, without specifying the degree of proof to be adduced. It is
unquestionable that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so that the
presumption of innocence is stronger, and rightly so, than the presumption of
sanity. Proof in ordinary matters does not suppose

[Page 632]

that the evidence removes all doubt; it is the
result of a preponderance of evidence, or of the acceptance on reasonable
grounds of one probability in preference to another, and, in the case of
insanity, the evidence generally is largely a matter of expert opinion. To say
that insanity must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury does not weaken
the legal presumption, but it places the plea of insanity on the same footing
as all other defences which must be established so as to satisfy the jury. I
would certainly not say that if the jury be in doubt whether the accused was
sane or insane they should acquit him, because, if they accept his plea of
insanity, they must expressly find that he was insane and return a verdict of
not guilty because of insanity (sect. 966 Crim. Code). But while unquestionably
all the onus here is on the accused, still the jury may accept his evidence as
having greater weight than that of the Crown, although they might not feel that
all reasonable doubt has been removed. Such a doubt might be caused by the
testimony of one reputable expert against the opinion of other experts, and, in
such a case, it is certainly within the province of the jury to accept the
views of the latter in preference to those of the former. I would therefore
think that a proper direction would be to call the attention of the jury to the
legal presumption of sanity and to inform them, the onus being on the accused,
that insanity must be proved by him to their satisfaction. Further than that I
would not go.

A serious wrong or miscarriage may have resulted
from the direction given by the learned trial judge, so on full consideration I
concur in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Seduction—Evidence—Indecent assault—Damages.
Sec. 13 Cr. C.

In an action framed for damages for indecent
assault, although the plaintiff's evidence of force and want of consent on her
part is discredited, the court can, nevertheless, accept her evidence that the
defendant is the father of the child and find that there was seduction. Cassels
J. dissenting.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal (14 Sask.
L.R. 117) reversed, Cassels J. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the
judgment of Taylor J. at the trial1, and dismissing the appellant's action.

This action is one for damages by the
appellant against the respondent alleging that the latter did carnally know her
against her will, whereby she became pregnant. The appellant testified that she
did not consent to the intercourse with the respondent. The trial judge
disbelieved this evidence, but found that she had been seduced by the
respondent and that the defendant was the father of her child, and he allowed
her $2,500 damages. The Court of Appeal

[Page 518]

held that, as the appellant's evidence of
force and want of consent on her part was discredited, and as there was no
other evidence than appellant's that she had been seduced, the respondent
denying any connection at all, the court could not find that there was
seduction.

W. S. Gray for the appellant. It was open to the trial judge to accept the
appellant's evidence in part and reject it in part. E. v. F.[2]; Brown v. Dalby[3].

H. Fisher for respondent. The appellant failed to prove her action as brought
for criminal assault. The appellant on the evidence is not entitled to a
judgment for damages for seduction. Gibson v. Rabey[4].

W. S. Gray for
the appellant

H. Fisher for
respondent

Idington J.—I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs
and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.

I agree so fully with the reasons assigned by
Mr. Justice Lamont in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal that I
need not repeat same here.

Duff J.—The judgment of Mr. Justice Taylor was reversed by the Court of
Appeal on the ground that the evidence of the plaintiff established that there
was no seduction within the meaning of the statute. Mr. Justice Taylor's view
evidently was that the plaintiff's account of the occurrence to the effect that
she was overwhelmed by force could not be accepted in view of certain facts
which he considered established.

[Page 519]

These facts he thought incompatible with the
hypothesis of serious resistance by the plaintiff. Is the plaintiff precluded
by her own evidence given on cross-examination from maintaining the allegations
of her statement of claim which are the essential allegations of a cause of action
under the statute? The question is not without difficulty; but on the whole I
think it may properly be answered as Mr. Justice Taylor impliedly answered it.
If the rejection of the plaintiff's account necessarily involved the assumption
that she had committed perjury then I think the law would not permit her to
recover a judgment based on that assumption. But here no such assumption was
involved; the learned trial judge might very properly, as he did, conclude that
in the plaintiff's state of health, the plaintiff's impression of what occurred
had become blurred and could not be wholly relied upon as an accurate register
of what actually happened and that the only safe course was to draw the
inference properly arising from certain physical facts which pointed as he
thought very clearly to the conclusion at which he arrived. As a general rule,
no doubt, where a party calls a witness with his eyes open with full knowledge
of what the witness is likely to say (and more especially where the witness is
the party), it is not competent to that party to contradict him on a vital
point. That was held in Sumner v. Brown[5], by Mr. Justice
Hamilton. I think that rule is inapplicable to this case. It is, I think, a
question for the tribunal of fact to determine in such a case whether
statements made on cross-examination by such a witness as the plaintiff with
respect to such an occurrence was one which, having regard to all the
circumstances, ought to be treated as conclusive against her.

[Page 520]

Assuming in any case that there was an absence
of consent there was still a right of action for assault.

It has been laid down (see Smith v. Selwyn[6]), that where the facts
constituting the foundation of a cause of action in themselves constitute a
felony the right of action for tort is suspended until the plaintiff has
prosecuted the defendant if the plaintiff is the person on whom the duty of
prosecution falls; but this is an objection which cannot be raised as a defense
to an action on the pleadings and it is not a proper ground for non-suit. The
defendant's proper course is to raise it by an application to stay. Section 13 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada professes to abolish this rule. It may be
questioned whether this is a subject within the competence of the Parliament of
Canada as appertaining to the domain of the criminal law or as a proper subject
for the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction in the enactment of a Criminal Code .
But at least there is a declaration in the most deliberate and solemn form by
the legislative authority having jurisdiction over the criminal law, that the
rule is no longer necessary in the interests of public justice. As the rule has
its foundation in the supposed interests of public justice, it is at least, I
think, exceedingly doubtful whether in this country any action ought to be
stayed on such a ground.

That is a question which does not strictly arise
here because no application was made for a stay of the action and the rule, if
not entirely obsolete, ought at least to operate only within the straitest
limits allowed by precedent.

[Page 521]

Anglin J.—I had occasion very fully to consider the chief question which
arises on this appeal in the case of E. v. F.[7]. I have had no reason
to change the views there expressed. The only difference between that case and
the case at bar is that there the plaintiff was the father whereas in the
present case the girl herself brings the action by virtue of a statutory
provision enabling her to do so. That difference in my opinion does not suffice
to render inapplicable here the ground of decision in E. v. F.7.
I agree with the view of Mr. Justice Lamont that where, in an action
constituted as is that at bar, the plaintiff either in examination-in-chief or
in cross-examination gives evidence of circumstances which negative the
existence of violence sufficient to establish a case of ravishment, her right
to recover is not necessarily destroyed because she has alleged and sworn to
such violence. The reasons assigned by that learned judge in his dissenting
opinion are so satisfactory that I feel I cannot usefully add to them.

I would therefore with respect allow this appeal
with costs here and in the court of appeal and would restore the judgment of
the learned trial judge.

Mignault J.—The appellant testified that the respondent had connection with
her, but that it was without her consent and by force. The learned trial judge
discredited this latter statement, and indeed under the circumstances described
by the appellant it seems impossible that the respondent could have succeeded
in having connection with her unless she had allowed him to do so. But the
learned trial judge none the less believed that connection had taken place and
that the respondent was the father of the child to whom the appellant had given
birth.

[Page 522]

The respondent argues that the appellant's
action was an action for an assault amounting to rape; that in such an action
the learned trial judge could not give her judgment for seduction; and that the
appellant could not obtain a judgment for assault, because her statement that
connection with her was had by force and without her consent was rejected by
the trial judge.

In my opinion the learned trial judge could
credit one part of the appellant's testimony and disbelieve the other part as
being grossly improbable, not to say impossible. If, notwithstanding her
statement that she was not a consenting party but was overcome by force the
learned trial judge really believed, under all the circumstances, that a case
of seduction had been made out, he was certainly entitled to give the appellant
judgment for seduction. Of course, the position of the appellant on this appeal
is somewhat extraordinary for she, or her counsel for her, is forced to contend
that a part of her testimony was rightly discredited by the trial judge. But
there is no doubt in my mind that the judge at the trial could partly accept
and partly reject the appellant's story, as unquestionably a jury could do.
That is all I need to say, for I feel that I can add nothing to the dissenting opinion
of Mr. Justice Lamont in which I fully concur.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
reversed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.

Cassels J. (dissenting).—I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice. The plaintiff, Amelia MacKenzie, was at
the date of the alleged assault or rape (1st July, 1917) of the age of twenty
years. On the 30th

[Page 523]

of June, 1920, she was twenty-three years of
age. Her story as well as her conduct is full of inconsistencies and in my
opinion it would be a dangerous precedent to allow a judgment to stand based on
evidence such as that given on behalf of the appellant.

Appeal allowed with costs.

Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Bribery—Violation of provincial
Act—""Administration of justice""—Cr. C. ss. 2, 157, 164—(C) 31 Vict.
c. 71, s. 3—""The Saskatchewan Temperance Act"" Sask., S. (1917) c. 23.

A bribe given in order to induce a police
officer not to proceed against the party giving it for violation of ""The
Saskatchewan Temperance Act"" is given with intent to interfere with the
""administration of justice"" under section 157  of the Criminal Code . Idington
J. contra.

Per Idington J. (dissenting)—Section 157  of
the Criminal Code  can only herein be held relevant to a peace officer or public
officer as defined in the interpretation clause of the said code; and appellant
was not acting within such definition but merely performing a duty of
inspecting books under the ""Saskatchewan Temperance Act"", and
reporting, which could have been discharged by any one. The offence in question
was one against section 39 of the said ""Temperance Act"", and hence
impliedly excluded by section 154 of the said code from falling within section
157  thereof.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming the
judgment of the trial court, with a jury, in the judicial district of Swift
Current, in Saskatchewan.

[Page 176]

The accused appellant was indicted as follows
: ""For that he, … with intent to interfere corruptly with the due
administration of justice, did corruptly give to one … police officer a bribe …
in order to induce (him) not to proceed against the said (accused) for
violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act."" The accused was found
guilty by the jury but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of
Appeal.

The question submitted in the reserved case
stated by the trial judge and the circumstances of the case, are fully stated
in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

F. H. Chrysler K.C. for the appellant.

Harold Fisher for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was indicted in the King's Bench
Judicial District of Swift Current, in Saskatchewan, as follows:

……For that he, the said Jacob Kalick, on
the 20th of December, A.D. 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the
due administration of justice did corruptly give to one Abraham Weder, a Police
Officer, a bribe to wit—the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) in order to
induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed against the said Jacob Kalick for
violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance Act.

On this he was found guilty by the jury and
thereupon the learned trial judge reserved for the Court of Appeal the
following question:—

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the
Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157  of the Criminal Code ? The evidence
and charge to the jury is hereto annexed.

[Page 177]

The majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
answered in the affirmative.

The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Newlands
which gives us, by virtue of section 1024  of the Criminal Code , the
jurisdiction to hear an appeal therefrom, held that the offence disclosed by
the evidence did not fall within said section 157  of the Criminal Code  inasmuch
as it was not specifically defined by the said Code as a crime, and was
specifically provided for by the 39th section of the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act"" under and by virtue whereof the officer in question
was acting when alleged to have been bribed.

The section 39 of said Act reads as follows:—

39. 1. No police officer, policeman or
constable shall, directly or indirectly, receive, take or have any money for
reporting or not reporting any matter or thing connected with the
administration of this Act, or for performing or omitting to perform his duty
in that behalf, except the remuneration and allowances assigned him in virtue
of his office by the Government of the Province.

2. Any police officer, policeman or
constable receiving, or any person offering money contrary to the provisions of
this section shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of $100 and
in default of immediate payment, to imprisonment for three months.

He held that, inasmuch as Parliament has the
exclusive jurisdiction of declaring what is, or may constitute a crime, and had
only declared offences against provincial legislation to be crimes when and so
far as falling within section 164  of the Criminal Code , which he held could not
be so operative or effective as the circumstances in question herein required
in order to maintain said conviction. That section reads as follows:—

164. Everyone is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any Legislature in Canada by
wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

[Page 178]

That, which is simply a re-enactment of the
Criminal Code  of 1892, seems, not only an express declaration of what (when
merely resting upon disobedience of an Act of Parliament or of a legislature)
is to constitute an indictable offence, but also to limit or restrict the indictable
quality of the offence to something which is not within the reservation
expressed by the term

unless some penalty or other mode of
punishment is expressly provided by law.

That enactment of the Criminal Code  of 1892 was
in substitution of 31 Vict. ch. 71, sec. 3, which was the earliest enactment of
the Dominion Parliament giving the added strength of its enactment by virtue of
the exclusive jurisdiction it had over criminal law, to help the enforcement of
provincial legislation.

As I have always understood, the policy pursued
in this regard has been to help the provincial legislation but to carefully
abstain from trenching upon the provincial legislative powers, or wishes of the
provincial legislators, as expressed by themselves relative to the sanctions to
be imposed by provincial legislation.

Such being the case when we find any provincial
legislative enactment containing an express sanction to secure its enforcement,
its terms ought to be respected and be the limit in that regard.

It seems idle to take as our guide the vulgar
idea of what may constitute a crime, when we have a much better guide in the
history of the legislation emanating from Parliament as above outlined.

Then turning to the details of what has to be
considered in light thereof, we have, in section 2  of the Criminal Code , the
definition and interpretation of the words ""Peace Officer"" and
""Public Officer"" which are used in the said section 157 , now in
question.

[Page 179]

Why should we go beyond these for the purposes
of this case?

There certainly is nothing in the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act"" that seems to justify any departure from these
respective definitions, nor in the code to render it imperative to expand
either definition in relation to the particular officer in question herein.

What were his duties? What office did he fill,
under the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" which would render it fitting
he should be looked upon as either a peace officer or a public officer within
the meaning of section 157  of the Criminal Code , now in question?

He may have been in fact a peace officer, or
worn the uniform of such, but the actual duty in question which he had to
discharge was under the liquor department created under said Act to inspect the
books which appellant, as a druggist, was bound by said law to keep as a vendor
of liquor, and compare the incoming supply of liquors with the outgoings served
from said supply, and the prescriptions authorizing sales, and report the
result of such inspection and audit to his superior officer.

Any man or woman sent by the liquor department
to discharge such simple duty could have made just as good a report. It was not
in any legal sense necessary to have sent a constable, or peace officer, or
public officer, as defined by the code, to perform such a duty.

And sending one apparently so decorated surely
did not help to bring him within the meaning of section 157 .

The evidence of Weder, the officer in question,
tells the story as follows:—

[Page 180]

Q. What was the first conversation you had
with him?

A. When I came, into the drug store I asked
for the record and Mr. Kalick gave them to me and I went back into the
dispensary to do the work there.

I sat down at the little table in the
dispensary, Mr. Kalick came in and says ""listen here, I will give you
$100.00 and you leave the books alone.""

I said I would not do that. I then went to
work and started to check up the books and just before I was through Kalick
came up again and asked me how I was getting along.

I replied that I was of the opinion that he
had to account for some shortage. He said, ""I will give you $500 and you
leave the books alone,"" or rather, ""Fix up the books so that they
will be all right.""

I said I did not know whether he would be
short or not yet, that I was not through.

After I was through checking up the books I
found a shortage of liquor and I asked Mr. Kalick if he could account for the
shortage and he did not say anything to that.

So then he offered me $1,000 to call the
matter square, that is the way he put it.

This illuminates the story relative to the
nature of the duties that were being discharged and the offence of the
appellant.

Unless we are to hold that the administration of
the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" and ""the administration of
justice"" are synonymous terms, I fail to see how we can bring this
offence, which the foregoing quotation and the remainder of the story unfold,
assuming the strict interpretation of it as against the appellant, within the
meaning of the indictment assumed to be founded upon section 157  in question.

I have no doubt upon the facts interpreted as
contended for against the appellant, and in the absence of legislation relevant
thereto, that he might have been held to have offended at common law as
suggested in the court below, or against section 39 of the Saskatchewan
""Temperance Act,""

[Page 181]

I cannot see, even if the conviction herein
stands, how the appellant could plead that, if prosecuted at common law or
under said section 39 of said Act, in bar of such prosecution.

That seems to me not only the fair test, but the
one which the law imperatively requires to maintain this conviction as founded
on section 157 .

In short I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that
the offence now in question disclosed by the evidence was, if interpreted
against the appellant, clearly one against the above quoted section 39, s.s. 2,
and hence impliedly excluded by section 164  of the Criminal Code  from falling
within section 157 , now in question.

Moreover, assuming there might, in the absence
of special or specific legislation bearing on the question, have been found
something offensive against the common law, it is not that we have to deal with
but section 157 . And I submit we must read that and section 164  together, and
apply the law that fits the crime.

I, therefore, am of the opinion that the appeal
should be allowed.

Duff J.—The stated case is in these words:—

On Feb. 5th, 1920, at Swift Current, the
accused was found guilty by a jury on the charge: ""For that he, the said
J. Kalick, on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere
corruptly with the due administration of justice, did corruptly give to one
Abraham Weder, a police officer, a bribe, to wit: the sum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) in order to induce the said Abraham Weder not to proceed
against the said J. Kalick, for the violation of the Saskatchewan Temperance
Act.""

The question submitted for the opinion of the
Court is:

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
Police Officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the
Saskatchewan Temperance Act, given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157  of the Criminal Code ?

[Page 182]

It seems clear that giving a bribe to prevent
prosecution for an offence is prima facie an interference with the
administration of justice. Mr. Chrysler argues that it is not within those
words in the context in which they appear in section 157  on two grounds:

1. That the offence is specifically dealt with
in those parts of the same section as well as in section 164 of the code and that
the normal scope of the phrase must receive some restriction in consequence. I
cannot perceive the application of sec. 164  and as to the other parts of
section 157  they do not touch the case of accepting or giving a bribe for
affording protection against a prosecution for an offence and that the facts
proved established a case of giving a bribe for such a purpose is assumed in
the question submitted.

2. He argues that the application of the section
is limited to offenders or persons supposed to be or suspected of being or
fearing that they are offending against the criminal law strictly so called,
that is to say, against the criminal law as falling within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. While the word ""crime"" in
the Criminal Code  generally speaking applies only to crimes strictly so called
and probably has that restricted meaning in this section, I think there is
nothing requiring us to limit the meaning of the words administration of
justice in the way suggested.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Anglin J.—The reserved case assumes that the defendant endeavoured to
stifle a prosecution for a violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" by bribing a police officer, Was the
bribe

given with intent to interfere with the
administration of justice under section 157  of the Criminal Code 

is the question propounded. In my opinion it
was.

[Page 183]

It is quite immaterial whether the police
officer actually intended or contemplated instituting a prosecution. It
suffices that the appellant gave the bribe with intent to head off such a
proceeding. The due administration of justice is interfered with quite as much
by improperly preventing the institution of a prosecution as by corruptly
burking one already begun.

Two contentions were pressed by Mr. Chrysler—(a)
that interference with a prosecution for a contravention of a provincial penal
statute is not within the purview of section 157 of the code; and (b) that if
any offence against that section was committed it was that of bribing a police officer

to protect (the appellant) from detection
or punishment

and not that of

interfering corruptly with the due
administration of justice.

(a) The obvious purpose of section 157  is to
declare criminal and to render indictable the corruption or attempted corruption
of officers engaged in the prosecution, detection or punishment of offenders.
""Offenders"" is a very wide term (Moore v. Illinois)[2], and the use of it
affords a strong indication that the application of section 157  should not be
restricted, as counsel for the appellant argued, to cases in which the bribe is
offered or given to prevent the prosecution, detection or punishment of a
person who is, or apprehends that he may be, charged with a crime indictable
under the criminal code or at common law. The contravention of a valid
provincial penal statute is an offence and a person who commits it is an
offender.

(b) I am unable to agree with the contention
that, if what the appellant did amounted to bribing a Peace

[Page 184]

Officer with intent ""to protect (himself)
from detection or punishment etc."" within the concluding phrases of clause
(a) of section 157 , it cannot warrant his conviction for the crime of bribing a
peace officer with intent to interfere corruptly with the due administration of
justice provided for in the earlier and more comprehensive phrases of the same
clause. That the act charged against the appellant was done with intent to
interfere corruptly with the due administration of justice in the ordinary
acceptation of that phrase is conceded. The mere fact that it might also
warrant a conviction under the more restricted terms of the concluding phrase
of clause (a) is not, in my opinion, a sufficient reason for cutting down the
plain meaning of the earlier phrase. Other instances of similar overlapping
occur in the Criminal Code .

Moreover, in order to bring the case within the
concluding phrase of clause (a) a finding that the appellant had committed, or
had intended to commit, a contravention of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" would be essential. No such finding has
been made. No such issue was presented to the jury. No such charge was laid.
Whether the appellant had in fact committed, or had intended to commit, an
offence against the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" was quite irrelevant and immaterial to
the charge as laid. It was only essential that, being apprehensive of
prosecution for such an offence, the appellant should have bribed the police
officer with intent to prevent the realization of that possibility. Upon the
case presented he could not have been convicted under the concluding phrase of
clause (a); but upon the facts assumed in the reserved case he was, in my
opinion, rightly convicted under the earlier clause.

[Page 185]

It is quite unnecessary to consider whether the
breach of a provincial penal statute which provides its own penalty is a
""crime"" within the meaning of that word as used at the end of clause
(a) of section 157 . Expressing no opinion upon that question, I allude to it
merely to observe, with great deference, that cases such as In re McNutt[3], referred to by the learned Chief Justice
of Saskatchewan, and the later and decisive case of Mitchell v. Tracey[4], which deal with the meaning and scope of
the words ""arising out of a criminal charge"" in section 39 (c) of the
Supreme Court Act, would appear to me to afford little or no assistance in
determining it.

The appeal fails.

Brodeur J.—This is a criminal appeal. The appellant was convicted before a
duly constituted tribunal with having corruptly interfered with the administration
of justice in giving to a police officer a bribe of $1,000 in order to induce
this police officer not to proceed against him for violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act.""

The charge had been laid under section 157  of
the Criminal Code  which makes it an indictable offence for any person to give
to a police officer employed for the prosecution, detection or punishment of
offenders any money with intent

1° to interfere with the administration of
justice; or 2° to procure the commission of any crime; or 3° to protect from
detection or punishment any person having committed or intending to commit a
crime.

The reserved case which is now before us is
submitted in the following words:

[Page 186]

Was a bribe given in order to induce a
police officer not to proceed against the accused for violation of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act""
given with intent to interfere with the administration pf justice under section
157  of the Criminal Code ?

It is contended by the accused that he was
prosecuted for having corruptly interfered with the administration of justice,
that the giving of money to protect from detection any one committing a crime
before any proceedings have been instituted for the punishment of that crime is
not interfering with the administration of justice and that it is another
offence dealt with otherwise.

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan answered the reserved case in the affirmative, Mr. Justice Newlands
dissenting.

The police officer who received the bribe had
been instructed by his superior officers to check the liquor sales made by the
appellant and to see whether the latter had unlawfully sold any liquor contrary
to the dispositions of the Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act,"" and to find out whether information
should not be laid against the appellant.

The work which the police officer was carrying
out was authorized by the law and was absolutely necessary to put the wheels of
justice in motion.

I am of opinion that the ""administration of
justice"" mentioned in section 157  of the Criminal Code  should not be
restricted to what takes place after an information had been laid; but it
includes the taking of necessary steps to have a person who has committed an
offence brought before the proper tribunal, and punished for his offence. It is
a very wide term covering the detection, prosecution and punishment of
offenders.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

[Page 187]

Mignault J.—On the ground that the charge against the appellant, and on which
a verdict of guilty was returned by the jury, comes within the terms of article
157  of the Criminal Code , the jury having found the appellant guilty of having,
on the 20th day of December, 1919, with intent to interfere corruptly with the
administration of justice, corruptly given a bribe to a police officer to
induce him not to proceed against the appellant for violation of the
Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act,"" I am of opinion that the question
submitted should be answered in the affirmative. To give a bribe to a police
officer with this intent is a corrupt interference with the administration of
justice within the terms of Article 157 . It is, in my opinion, immaterial
whether proceedings were then pending or merely likely to be taken, and I do
not think that the fact that these proceedings were to be instituted under the
Saskatchewan ""Temperance Act"" takes the case out of the operation of
this section of the Criminal Code .

The appeal therefore fails and should be
dismissed.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Speedy trial—Election—Jury
trial—Requirement by the Attorney-General—Sections 446 (a), 690, 825, 826, 827,
828, 830, 833, 873, 1018, 1024 Cr. C.—(D.) 32-33 Vict, c. 29, s. 28—(D.) 8-9 Ed.
VII, c. 9, s. 2.

The appellant was accused of an offence,
punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding five years and for which he
had the right of election to be tried by a judge or a jury. He first elected to
be tried by a jury and, after the preliminary hearing, he was committed for
trial. Whilst still in custody of the sheriff, he wrote to the latter that he
was electing for a speedy trial and the sheriff notified the judge of the
sessions of this election. He was then brought before a district magistrate and
there elected for a speedy trial. Later on, the Attorney-General signed a
declaration that the indictment has been on his order ""brought before the
grand jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the appellant
tried before a jury and found guilty.

Held, Idington
J. dissenting, that the conviction of the appellant by a jury was legal.

Per Sir Louis
Davies C.J. and Duff J.—The requirement signed by the Attorney-General was in
compliance with section 825 Cr. C., as amended by 8-9 Ed. VII, c. 9. s.
2.—Idington J. contra and Anglin J. semble.

Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.—The election for a
speedy trial made by the appellant before a district magistrate was not valid,
as it should have been made before the residing judge of the sessions of the
Peace, according to section 827 Cr. C.

Per Idington
J. (dissenting).—The election by the appellant for a speedy trial, contained in
his letter to the sheriff, was valid, as being made in conformity with s.s. 2
of s. 828 Cr. C., and any subsequent irregularity could not affect the
appellant's rights.

Judgment of the Court of King's Bench
affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.

[Page 264]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the
trial judge, Desy J., with a jury and dismissing the motion made by the
appellant for a stated case.

The material facts of the case and the
questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments
now reported.

Fernand Choquette for the appellant.

Lucien Cannon K.C. for
the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—At the close of the argument on this appeal, I
was of the opinion that the only arguable point requiring consideration was to
the effect that the Attorney-General had not complied with the amendment to
section 825  of the Criminal Code , 8-9 Ed. VII., Ch. 9, which enacted that

where an offence charged is punishable with
imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, etc.

It was admitted that the offence charged in the
indictment came within this section.

After examining the indictment filed with the
record, it seems to me quite clear that there is nothing in this objection.

The indictment appears first to have been signed
by the crown prosecutors on behalf of the Attorney-General under section 873,
but in addition to this the Attorney-General personally signed a requirement on
the back of the indictment that ""it should be brought before the grand
jury."" It was so brought, a true bill was found and the prisoner tried
before a jury and found guilty.

[Page 265]

It seems to me therefore that the amending
section of 825 has been fully complied with.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Idington J. (dissenting).—The appellant was brought before the magistrate of
the District of Quebec upon the accusation of an offence which entitled him to
a right of election to be tried by a judge or jury, and he elected the latter,
on the 28th April, 1920. Thereupon he was duly committed for trial accordingly.

On the 5th of May, following, whilst still in
custody of the sheriff, he availed himself of the privilege given by subsection
2  of section 828  of the Criminal Code , which provides as follows:—

2. Any prisoner who has elected to be tried
by a jury may, notwithstanding such election, at any time before such trial has
commenced, and whether an indictment has been preferred against him or not,
notify the sheriff that he desires to re-elect, and it shall thereupon be the duty
of the sheriff and judge or prosecuting officer to proceed as directed by
section eight hundred and twenty-six.

The sheriff duly notified the judge of the
sessions of this election.

Some question is now raised, for the first time,
as to whether the judge to whom the notice was delivered in fact was a judge of
the sessions.

That, to my mind, is quite immaterial. When once
the accused has duly made his election in the manner prescribed by the statute,
he has duly established his right to be tried by a judge, unless by virtue of
some other provision in the statutes that right has been overruled, or taken
away.

There is no pretence herein that any such
overruling of his election as was possible, under subsection 3 of the said
section, was seriously considered and

[Page 266]

determined against him. No such contention has
been set up. And if any mistake arose in the delivery of the sheriff's notice,
when properly addressed as the record before us shews or in the proceedings
thereon the prisoner must not suffer for that.

What is relied upon with more assurance is that
contained in the Criminal Code  Amendment Act, 1909, which, amongst other
changes, amended section 825  as it theretofore stood by adding subsection 5,
which reads as follows :—

5. Where an offence charged is punishable
with imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General may
require that the charge be tried by a jury, and may so require notwithstanding
that the person charged has consented to be tried by the judge under this part,
and thereupon the judge shall have no jurisdiction to try or sentence the
accused under this part.

Under this sub-section undoubtedly the
Attorney-General for the province can overrule the appellant's election.

The sole question with me herein is one of fact.
Did the Attorney-General deliberately decide, in light of the foregoing facts,
that the appellant should be deprived of his prima facie right of
election to trial by a judge instead of by a jury?

Curiously enough the opinion judgment of Mr.
Justice Martin seems expressly to admit that the indictment upon which the
appellant was convicted by the jury was

on the 9th of June * * * preferred against
the accused before the Grand Jury of the District then in session, upon the
order of the Attorney-General of the Province, under the provisions of Article
873  of the Criminal Code .

And Mr. Justice Pelletier in like manner attributes such action as the Attorney-General took
to have been done pursuant to same article 873  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 267]

That article reads as follows:—

873. The Attorney-General or any one by his
direction or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of
criminal jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of
indictment for any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such
consent.

2. Any person may prefer any bill of
indictment before any court of criminal jurisdiction by order of such court.

3. It shall not be necessary to state such
consent or order in the indictment and an objection to an indictment for want
of such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before
the accused person is given in charge.

4. Except as in this part previously
provided no bill of indictment shall be preferred in any province of Canada.

If what was done by the Attorney-General in way
of the preferment by the indictment in question is attributable to the
operation of said section, then, what was done by such preferment certainly
does not fall within the meaning of the amendment of section 825 , by adding
subsection 5 above.

Up to the time of this express amendment the
Attorney-General could not, nor could any one on his behalf, take away the
right of election given the accused, though the learned judge or prosecuting
officer before him, had long had the power, under section 828 , subsection 3 , of
refusing to allow the exercise of the right of re-election in special cases
whenever they deemed it would not be in the interests of justice.

The occasion for this, by some mischance I am
unable to understand, possibly never arose. A possibly accidental absence of
the judge qualified to act is one surmise if, as suggested in argument, he who
did act was not, but then that could not deprive accused of the election he
made by his letter to the sheriff and forwarded by the sheriff's letter to the
right judge.

Be all that as it may, if the accused was not
brought up before the right judge, as the statute requires, that was the fault
of the prosecuting counsel,

[Page 268]

else we should not have the judicial assent
indorsed on the sheriff's letter, and that did not take away this right of the
accused, and due regard should have been had to the fact, on the motion to
quash the indictment. Any irregularity on the part of the local authorities in
the matter could not, as appears by Reg. v. Burke[1], affect the appellant's rights.

With great respect, neither of these learned
judges in appeal seems to me accurately to have distinguished that which may
rest upon section 873  from that which must rest upon section 825 , subsection 5 ,
added by the amendment of 1909. I agree with them that section 873  was all that
parties acting had in mind. The former is intended to govern the right to go
before a grand jury to prefer an indictment, which right at common law was
possessed by all the King's subjects but, by later legislation, was cut down to
what the Attorney-General might permit, or the learned judge presiding might,
on application to him; permit or order.

That modern way of restricting and regulating
proceedings before a grand jury was first introduced, so far as I can find,
into Canada by the Act
respecting Criminal Procedure of 1869, 32-33 Vict., Ch. 29, sec. 28, confined to something like half a dozen offences.

Needless to trace how this at one time known as
relating to vexatious indictments was developed until the restriction became
complete and was subjected to the requirements of said section 873 , just
quoted.

It is, however, imperatively necessary to bear
in mind herein the origin and purpose of that section and its requirements as
distinguishable from the origin and purpose of the later enactment of 1909,
upon which the decision of this appeal should turn.

[Page 269]

The mode in which the numerous attorneys general
of different provinces carried out the earlier enactment might vary in minor
details and, especially in the method of expression adopted for causing those
concerned to know and understand that required assent, no doubt differed.

That would, speaking generally, be a matter of
minor consequence.

It is a very different object that is to be
attained by the action of the Attorney-General upon the new section 825 ,
subsection 5 , quoted above, which involves the taking away of a right of
election given to an accused person and implies the exercise of a kind of
judicial power or authority which the Attorney-General is, I submit, expected
by the amendment to specially direct his mind to in each case coming up for
action. The power is expressly one given to him alone and cannot be transferred
to another.

I am unable to see on this record any clear
exercise of any such power. What does appear therein seems to me more aptly
attributable to the provisions of section 873  as, by two of the learned judges
below, seems to have been inferred.

What possible reason could exist for the
exercise of such a power relative to what seems, at first blush, a very
ordinary sort of offence?

And again, if the Attorney General really
intended to take away the right from an accused of trial before a judge, I
should have expected I respectfully submit, to find it expressed by apt
language which would have left no room for argument, and that which we are
referred to does not express anything but what is consistent only with a
direction under section 873 .

[Page 270]

Moreover how could there have been left in the
mind of any one concerned in the motion to quash the indictment, before accused
was forced to plead thereto, any doubt or difficulty, for if in fact the fiat
indorsed was in truth intended to mean what is contended for, surely in the
City of Quebec, above all places, that could easily have been set at rest by an
affidavit or otherwise.

Those accused of crimes may, in the majority of
cases, be at bottom in some minds entitled to very little consideration.

But we must guard their rights as sacredly as
possible, and remember that society is not well served by the conviction of any
man unless by due process of law strictly adhered to.

I think the appeal should be allowed, for the
reasons I have assigned, and that the right to have a case stated should have
been given him and, by reason not only of default thereof but under and by
virtue of the powers assigned in such event by sections 1018 and 1024,
respectively, to the Court of King's Bench and this Court, the conviction
should be quashed, or, if the majority of the court so conclude, referred back
to the learned trial judge to state such case as he should have stated.

See The King v. Hébert[2],
and Reg. v. Hogarth[3], as
well as Reg. v. Burke[4],
already cited.

Duff J.—I concur with the Chief Justice.

Anglin J.—Only one of the objections to the validity of his conviction
taken on behalf of the defendant calls for consideration. It is that based on

[Page 271]

the alleged absence from the record of anything
which establishes the exercise by the Attorney-General of the power conferred
on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825  of the Criminal Code  (8-9 Ed. VII, e. 9, s. 2 ) to
require that a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a
period exceeding five years shall be tried by a jury notwithstanding that he
has consented to speedy trial by a judge. The jurisdiction of the Court of
King's Bench in proceeding with the trial of this case is thus challenged. If
there was a valid election by the accused for a speedy trial, the jurisdiction
of that court was thereby superseded (ss. 825 , 827  and 833, Cr. C.; Reg v.
Burke[5]; Rex
v. Bissonnette[6], per
Lamothe C.J.) and could be re-established only by the Attorney-General
personally exercising the special power conferred on him by s.s. 5 of s. 825 .
Being a condition of jurisdiction the fact that the authority had been
exercised should appear on the face of the proceedings. The ordinary
presumption in favour of the jurisdiction of a superior court scarcely covers
such a case.

The law does not prescribe any particular method
in which the Attorney-General is to act. Neither is notice to any person or
body required. Nor is it necessary that the Attorney-General should make his
requisition in open court. I am satisfied that the indorsement over his
signature on the indictment of his authorization for its presentment, provided
it is couched in terms which unmistakably imply action under s.s. 5 of s. 825 ,
will suffice.

But s. 873 Cr. C. likewise provides for the
preferring of indictments by or on behalf of the Attorney-General before a
grand jury. The power which that section confers, however, should not be
exercised where the

[Page 272]

accused has already elected for speedy trial,
and he may so elect after an indictment has been preferred under it. Giroux v.
the King[7]. This
latter step was not taken in the present case, counsel for the prisoner relying
on what he assumed to have been a valid election for speedy trial already made
in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, and the case appears to have proceeded
in the Court of Appeal on the footing that such an election had been duly made.

Counsel for the Attorney-General very frankly
stated, in answer to a direct question put by me, that if the indictment now
before us had been preferred under the authority of s. 873 it would have been
in its present form and might have carried precisely the indorsement found upon
it, namely:

Le présent acte d'accusation ""indictment'' est porté devant le grand jury par
ordre du soussigné procureur général de la Province de Québec.

9 juin 1920.

(Signé) L. A.
Taschereau,

Proc. Général de la
prov. de Quebec.

In other words, so far as the proceedings shew,
the action taken by the Attorney-General in regard to the presentation of this
indictment is referable quite as readily to s. 873 as to s.s. 5 of s. 825 . It
is therefore impossible to say that it imports a requisition under the latter
provision. Under these circumstances, if there had been a valid election for
speedy trial, in my opinion it would be extremely doubtful, to say the least,
whether the conviction could stand and whether the motion to quash the
indictment made on behalf of the accused before plea should not have prevailed.

[Page 273]

But I find it unnecessary to determine this
question since, in addition to relying on the indorsement on the indictment as
sufficient evidence of the exercise of the power conferred by s.s. 5 of s. 825 ,
counsel representing the Attorney-General now insists, as it is quite within
his right to do (a respondent may support the judgment a quo on any
ground), that there was no valid election for a speedy trial because the
attempt of the accused to make such an election did not take place before the
judge of the Sessions of the Peace as contemplated by s. 827 Cr. C. Election
before the prosecuting officer (s.s. 2) is not suggested.

The District Magistrate, Corriveau, before whom
the record shews the accused was brought to make his election, was without
jurisdiction to receive it because there was at that time a Judge of the
Sessions of the Peace for the District of Quebec (s. 823 ii) as appears in the
record and is admitted by counsel for the appellant.

I cannot accede to the suggestion that the
notice to the sheriff, not required in this case (s. 826), but provided for in
other cases by ss. 825 (6) , 828 (2) , and 830 (2)  itself constitutes an
election. Where it is made part of the procedure, that notice is a preliminary
step leading to the accused being given an opportunity to make his election by
being brought before the proper officer for that purpose. But the statute makes
it very clear that the election itself must take place before the judge or the
prosecuting officer ss. 825 (7), 826 and 827.

There was therefore no election by the accused
for a speedy trial sufficient to bring either ss. 3 and 4 of s. 827 or s. 833
into operation. It follows that, the

[Page 274]

jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench never
having been superseded, its re-establishment by action of the Attorney-General
under s. 825 (5) was not necessary. The indictment can be supported under s.
873.

I regard this rather as a case of first election
within s. 826 (7), than as a case of re-election within s. 828 . Section 830 (2)
would be applicable, however, if the accused upon withdrawing his original
election for a summary trial had elected to be tried by a jury and the warrant
of committal for trial had so stated. That warrant is not in the record, and
the election which preceded it is stated in the proceedings to have been merely
to proceed by preliminary investigation in lieu of summary trial.

There was evidence on which a jury could find
the defendant guilty of the charge laid against him. Taken as a whole as it
must be, the charge is not open to the objections raised. The sentence imposed,
while apparently severe, was within the jurisdiction of the court. It is not
within our province to review its propriety.

The defendant may have a real grievance in that
he was not given the opportunity to which he was entitled of making an election
for a speedy trial before a competent judicial officer. But I know of no
redress for that grievance which it is open to us to accord him in this appeal.

Brodeur J.—Il s'agit d'un appel sous les dispositions
de l'article 1024 du code
criminel.

La question qui nous est soumise est de savoir si
la Cour du Banc du Roi avait juridiction pour juger l'appelant.

[Page 275]

Ce dernier allègue qu'ayant été accusé sous l'article 446a du code criminel, il a
opté pour un procès expéditif et que plus tard, malgré son option, il a été
amené par acte d'accusation devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, où il a été jugé et
condamné à quinze ans de pénitencier.

La Couronne pretend que l'appelant n'a jamais fait d'option valable et que, même s'il en a fait
une, le Procureur-Général avait le droit de le poursuivre par acte d'accusation
devant la Cour du Banc du Roi sous les dispositions de l'article 825, s. 5 du code criminel. A cela l'accusé répond que le Procureur-Général ne
paraît pas avoir régulièrement fait la demande dont parle l'article 825, s. 5.

Y a-t-il eu option d'un procès expéditif par
l'accusé? Les pièces que nous avons devant nous ne sont pas très claires sur ce
point. Il est bien évident cependant que l'accusé désirait avoir un procès
expéditif sous les dispositions de la partie 18ème du code criminel. En effet,
après que le magistrat de district qui avait fait l'enquête préliminaire, eut,
le 5 mai 1920,
jugé la preuve suffisante pour lui faire subir un procès
(art. 690) et l'eût envoyé en
prison pour y être détenu en attendant son procès, les avocats de ce dernier
ont notifié le shérif, qui avait la garde de l'accusé, qu'il optait pour un
procès expéditif et qu'il fut amené devant

la Cour des Sessions dans le plus court délai
possible afin qu'il puisse faire sa déclaration à cet effet.

Le shérif, le 6 mai, informe par lettre le Juge des Sessions, suivant les dispositions
de l'article 826 du code criminel,
que Minguy déclare faire option pour ""un procès expéditif"". Cette
lettre du shérif est versée au dossier et nous y voyons sur le dos de la lettre
l'entrée suivante:

[Page 276]

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy. Option pour demander un
procès éxpéditif. Prod le 5 1920.

(Signé)                        T. & G.      G.P.

Le mois n'est pas mentionné, mais les parties
reconnaissent que c'est le mois de mai et que les initiales T. et G. sont
celles de Talbot et Gendron,
Greffiers de la Paix.

Nous voyons ensuite sur le dos de la même lettre
l'entrée suivante:

Québec, 7 mai 1920.

Présent: M. le Juge Corriveau, M.D.D.

Le prévenu étant présent, la décision sur son
option pour procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai 1920.

Gus. Chouinard,

D.G.P.

Les initiales M.D.D. signifient Magistrat de
district et celles D.G.P. signifient Député Greffier de la Paix.

Ces deux entrées que nous retrouvons sur la lettre
du shérif me paraissent peu explicites et correctes.

D'abord le 5 mai il n'a pas pu y avoir d'option pour procès expéditif, car à cette
date l'accusé n'avait pas encore été amené devant le Juge des Sessions. La
lettre du shérif adressée au Juge des Sessions n'a été envoyée que le 6 mai et ce n'est que le 7 que le prévenu comparaît devant un juge, qui
n'est pas, cependant, le Juge des Sessions mais un Magistrat de district,
celui-là même qui avait condamné l'accusé à subir son procès.

Il est admis par les deux parties qu'il y a un juge
des sessions à Québec.

En vertu du code criminel (Partie XVIII), les options pour procès expéditifs
doivent avoir lieu (art. 827) devant
le juge qui est défini par l'article 823 comme étant le Juge des Sessions. Le magistrat de district, suivant ce
dernier article, n'a juridiction que dans le cas où il n'y a pas de juge des
sessions.

[Page 277]

Le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, n'avait
donc pas juridiction dans le district de Québec où il y avait un juge des
sessions. Par conséquent, le prévenu n'a donc pu faire d'option valable pour un
procès expéditif.

D'ailleurs a-t-il fait une option qui enlevait à la
Cour du Banc du Roi toute juridiction?

L'entrée qui est sur la lettre du shérif, en date
du 7 mai, démontre qu'il n'y a pas
eu d'adjudication sur l'option du prévenu pour procès expéditif. L'entrée
n'exprime probablement pas correctement ce qui a eu lieu. A raison de ce qui
est survenu subséquemment, je serais porté à croire que ce jour-là, le 7 mai, la Couronne a fait une demande ou bien a
manifesté l'intention d'avoir un procès par jury, et que la question est restée
en suspens de savoir si l'accusé serait jugé à la Cour des Sessions ou à la
Cour Criminelle.

Avant l'amendement de 1909
(8 et 9 Ed. 7, ch. 9, s. 2), le privilège de
l'accusé de choisir un procès expéditif était absolu; et du moment que son
consentement pour un procès expéditif était inscrit au dossier, son procès
devait avoir lieu conformément aux dispositions de la partie XVIII du code criminel (art. 825, s.s. 2, 3 et 4 code criminel, S.R.C.
1906) c'est-à-dire devant le Juge
des Sessions de la Paix.

Les amendements de 1909 ont ajouté plusieurs autres sous-sections à l'article 825, et notamment une à l'effet que le
Procureur-Général peut faire une demande que le procès ait lieu devant un jury.

Il me semble que cette demande, si elle ne peut pas
être refusée, ainsi que le prétend l'intimé, doit être au moins consignée au
dossier de la cause afin d'évoquer la cause devant la Cour du Banc du Roi ou
bien d'enlever au Juge des Sessions toute juridiction.

[Page 278]

Dans la cause actuelle, je suis d'opinion que
l'accusé a bien désiré opter pour un procès expéditif: mais son consentement
n'a pas été fait devant le juge compétent. Alors le Procureur-Général pouvait,
sous l'article 873 du code
criminel, porter un acte d'accusation devant le Grand Jury.

L'appelant se plaint aussi de l'illégalité des
instructions du juge au jury, mais il n'y a rien dans ces instructions qui
violent aucun principe de droit. Quant aux faits nouveaux qu'il prétend avoir
découvert depuis le procès et quant à la sévérité de la sentence, ce sont des
questions qui ne sauraient justifier notre intervention.

L'appel doit être renvoyé.

Mignault J.—Il y a deux questions à
examiner sur cet appel, car les autres griefs d'appel, dans mon opinion, sont
mal fondés; 1° L'appelant a-t-il
réellement opté pour un procès expéditif; 2° S'il y a eu telle option, l'acte d'accusation (indictment) sur lequel le procès a eu lieu
démontre-t-il que le procureur-général de la province de Québec exerçait le
pouvoir que lui confère le paragraphe 5 de l'article 825 du code
criminel, ou bien celui de l'article 873 du même code, qui permet au procureur-général ou à ses représentants de
soumettre un acte d'accusation au grand jury? Le pouvoir exercé sous l'article 825, al. 5, est d'une portée plus considérable que celui que confère l'article 873, car il rend sans effet l'option pour un
procès expéditif. Mais lorsque telle option n'a pas été valablement faite, il
va sans dire que l'acte d'accusation présenté par le procureur-général sous
l'opération de l'article 873, confère
pleine juridiction à la cour qui juge le procès. Du reste, dans l'espèce, le
magistrat

[Page 279]

de district avait fait l'enquête préliminaire et
avait déclaré qu'il y avait lieu de faire subir un procès au prévenu, de sorte que l'acte d'accusation aurait pu être soumis au grand jury sans l'ordre du
procureur-général.

Maintenant y a-t-il eu option du prévenu pour un
procès expéditif? Si j'arrive à la conclusion que la réponse doit être dans la
négative, je n'aurai pas besoin d'exprimer d'opinion sur la deuxième question.

Il est hors de doute que l'appelant désirait avoir
un procès expéditif, mais le désir ne suffit pas, il faut que l'option
elle-même soit faite devant une personne autorisée à la recevoir. A cet égard,
les parties admettent qu'il y a à Québec un juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'honorable M. Choquette. Il y a aussi un magistrat de district, M. Philéas
Corriveau.

Après son arrestation, l'appelant fut amené devant
le juge des Sessions de la Paix, où il fit option pour un procès sommaire. Il lui
fut cependant permis plus tard de se
désister de cette option, et de procéder par enquête préliminaire. Cette
enquête, si le magistrat trouvait matière à procès, pouvait, suivant son choix,
le conduire soit à un procès expéditif devant le juge des Sessions de la Paix,
soit à un procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi siégeant au criminel. Pour le
premier, le procès expéditif, il fallait une option du prévenu: pour le second,
le procès devant la cour du Banc du Roi, aucune option n'était requise.

Le 5 mai
1920, le magistrat de district
déclara, je l'ai dit, qu'il y avait matière à procès. Le même jour les
procureurs de l'appelant écrivirent au shérif de Québec le notifiant que leur
client désirait opter pour un procès expéditif et le prièrent, en conséquence,
d'amener l'accusé devant la cour des sessions dans le

[Page 280]

plus court délai possible afin qu'il pût faire sa déclaration à
cet effet. Sur réception de cette lettre, le shérif, le 6 mai, écrivit au juge des Sessions de la Paix,
l'informant que l'accusé

déclare maintenant faire option pour un procès
expéditif.

D'après le code criminel, article 826, paragraphe 1er,

Tout shérif doit, dans les vingt-quatre heures
après qu'un prévenu ainsi que ci-haut est préventivement incarcéré en attendant
son procès, informer le juge par écrit que ce prévenu est ainsi incarcéré,
relatant son nom et la nature de l'accusation portée contre lui, sur quoi le
juge fait comparaître le prévenu devant lui sous le plus court délai possible.

Remarquons que par l'expression ""juge,""
la loi entend, dans le cas du district de Québec, le juge des sessions (art. 823 code crim.). Lorsque le prévenu est amené
devant le juge, celui-ci, après avoir pris communication des dépositions à la
suite desquelles le prévenu a été incarcéré:

(a) fait connaître au prisonnier de quelle
infraction il est accusé et lui en décrit la nature; et (b) lui explique qu'il
peut, à son choix, subir son procès immédiatement devant un juge sans
l'intervention d'un jury, ou rester en prison ou sous caution, selon que la
cour en décide, pour subir son procès de la manière ordinaire devant la cour
qui a juridiction criminelle. (Art. 827 code criminel.)

Si, lors, de cette comparution devant le juge, le
prévenu consent à subir son procès devant lui, sans l'intervention d'un jury,
le procès qu'on appelle expéditif se fait devant le juge.

D'après l'article 828 , paragraphe 2 ,

tout prisonnier qui a opté pour le procès
devant un jury, peut nonobstant l'option ainsi faite, en tout temps avant le
commencement du procès, et soit qu'une accusation ait été ou non portée contre
lui, notifier, au shérif, qu'il désire revenir sur sa décision; sur quoi le
shérif et le juge ou le fonctionnaire poursuivant doivent suivre la procédure
prescrite par l'article huit cent vingt-six.

[Page 281]

Cette notification au shérif se fait dans le cas où
un prévenu, qui a opté pour le procès devant un jury, désire revenir sur sa
décision, et alors le shérif et le juge doivent suivre la procédure prescrite
par l'article 826 dont j'ai cité
le premier alinéa. Dans l'espèce, l'appelant n'avait pas opté en faveur d'un
procès devant un jury, mais avait choisi une enquête préliminaire, laquelle, je
l'ai dit, pouvait conduire soit au procès expéditif devant le juge des
sessions, soit au procès ordinaire devant un jury.

Le deuxième alinéa de l'article 828  suppose qu'il y a eu choix d'un procès
devant un jury, choix que le prévenu désire rétracter. Il y a une disposition
au même effet, et pour le même cas de rétractation d'option, aux alinéas 2 et 3 de l'article 830. Il y a
également une disposition semblable à l'article 825, paragraphe 6, pour les
accusés sous caution, mais il n'y est pas question de rétractation d'option,
mais du choix d'un procès expéditif.

Apparemment on a procédé ici comme si l'appelant
avait choisi un procès par jury et voulait revenir sur ce choix, car c'est dans
ce cas qu'on s'adresse au shérif lorsque le prévenu est incarcéré. Dans
l'espèce, le shérif a informé par écrit le juge des sessions que l'appelant
désirait maintenant fake option
pour un procès expéditif.

Sur réception de cette lettre, le juge des sessions
aurait dû faire comparaître le prévenu devant lui, et lui faire les
déclarations exigées par l'article 827, et c'était alors le moment de faire l'option d'un procès expéditif. Au
lieu de cela, le 7 mai, on a fait
comparaître l'appelant devant le magistrat de district, M. Corriveau, et une
inscription au dos de la lettre du shérif—il semble au moins qu'on aurait dû faire une

[Page 282]

entrée au registre—indique que, le prévenu étant présent, la décision pour son option pour
procès expéditif est ajournée au 10 mai. En regard, on a écrit :

Le Roi vs. Alexandre Minguy, option pour procès
expéditif. Prod. le 5, 1920,

avec les initiales des greffiers de la paix au bas.

Est-ce pour la raison que M. Fernand Choquette,
avocat de l'appelant, nous a indiquée, de sa parenté avec l'honorable M.
Choquette, juge des sessions, dont il est le fils, que M. Corriveau, le
magistrat de district, a siégé le 7 mai? Les dispositions du code de procédure civile qui auraient empêché
M. Fernand Choquette de comparaître devant son père en matière civile ne
s'appliquent évidemment pas à un procès devant une juridiction criminelle, et
alors que j'apprécie hautement le sentiment de délicatesse qu'invoque le savant
avocat de l'appelant, qui a très habilement plaidé cette cause, il est évident
qu'on devait ici suivre la procédure qu'indique le code criminel. Or
malheureusement c'est devant le juge des sessions que devait se faire l'option
d'un procès expéditif, en réponse aux déclarations que celui-ci devait faire au
prévenu au désir de l'article 827; et comme il s'agit d'une matière de juridiction de droit commun, et que
la procédure par voie de procès expéditif est de nature exceptionnelle, et
exige le consentement du prévenu devant le juge des sessions, je ne puis
arriver à la conclusion que la Cour du Banc du Roi, siégeant au criminel, qui
est la juridiction de droit commun, a été dessaisie de la cause par ce qui
s'est passé devant le magistrat de district.

Les honorables juges de la cour d'appel paraissent
avoir pris pour acquis qu'il y avait eu choix d'un procès expéditif. Le fait
qu'ils n'ont pas discuté

[Page 283]

la question dont je viens de parler me dispose à
croire qu'elle a pu n'avoir pas été soulevée devant eux. Mais évidemment cette
question est préjudicielle, car s'il n'y a pas eu choix régulier d'an procès
expéditif, il n'importe nullement que le procureur-général n'ait pas déclaré
expressément qu'il exigeait le procès devant un jury malgré l'option pour un procès
expéditif. Je n'ai donc pas à exprimer d'opinion sur la question que les
honorables juges de la cour d'appel ont longuement discutée.

Les autres moyens invoqués par l'appelant, je l'ai
dit, sont dans mon opinion mal fondés. L'appel doit donc être renvoyé.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
 ALBERTA

Criminal law—Keeping of common bawdy house—Evidence of
general reputation—Sufficiency of evidence—Prima facie evidence under s. 986 (1)
Cr. C.

[Page 478]

Evidence of the general reputation of a house is admissible to
show that it is a bawdy house.

Held that, in view of such rule, it was sufficient, in
order to affirm the appellant's conviction, that the evidence made it clear
that the house was being maintained for the purpose of prostitution without
direct proof of the act itself and that such proof may be made, not only by
bringing evidence of general reputation but also of such facts, circumstances
and conditions as would warrant the inference and belief that the house was
being so maintained. More particularly it is clear that, under s. 986 [1]
Cr. C., the delay that occurred in opening the premises on the demand of the
police officers was prima facie evidence of guilt.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta[2],
dismissing (Lunney J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal against her
conviction for keeping and maintaining a common bawdy house.

[Page 479]

The material facts of the case and the conditions existing at
the house when the arrest was made have been summarized by Mitchell J., who
delivered the judgment of the majority of the appellate court, as follows:

About 6 p.m. two city constables proceeded to the house and
found it occupied by the accused. The front portion of the building purported
to be a confectionery store. At the rear are living rooms occupied by a Chinese
cook, and at times one or two girls. Adjacent to this is what is known as the
private dwelling of the accused. The stock consists of a very limited supply of
cigarettes, cigars and soft drinks. The shelving contains only
""dummies."" The city shop licence held by accused covering 1930 had
not been renewed. The entrance to the shop portion is kept locked and bolted at
all times. The window in the entrance door is screened, the view blocked and
the glass barred over with a strong wire screen. The constables have
""visited these premises off and on every few days in the past three
months"" and are known to the accused. The police find it difficult to
obtain ready access to the place but customers are scrutinized and have little
difficulty in gaining admission. No person wishing to purchase goods could get
in there without being scrutinized. On the evening in question the constables,
after considerable delay, were admitted to the premises by the accused. The
latter first pulled aside the window curtain of the door to ascertain who were
there, and instead of opening the door ran back into the room behind the store,
later returning and admitting the constables who proceeded to the room in the
rear of the premises. There they found the accused who was apparently in
charge, and known to be owner of the store. A man was found seated on a couch,
wearing an overcoat unbuttoned. Upon closer examination it was found that the
fly of his pants ""was all unbuttoned."" A girl was found in a clothes
closet, and on coming therefrom was seen to be adjusting her dress in some
manner. This girl disappeared from the place almost immediately and has not
since been seen by the police. During the past three months there have been two
or three different girls stopping in this house, and men have been seen going
to and coming from the same. One constable describes the traffic as heavy. What
appears to have been a somewhat unusual supply of liquor was found in the
adjoining house described as the accused's private dwelling. Upon being
questioned by Constable Clarke as to why his pants were unbuttoned, the visitor
gave the significant reply ""Well you know."" Two weeks previous to the
occasion now in question, the same constables upon making an examination of the
house were attracted by the action of the Chinaman cook adjusting an oil cloth
on the floor of the toilet room and discovered a trapdoor in the floor beneath
which a girl was concealed. They also at that time ""saw in the toilet a
laundry bag containing a number of used towels such as are used in these
places."" The evidence as to the general reputation of the premises is in
the main, as follows:—

Constable Clarke:

""Q. What is the general reputation of the place?—A. Oh,
bawdy house. The accused several times when we have been going in or coming
out, the accused has come out to the sidewalk and looked East and West to see
if we were about. That is the general condition.""

Constable Hunter:

""Q. What would you say as to the general reputation of
this house?—A. It is known to the police as a bawdy house.

[Page 480]

Court: You say it is known to the police as a
disorderly house?—A. Yes.

Mr. Cameron:
Q. What is that based on?—A. The reputation you mean?

Q. Yes, there has to be something to base it on. Did some one
tell you it was a bawdy house?—A. Well, I have gained my knowledge as a
constable on the beat from those I came in contact with.

Court: Q.
You were on beat there?—A. Yes,
for years, and I know the places well.

Mr. Cameron:
Q. That is all you found the reputation on?—A. Just merely on this ground.

Q. Men coming in and out?—A. I have no knowledge of the act of
prostitution other than the traffic that has been observed.

A. M. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.

W. S. Gray K.C. for the respondent.

On conclusion of the argument by counsel for the appellant and
for the respondent, heard during the morning sitting of the court, judgment was
reserved; and at the opening of the afternoon sitting, the judgment of the
court was orally delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—In this case the appellant was convicted by
a stipendiary magistrate for keeping a common bawdy house. Lunney J. dissents
on the alleged ground that there was no evidence. This is the only possible
ground of law which could be urged, as, if the question were one of weight of
evidence, there would be no appeal to this court under section 1023  of the
Criminal Code .

On examination of the matter, we are inclined to the view that
the judgment of Lunney J. amounts to nothing more than a holding that the
weight of evidence does not justify the conviction and that no question of law
is involved in the appeal; but, assuming that the question should be regarded
as one of law, i.e., that the dissent is based on the ground that there is no
evidence to warrant the inference of guilt, we are all clearly of the opinion
that there was evidence on which it could well be found that the accused was
guilty.

Whatever doubt there might be as to the propriety of the finding
that the other circumstances in evidence establish a case of prima facie guilt
against the accused, it is entirely clear that, under section 986 (1) Cr. C.,
the delay

[Page 481]

that occurred in opening the premises on
the demand of the police officers was prima facie evidence of guilt. The
evidence of the facts in this particular is uncontradicted and suffices to
maintain the conviction.

The evidence of the circumstances set out in the judgment of Mr.
Justice Mitchell is as follows:

It is well settled that evidence of a general reputation of
a house is admissible to show that it is a bawdy house. It is an element
tending to establish the offence charged. Clarke J.A., in Rex v. Roberts[3],
has pointed out that ""the gist of the offence is the keeping of the house
for purpose of prostitution, not the act of committing fornication.""
Having this in mind it seems to me that it is sufficient in this case, if the
evidence makes it clear that the house was being maintained for a specific
purpose without direct proof of the act itself. This may well be done by proof,
not only of a general reputation but of such facts, circumstances and
conditions as would warrant the inference and belief that the house was being
so maintained.

The inference may be drawn in this instance from the manner
in which the place was conducted, the arrangement of the premises, the presence
of men and women, the frequency of the visits to the place by men and the
hours, their appearance and conduct, as well as any other circumstance tending
to show the likelihood of unlawful intercourse between the sexes, and particularly
the conditions at the time of the arrest.

Here we have present many of the elements from which, when
coupled with general reputation, guilt may properly be inferred. The suggestive
answer to the constable, ""You know"" when interrogated respecting the
condition of his trousers, the unusual action of the female inmate, are all of
significance and relative to the charge.

We agree with what Mr. Justice Mitchell
said and, accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ALBERTA

Criminal law—Common betting house—Means or contrivances for
betting—Sufficiency of evidence of—Prima facie evidence—Ss. 229 and 986 (2) Cr.
C.

[Page 483]

An appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta.
(25 Alta. L.R. 273) affirming (Lunney J.A. dissenting), the appellant's
conviction for unlawfully keeping a common betting house (s. 229 Cr. C.)—

[Page 484]

The chief evidence consisted in the finding of certain cards
marked in duplicate and similar to those used for checking hats at a hotel, but
also suitable for the purpose of betting, which might constitute ""means or
contrivances for betting"" within the meaning of s. 986 (2) Cr. C.

Held that, in the absence of any suggestion in the
evidence as to the possibility of the duplicate cards having been used by the
appellant for any other purpose than that of betting, there was prima facie evidence
of guilt.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta[1],
dismissing (Lunney J.A. dissenting), the appellant's conviction for unlawfully
keeping a common betting house (s. 229 Cr. C.).

A. M. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.

W. S. Grey K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was orally delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—This is an appeal from the decision of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the conviction of
the defendant by a stipendiary magistrate for keeping ""a common gaming
house"" (s. 229, Crim. Code).

The chief evidence consisted in the finding of certain cards
suitable for the purpose of betting and which might constitute a
""means"" for betting under s. 986 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

In the absence of any suggestion in the evidence as to the
possibility of the duplicate cards found having been used by the appellant for
any other purpose than that of betting, there appears to have been prima
facie evidence of guilt.

We, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Unlawful
distribution of drugs—Indictment charging two separate sales—Whether
constituting two offences, contrary to s. 853 (3) Cr. C.—Meaning of the word
"" distribute "" as used in s. 4 (f) of c. 144, R.S.C., 1927, Opium and
Narcotic Drugs Act.

An appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming (Macdonald C.J. dissenting)
the appellants' conviction of having unlawfully distributed morphine and
cocaine, on the ground that the indictment, charging two separate sales,
therefore charged two offences contrary to the provisions of s. 853 (3) Cr. C.
The question on the appeal was whether the word ""distribute"" as used
in s. 4 (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act covered the facts
in the case.

Held, affirming the appellants' conviction, that, upon the
evidence, the appellants had the drugs in question for distribution and that
they did in fact "" distribute "" them. The appellants cannot contend
that, because two separate sales were proved in evidence, two offences were
actually charged, as there could be no distribution unless more than one sale
was proved.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing (Macdonald C.J. dissenting), the
appellants' appeal against their conviction of having unlawfully distributed
drugs.

The question in this appeal is
whether the word "" distributes"" as used in s. 4 (f) of Chap.
144, R.S.C., 1927, Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act, which enacts that

Every person who

(f) manufactures,
sells, gives away or distributes any drug to any person without first obtaining
a licence from the Minister;

shall be guilty of a
criminal offence ***.

covers this case. The appeal is
based on the ground that the indictment charges two separate sales and,
therefore, charges two offences, contrary to the provisions of section 853 (3) 
of the Criminal Code .

The conviction might have been
under subsection (d) as well as subsection (f) of section 4 of
chapter 144; but it

[Page 483]

purported to be under subsection
(f) and must be upheld under that subsection if at all.

J. R. Nicholson for the
appellants.

O. Bass K.C. for the
respondent.

On conclusion of the argument by
counsel for the appellants, and without calling on counsel for the respondent,
the judgment of the court was delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—To contend that,
because two separate sales were proved in evidence, two offences are actually
charged seems absurd. How could distribution be shown unless more than one sale
was proved? A single sale probably does not amount to "" distribution
"" within the meaning of that word, as used in the Criminal Code . There is
nothing to restrict what may be proved as evidence of distribution to a single
sale.

It is manifest that the
defendants had the drugs in question for distribution and the proof shows they
did in fact "" distribute "" them. That seems to be all that is
necessary.

As to the difficulty created by
the words "" to any person "" found in the section in question, it is
fully met by the interpretation clause in s. 31 (j) of c. 1 of R.S.C.,
1927, and by the admission of counsel for the appellant that "" any person
"" includes "" any persons.""

We are all of the opinion that
the appeal fails and must be dismissed.

a magistrate on a charge of attempted theft, were convicted and sentenced to
three years' imprisonment. They appealed to the Court of Appeal upon the ground
inter alia ""that the said sentence (was) excessive"". The Court
of Appeal, by a majority judgment[1] ,
ordered that the sentence ""be reduced *** to the term of two years and six
months*** ."" The appellants then made an application before Newcombe J. in
Chambers for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the
term of imprisonment was in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed by law
for the offence.

The judgment of Newcombe J. was
as follows :

These two applications
coming before me this morning, when it was explained by the prisoners' counsel
that each of the prisoners had appealed from his conviction, under the
provisions of the Criminal Code , to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,
and that the Court had dismissed these appeals, subject to a reduction of the
term by six months in each case,— I reject both applications, upon the view
that a judge in British Columbia would have been bound by the law of the case,
as interpreted by the provincial Court of Appeal; and that, as my jurisdiction
under the Supreme Court Act is concurrent with that of a single judge in
British Columbia, I am equally bound, and cannot in this proceeding review the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal.

H. R. Bray for the
appellants.

C. M. O'Brian K.C., for
the respondent.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—I fully concur in
the judgment of Mr. Justice Rinfret, who holds this court has no jurisdiction
because the offences charged exist under the common law independently of the
code.

However, had it been competent for
us to deal with that aspect of these cases, I would have been disposed to think
Mr. Justice Newcombe right, in deferring, as he did, to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia as to the right of the magistrate to impose two years in addition to
the six months. I doubt if it would have been competent for any judge in British Columbia to have ignored the judgment of the Court of Appeal dealing with the
matter; and, for that reason, I am inclined to think my brother Newcombe right
in considering that he was bound thereby.

[Page 580]

The judgment of Rinfret, Smith
and Cannon JJ. was delivered by

RINFRET J.—The petitioner was
arraigned before George Jay, Police Magistrate in and for the district of
Victoria, on the 24th day of November, 1930, on the charge that he, at the city
of Victoria, in the province of British Columbia,

between, on or about the 8th
day of November and the 23rd day of November, 1930, both dates inclusive, did
unlawfully attempt to steal the sum of $8,765.33, the moneys of Reginald
Pierce, contrary to the Criminal Code .

The petitioner consented to be
tried before the Police Magistrate on the said charge, pursuant to the
provisions contained in Part XVI of the Criminal Code  dealing with the summary
trial of indictable offences. After hearing evidence and argument, the Police
Magistrate found that the petitioner was guilty, that he ""must be
convicted on this charge"", and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment,
as appears by a true copy of the warrant of commitment attached to the
application.

The petitioner appealed to the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia upon several grounds, the most important of which
was ""that the said sentence (was) excessive"". The Court of Appeal, by
a majority judgment,[2] ordered
that the sentence

be reduced from three years'
imprisonment, as set out in the conviction by the Magistrate, to the term of
two years and six months *** and as and from the 4th day of December, 1930; and
that the appellant be imprisoned for such term.

Whereupon the petitioner made
this application for the issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus ad Subjiciendum
on the ground that the term of imprisonment was in excess of the maximum
punishment prescribed by law for the offence, and that the jurisdiction of the
magistrate in respect thereof was limited to the imposition of a sentence for a
term not exceeding six months. Mr. Justice Newcombe, following the view already
expressed by Sedgewick, J., in In re Patrick White[3]
and by Girouard, J., in In re Chas. Seeley[4]
, refused to interfere with the decision of the provincial court of appeal. The
petitioner now appeals to the court from the order made by Mr. Justice Newcombe
in chambers.

[Page 581]

At the hearing before the court,
counsel for the Crown, in limine, raised the objection that the Supreme
Court of Canada, or any of the judges of the court, was without jurisdiction to
entertain the present application because, as he contended, the commitment was
not ""in a criminal case under any Act of Parliament of Canada"", as
required by section 57 of the Supreme Court Act.

In In re J. H. Roberts[5]
, the present Chief Justice of this Court pointed to the fact that

both in its constitution and
in its jurisdiction, the Supreme Court is a purely statutory court *** subject
to certain qualifications and restrictions specified in *** the Supreme
Court Act;

that, in habeas corpus
matters the jurisdiction of a judge of the court is limited to commitments in
criminal cases under an Act of Parliament of Canada and that, except for that
purpose,

a judge of this court
possesses none of the original powers and is subject to none of the duties in
regard to Habeas Corpus of the ordinary courts of common law, whether
arising under the common law itself, or conferred by Imperial or Provincial
statutes.

That view of section 57 of the
Act was approved by the full court in Doherty v. Hawthorne[6] , where the decision of Mr. Justice Mignault, based
on the judgment in In re Roberts[7]
, was unanimously confirmed.

The appellant was convicted of
the offence of attempt to steal. Stealing or theft was a common law offence.
The Criminal Code  defines that offence, but it did not create it. An attempt to
steal was also a common law offence. (Regina v. McPherson[8].)
Every attempt to commit a felony or a misdemeanour was a misdemeanour at common
law, whether the crime attempted was one created by statute or at common law.
Archbold's Criminal Pleadings, 28th ed., p. 3 And, now, the distinction
between felony and misdemeanour has been abolished (Criminal Code , s. 14 ).

In the present case, the
magistrate has, in the warrant of commitment, described the offence, of which
the prisoner was found guilty, as ""contrary to the Criminal Code "",
presumably intending thereby to indicate, in view of section 15 , that the
offence was one ""liable to be prosecuted and punished under"" the
code. Whether or not such was the

[Page 582]

intention, it does not affect the
fact that theft and attempt to steal are not criminal offences by virtue of the
Criminal Code . They were criminal offences at common law; and, by force of the
Ordinance introducing the Criminal Law of England into British Columbia, they were criminal offences in that colony prior to Confederation and
prior to its union with Canada. (See sec. 11 of the Criminal Code ).

That the jurisdiction of the
judges of the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of habeas corpus
extends only to offences which are criminal by virtue of statutes of the
Parliament of Canada and not to offences which were criminal at common law is,
we think, the true effect of section 57 of the Supreme Court Act. (See In
re Pierre Poitvin[9]
, and In re Robert Evan Sproule[10]
, in each of which cases the commitment was for murder). In the Sproule
case[11] , we
draw particular attention to the reasons at pages 184, 203 and 240.

In In re Charles Dean[12]
, Mr. Justice Duff, having to deal with an application for habeas corpus
in a case of house-breaking, came to the conclusion that he had no
jurisdiction; and, speaking of section 57, then section 62, he said:

The language indicates an
intention on the part of Parliament to confer only a strictly limited
jurisdiction. Anything like frequent interposition in the administration of the
criminal law in the provinces by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada,
through the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus, would obviously
lead to the most undesirable results; and, before exercising the authority in a
given case, I think it is my duty to scrutinize most carefully the terms in
which that authority is given to ascertain whether or not the case is clearly
one of those in which it was intended to be exercised.

The jurisdiction extends
only, I think, to those cases in which the ""commitment"" has followed
upon a charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by virtue of
some statutory enactment of the Parliament of Canada; it does not, in my
opinion, extend to cases in which the ""commitment"" is for an offence
which was an offence at common law or under a statute which was passed prior to
Confederation and is still in force.

The opinion thus enunciated by
Mr. Justice Duff sitting in chambers may now be stated as being the opinion of
the court. In our view, his judgment is a correct expression of the law, and we
approve of it. As a result, in the present case, the objection by counsel for
the Crown to the

[Page 583]

jurisdiction of any judge of this
court is well taken ; the application of the petitioner cannot be entertained,
and the appeal must be dismissed.

This judgment likewise disposes
of the appeal on identical grounds from a similar order of Mr. Justice Newcombe
in the case of Blackman.

LAMONT J. (dissenting).—In this
case I find myself unable to reach the conclusion arrived at by the other
members of the court. The question involved in the appeal is the right of a
convicted person on an application for habeas corpus.

On the 4th day of December, 1930,
the accused in each of the above cases was convicted by George Jay, Police
Magistrate in and for the city of Victoria, B.C., for the offence stated in the Blackman
warrant of commitment as follows:

For that he, the said Jack
B. Blackman, between, on or about the 8th day of November, 1930, and the 23rd
day of November, 1930, both days inclusive, at the city of Victoria
aforesaid, did unlawfully attempt to steal the sum of $8,765.33, the moneys of
Reginald Pierce, contrary to the Criminal Code .

The accused, in each case, was
sentenced to three years' imprisonment.

Contending that the police
magistrate had no jurisdiction in a summary trial with the accused's consent,
under part 16 of the Criminal Code , to impose, for the offence charged, a
sentence of more than six months' imprisonment, the accused appealed to the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia. That court reduced the sentence to imprisonment for
two years and six months, holding that the police magistrate had jurisdiction
to award that sentence.

Being still of opinion that the
sentence imposed was in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed by law for
the offence on summary trial, the accused in each case made an application to
Mr. Justice Newcombe of this court for an order that a writ of habeas corpus
ad subjiciendum do issue.

The application was refused on
the following ground :

I reject both applications,
upon the view that a judge in British Columbia would have been bound by the law
of the case, as interpreted by the provincial Court of Appeal; and that, as my
jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act is concurrent with that of a
single judge in British Columbia, I am equally bound, and cannot in this
proceeding review the conclusion of the Court of Appeal.

[Page 584]

From the refusal of the
application the accused appeal to this court.

The jurisdiction of a judge of
this court on an application for habeas corpus is set out in section 57
of the Supreme Court Act, as follows:

57. Every judge of the court
shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any
treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several
provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the
purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under
any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

2. If the judge refuses the
writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.

Two questions are before us in
this appeal:

(1) Is a judge of this court who
has only concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several
provinces bound by the views of a provincial court of appeal as to the
jurisdiction of a magistrate to impose the sentence which he in fact imposed?

(2) Where the offence charged is
an offence both under the Criminal Code  and at common law, but is expressly
laid and the commitment made under the Criminal Code , is the commitment made
thereunder a commitment in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of
Canada within the meaning of section 57 of the Supreme Court Act?

Dealing with the first of these
questions I incline to the view that the argument on behalf of the accused is
sound. That there is considerable authority for the view adopted by my brother
Newcombe I admit. That view was taken by Gwynne J. in In re Boucher[13]
, where that learned judge said :

The decision of the Court of
Appeal should be considered conclusive, and should not be interfered with by a
single judge of any court sitting in chambers, but the applicant must be left
to any recourse he might have against the adjudication of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario.

This view was also given effect
to by Sedgwick J. in In re Patrick White[14]
, and by Girouard J. in In re Charles Seely[15]
. These views, however reasonable they may be, seem to me to be inconsistent
with the judgment of the House of Lords in Cox v. Hakes[16]
, where Lord Halsbury, at page 514, said :

My Lords, probably no more
important or serious question has ever come before your Lordships' House. For a
period extending as far back

[Page 585]

as our legal history, the
writ of habeas corpus has been regarded as one of the most important safeguards
of the liberty of the subject. If upon the return to that writ it was adjudged
that no legal ground was made to appear justifying detention, the consequence
was immediate release from custody. If release was refused, a person detained
might—see Ex parte Partington[17]
, make a fresh application to every judge or every court in turn, and each
court or judge was bound to consider the question independently and not to be
influenced by the previous decisions refusing discharge. If discharge followed,
the legality of that discharge could never be brought in question.

In the same case Lord Herschell
at page 527, said :—

It was always open to an
applicant for it, if defeated in one court, at once to renew his application to
another. No court was bound by the view taken by any other, or felt itself
obliged to follow the law laid down by it. Each court exercised its independent
judgment upon the case, and determined for itself whether the return to the
writ established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the
law. A person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until
he obtained his liberty.

Again in Eshugbayi Eleko v.
Government of Nigeria[18]
, the Privy Council, at page 442, said:—

If it be conceded that any
judge has jurisdiction to order the writ to issue, then in the view of their
Lordships each judge is a tribunal to which application can be made within the
meaning of the rule and every judge must hear the application on the merits.

The writ of habeas corpus ad
subjiciendum is a prerogative process for securing the liberty of the
subject by affording an effective means of immediate release from unlawful or
unjustifiable detention, whether in prison or in private custody. It is a
prerogative writ by which the King has a right to inquire into the causes for
which any of his subjects are deprived of their liberty. 10 Halsbury, 39.

The law of England has
always been very jealous of any infringement of personal liberty and has been
most assiduous in its preservation. In view of the fact that the great object
of the writ is to give the person restrained of his liberty an immediate
hearing so that the legality of his contention may be inquired into and
determined, and in view of the statements contained in the judgments above
quoted, I am led to the conclusion that a judge of this court, on an
application for a writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the validity of
a commitment by which a person is detained in custody, has cast upon him the
duty of determining for himself whether such detention is in accordance with
the law. In giving effect to his own view as to the validity of the detention I
am unable to see how the judge

[Page 586]

can be said to be reviewing the
conclusion of a provincial court of appeal. He is merely exercising the primary
jurisdiction vested in him. This I think is clear from the language of Lord
Bramwell in the Cox case[19] ,
where, at page 523, his Lordship said:—

I cannot agree that going
first to a judge of one court, and then, on being refused by the judge, going
to a court, and, on being refused by one court, going to another, was or is an
appeal. The court applied to after refusal by a judge or other court was not
exercising an appellate jurisdiction in entertaining the application. It was
exercising a primary jurisdiction.

The concurrent jurisdiction
exercised by a judge of this court is jurisdiction to issue the writ for the
purpose of inquiring into the validity of the commitment. That such
jurisdiction does not oblige him to accept the view of the Court of Appeal in
any province is, I think, clear when we consider the position he would be in if
the Court of Appeal in some other province had interpreted the sections of the
Criminal Code  in question in this appeal as meaning something different from
the meaning placed upon them by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and an
application were made by the person convicted in each province for a writ of habeas
corpus. Could a judge of this court say to the petitioner from one province
that the relevant sections of the Code mean one thing in his province, and to
the other that the same sections mean, in his province, something entirely
different? In my opinion, he could not. It is obvious that the sections of the
Code must be construed the same way for all provinces by a judge of this court.
This consideration, in my opinion, makes it impossible to hold that he is bound
by the construction placed upon the particular sections by any provincial court
of appeal.

So far as this particular case is
concerned the point is not of vital importance because the accused have taken
advantage of section 57 (2), above quoted, and have appealed to this court, and
no one suggests that this court is bound by the view of the Court of Appeal.
Our duty is to state what, in our opinion, is the true interpretation of the
sections.

Counsel for the Crown, however,
has raised a preliminary objection to our jurisdiction to pass upon the merits
of the

[Page 587]

appeal. He puts forward the
contention that the appellants were not ""committed"" in a criminal
case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada. His argument is that the
offence of attempting to steal was an offence at common law in British Columbia
prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code  and that the jurisdiction of a
judge of this court, under section 57 of the Supreme Court Act, is
limited to cases in which the offence charged was not an offence in the
province at common law or under a pre-confederation statute but became a
criminal offence solely by virtue of the provisions of an Act of the Parliament
of Canada. In support of his contention he cited the following cases: In
re Sproule[20]
; In re Roberts[21]
; In re Dean[22]
; and Doherty v. Hawthorne[23] .

With reference to these
authorities, only one, the Dean case[24] , in
my opinion, is in point, although dicta may be found in the others which
support the argument.

The case of In re Sproule[25]
was tried in 1886, before the enactment of the Criminal Code  which came into
force in 1892. The charge was murder. At the date of the conviction there was
no Dominion statute making murder a crime. It was a crime at common law and the
common law had been introduced into the province of British Columbia, but the
only existing Dominion statute dealing with offences against the person (32 and
33 Vict. c. 20), dealt merely with the punishment and not with the offence. As
there was no Act of the Parliament of Canada at that time which made murder a
criminal offence there was no jurisdiction in a judge of this court to
entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus, as the court held.

In the case of In re Roberts[26]
the appellant was in custody at Quebec under the authority of a special Act of the
legislature for an alleged offence against the privileges, honour and dignity
of the provincial legislature of Quebec. It was an offence under a provincial law and, as
the present Chief Justice of this court pointed out on an application to him
for a writ of habeas corpus, there was

no ground whatever for
suggesting that it was a crime under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

In Doherty v. Hawthorne[27] , the petitioner was confined in the common gaol in
the county of York, N.B.,

[Page 588]

under a warrant of commitment
following his conviction for selling intoxicating liquor contrary to section 56
of the Intoxicating Liquor Act—a provincial statute. He made an
application for a writ of habeas corpus to Mr. Justice Mignault of this
court, in chambers. That learned judge dismissed the application on the gound
that the commitment was made under a provincial statute and not under an Act of
the Parliament of Canada and he had, therefore, no jurisdiction. An appeal was
taken to this court which affirmed the dismissal of the application for the
reasons given by Mr. Justice Mignault.

None of these cases, in my
opinion, are any authority for the contention made here by counsel for the
Crown, for in none of them was the offence, for which the petitioner was
committed, a criminal offence under a Dominion statute at the date of the
conviction.

The case of In re Dean[28],
is, however, squarely in point. In that case the petitioner had been tried and
convicted of house breaking and committed to gaol. He made an application to my
brother Duff in chambers for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. My
learned brother dismissed the application on the ground that as a judge of this
court he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application. He held that the
jurisdiction given to a judge of the court by section 57 (then s. 62) of the Supreme
Court Act was limited to those cases in which the ""commitment""
has followed upon a charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by
virtue of some statute of the Parliament of Canada and did not extend to cases
in which the

""commitment"" is
for an offence which was an offence at common law or under a statute which was
passed prior to Confederation and is still in force.

With great deference I find
myself unable to so construe the language of section 57. To give a judge of
this court jurisdiction there must be a ""commitment"" and that
commitment must be made in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of
Canada. That is the language of the section. In this case the appellants were committed.
Their commitments followed on a charge of attempting to steal. Attempting to
commit theft is an indictable offence

[Page 589]

under the Criminal Code  (ss. 386 
and 773 ) for which an accused person with his consent may be tried summarily.
It is also an offence at common law. Section 15  of the Criminal Code  provides:

15. Where an act or omission
constitutes an offence, punishable on summary conviction or on indictment,
under two or more Acts, or both under an Act and at common law, the offender
shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and
punished under either or any of such Acts, or at common law, but shall not be
liable to be punished twice for the same offence.

This section makes it clear that
the appellants might have been prosecuted and punished either at common law or
under the Code. Both the charge and the commitment, however, shew that they
were prosecuted and convicted for the offence of unlawfully attempting to steal
""contrary to the Criminal Code ."" As the Criminal Code  is a Dominion
statute I am of opinion that the appellants were committed ""in a criminal
case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada."" The fact that they might
have been tried and punished for the offence at common law is, to my mind,
immaterial, for they were not so tried and punished. The appellants, therefore,
are entitled to have the merits of their appeal determined.

In view of the conclusion reached
by the other members of the court that we have no jurisdiction to hear this
appeal on the merits, it is unnecessary that I should consider the merits at
greater length than to say that I find myself in accord with the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Martin in his dissenting judgment in the court below,
and that the sentence should be reduced to imprisonment for six months.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Charge of shop breaking by
night with intent to assault—Cr. C, s.
461—Omission in charge of essential allegation to constitute
the crime—Power of amendment (Cr. C.,
s. 889(2))—Evidence—Conviction quashed.

Appellants were convicted, in the County
Court Judge’s Criminal Court, on a charge of breaking and entering by night the
shop of C. P. “with intent to
commit an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one C. P. contrary to the form of statute in that behalf made and
provided”. The trial judge’s finding against each appellant was “[appellant]
tried this day on a charge of shop breaking by night with intent.

[Page 506]

Found guilty.” On appeal it was objected that
in the charge the word “therein” was omitted (after the word “offence”) and
therefore the charge as laid did not come within s. 461, Cr.
Code, and constituted no
offence in law. The Crown contended that the objection was not open, as an
amendment could have been made under s. 889(2), and, under s. 898, every
objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof must be
taken by demurrer or motion to quash the indictment, before pleading.

Held: S.
889(2), by its terms, provides for amendment only where “the matter omitted is
proved by the evidence”; and there was no evidence to indicate that appellants
broke or entered with’ any intent to assault C. P., “therein” or elsewhere,
although there was evidence possibly justifying an inference of breaking in
with intent to assault her son A. P. The charge, intended to be of an offence
under s. 461, lacked an allegation essential to constitute the crime, namely,
that the intent was to commit the assault (that is, on C. P., as charged) in
the shop that was broken into; and there was no evidence that supplied this
omission, so as to give foundation for an amendment under s. 889(2) that would
make it in reality a charge under s. 461. Without amendment, and without proof
of the crime intended to be described, there was a finding of guilty of the
charge, as set out, which did not describe any crime. The conviction must
therefore be quashed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia en banc, sitting as a Court of Appeal under the
provisions of the Criminal Code , dismissing (Mellish and Ross JJ.
dissenting) the present appellants’ appeal from their conviction by Crowe, Co.
C.J., at a sittings of the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court for District No.
7, sitting at Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, on the charge
for that they “at New Waterford in
the county of Cape Breton on or about the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1930, did
wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night the shop of Selina Passerini, there situated with intent to commit
an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one Celina
Passerini contrary to the form of Statute in that
behalf made and provided”.

The material facts of the case and the issues
in question are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal
was allowed and the conviction quashed.

J. W. Maddin, K.C., for the appellants.

Neil R. M сArthur, К.С., for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Smith, J.—The three appellants were tried in the County Court Judge’s
Criminal Court of District No. 7,

[Page 507]

county of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, on the
following charges:

* * * for that they, the said Ignatius
McNeil, William McNeil and Dennis McNeil, at New Waterford
in the county of Cape Breton on or about the 22nd day
of November, A.D. 1930, did wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night
the shop of Celina Passerini there
situated with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one Celina Passerini contrary to the form of
Statute in that behalf made and provided.

That they, the said Ignatius McNeil,
William McNeil and Dennis McNeil, at New Waterford in the county of Cape Breton, on or about the 22nd day of November,
A.D. 1930, did wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night the dwelling
house of Celina Passerini, there
situated with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, assault upon one Celina Passerini contrary to the form of
Statute in that behalf made and provided.

The accused elected to be tried by the judge
without a jury, and the trial proceeded on the charges as above set out. The
minute of election, as set out at page 34 of the record, is as follows:—

The accused having been brought up for
election on the charge that they did, on or about the 22nd day of November,
A.D. 1930, at New Waterford in
Cape Breton county, unlawfully break and enter by night the dwelling house of
Mrs. Celina Passerini with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein contrary to the form of Statute in that
behalf made and provided;

Elected to be tried under the “Speedy
Trials Act”.

It is to be noted that the word “therein”
appears in this minute after the words “indictable offence”, but does not
appear in the two charges set out. The record contains no minute of election as
to the first charge.

The minute of trial sets out that the accused,
on being arraigned on the following accusation, each pleaded not guilty, and
the accusations are then set out in the same language as stated above.

The finding of the trial judge is as follows:—

Ignatius McNeil tried this day on a charge
of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.

William McNeil tried this day on a charge
of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.

Dennis McNeil tried this day on a charge of
shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.

Ignatius McNeil was sentenced to six months in
the common gaol, William McNeil to two years in the Dorchester penitentiary,
and Dennis McNeil to two years and six months in the Dorchester penitentiary.

The accused appealed to the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia against the conviction, and the appeal was dismissed by a majority
of three to two.

[Page 508]

The intention
evidently was to charge the accused parties with an offence under sec. 461 
of the Criminal Code , and
with an offence under sec. 462  of the Criminal Code , which read as follows:—

461. Breaking Shop, etc., with Intent.—Every one is guilty
of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, either by
day or night, breaks and enters any of the buildings, or any pen, cage, den or
enclosure mentioned in the last preceding section with intent to commit any
indictable offence therein.

462. Being Found in Dwelling-House at Night.—Every one is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who
unlawfully enters, or is in, any dwelling-house by night with intent to commit any
indictable offence therein.

The ground of
appeal is that in each charge the word "" therein "" is omitted, and
that therefore the charges as laid do not come within the sections referred to,
and constitute no offence in law.

The Crown
contends that this objection is not open to the accused, because an amendment
could have been made under sec. 889(2)  of the Criminal Code , and that under sec. 898  every objection to any indictment for
any defect apparent on the face thereof must be taken by demurrer, or motion to
quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards;
and, under subs. 2, no
motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for any defect in the indictment
which might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, or amended under
authority of this Act. Section 889(2)  reads as follows:

If it appears * * * that there is in the indictment, or in
any count in it, an omission to state or a defective statement of anything requisite
to constitute the offence, or an omission to negative any exception which ought
to have been negatived, but that the matter omitted is proved by the evidence,
the court before which the trial takes place, if of opinion that the accused
has not been misled or prejudiced in his defence by such error or omission,
shall amend the indictment or count as may be necessary.

It is contended
that this section does not authorize an amendment that would change a charge
that does not allege or describe any crime into a charge describing a crime,
and that, in any case, there was no amendment here; so that  the conviction is
really on the charge as laid, that does not constitute a crime.

It is not
necessary here to determine the extent to which this section goes in the matter
of allowing amendments, because, by its terms, the amendment is only to be
made. where the matter omitted is proved by the evidence. It,

[Page 508]

therefore becomes
necessary to examine the evidence to ascertain if the matter omitted has been
proved; that is, to ascertain whether or not it has
been proved that the accused broke into the shop "" with intent to commit
therein an indictable offence, to wit, to
assault Celina Passerini"", or did enter the dwelling-house "" with
intent to commit an indictable offence therein,
to wit, assault upon one Celina Passerini "".

I have perused
the evidence very carefully from beginning to end, and I find no evidence
whatever that suggests any such intent. The evidence establishes that the three
accused broke in the door of Celina Passerini's shop a little after midnight,
when some members of her family and some visitors were sitting in the
dining-room, which is connected with the shop by a doorway, and when Celina Passerini,
her son Angelo and some boarders were in bed upstairs. Celina Passerini came
downstairs, and the following is her evidence as to what happened when she was standing
on the step:—

Q. What happened when
you were standing on the step?

A. Dennis McNeil was there with beer
bottles in his hand, and he said, "" Where is your - - - son? He won't live
more than five minutes if I get him."" And he make a spring to get by me
and then he took a top off the stove and struck me on the leg.

On
cross-examination, she states that when she came downstairs the three McNeils,
her daughter Irene, Peter Guthro, one Dickson and Jack McKeigan were there in
the dining room. The other McNeil boys were right behind, one leaning against
the wall. The examination proceeds as follows:—

Q. Who was leaning
against the wall, which one was it?

A. Iggy, Ignatius there.

Q. Where were the other fellows?

A. Trying to get upstairs.

Q. Did they have bottles?

A. Yes, when they came in.

She states that
they had a lot of bottles; that Dennis had one in each hand, and some in his
pockets, and that he placed two on the table. Then we have the following:—

Q. You say they have
two bottles?

A. Not all; and they attempt to come upstairs. I tells him he is not going upstairs and then he pick up
the piece of the stove and throw at me, the iron.

Irene Passerini
is asked what accused came for, and answers, ""Looking for Angelo "".
This is all there is in reference to an assault.

[Page 510]

I think it is not possible to infer from this
evidence that the premises were entered with the intention of committing an
assault upon Celina Passerini. It
indicates, I think, quite the contrary, namely, that the accused Dennis McNeil
for the first time formed in his own mind alone an intent to assault Celina Passerini at the time she prevented him
from going upstairs, because she so prevented him. Although she says “they
attempted to come upstairs”, it appears that only Dennis McNeil made such
attempt, because she goes on to say, “I tells him he is not going upstairs”;
and she has said just before that Ignatius was leaning against the wall; and in
her examination in chief she referred to Dennis only as having tried to go
upstairs. There is nothing to indicate that there was in the mind of any of the
accused, at the time of breaking in, an intent to assault Celina
Passerini, in the shop oľ elsewhere.

The enquiry addressed to her by the accused
Dennis McNeil as to the whereabouts of her son, the threat made in reference to
him, and the spring made to get past Celina Passerini on the stair, which she swears to, is evidence of an intent on the
part of Dennis McNeil at that time to make an assault on her son, Angelo Passerini, and possibly might justify an
inference that he broke in with that intent, and might possibly also justify
the further inference that all three were acting with a common intent; but this
is not a matter that arises for consideration here.

The meaning of the learned judge’s finding, as I
read it, is that all three accused broke into the shop with the intention of
committing an assault as charged, that is, on Celina
Passerini. He could not have had in mind an intent to
commit an assault on anyone else, because there is no suggestion in the charges
of an attempt to commit an assault on anyone but Celina
Passerini. The particular place where accused intended
to make the assault is not involved in the finding of guilty, because no
particular place was alleged in the charge, and the finding is simply “guilty”.
We therefore have what was intended to be a charge of an offence under sec. 461 
of the Criminal Code  which lacks an allegation essential to constitute
the crime

[Page 511]

described in that section, namely, that the
intent was to commit the assault in the shop that was broken into. There was no
evidence that supplies this omission. It was after midnight, and the shop was
closed. The accused first rapped at the back door of the dwelling part of the
premises. There is nothing to warrant an inference that the intent at the time
of breaking in was to assault Celina Passerini in the shop so as to give foundation for an amendment pursuant to
sec. 889 (2)  that would make it in reality a charge under sec. 461 .

Without any amendment of this charge, which
really does not describe any crime, and without any evidence that would amount
to proof of the crime intended to be described in the first charge, there is a
finding of guilty of this charge, as set out, that does not describe any crime.

If it is attempted to uphold the conviction on
the ground that the accused might have been held guilty, on the evidence, of a
charge under sec. 462 , that is, of unlawfully entering or being in a dwelling
house by night with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, to wit, an
assault on Angelo Passerini, the
obvious answer is that, even if an amendment to that effect could have been
made under sec. 889 (2) , there is no conviction for that offence.

If the learned judge’s finding as recorded can
be construed as a conviction under sec. 461 of the Code, there was in reality
no charge before him under that section, and no evidence that proved an offence
under that section. The appeal must therefore be allowed, and the conviction
quashed.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Cr. Code, s. 1023—“Question of law”—Trial judge’s charge to
jury.

The general appellate jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of Canada is confined to civil matters; to found an appeal to the
Court in any criminal matter, resort must be had to some special statutory
provision enacted by the Dominion Parliament. Save for the special case
provided for by s. 1025, Cr. C., the only right of appeal to the Court
in any criminal cause is that conferred by s. 1023, Cr. C. For an appeal
to come within s. 1023, the conviction must have been affirmed by the court
below and there must have been dissent by some member thereof on a question of
law.

The present appeal was from the judgment of
the Appellate Division, Ont., 40 Ont. W.N., 71,[1]
affirming appellant’s conviction for murder, two judges dissenting on what the
order of the court declared (apparently in accordance with former subs. 5 of s.
1013, Cr. C., but which subsection had been repealed by s. 28 of c.
11, 1930) to be questions of law. In the opinion of some of the members of this
Court, this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because, in their
view, the grounds of dissent below were not on any question of law, but only on
matters which it was competent for the jury to pass upon and which depended
entirely upon an appreciation of the weight of evidence in regard to the points
discussed. But the ground taken (unanimously) for dismissal of the appeal was
that it failed on the merits, as the reasons for dissent below did not, on
examination of the matters dealt with therein and of the trial judge’s charge
as a whole, shew justification for setting aside the conviction.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[2],
dismissing the appellant’s appeal against his conviction, on trial before
Jeffery J. and a jury, for the murder of one Samuel Goldberg at Toronto. In the
Appellate Division, Mulock, C.J.O., and Grant, J.A., dissented from the
judgment of the majority of the court, and held that the summing up by the
trial judge in his charge to the jury was not fair to the accused

[Page 422]

and might have caused a miscarriage of
justice, and that, therefore, the conviction should be quashed and a new trial
directed.

By the judgment now reported the appeal to this
Court was dismissed.

I.F. Hellmuth K.C. for the appellant.

E. Bayly K.C. and W.B. Common for the
respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—This Court was created by the
Dominion Parliament in 1875 as a “General Court of Appeal for Canada” by
virtue of the power conferred by section 101 of the British North
America Act. Purely statutory in its origin,—although the Court is, by the
Supreme Court Act, declared to be a court of law and equity, and, by
section 35 of that Act, is constituted an appellate court with “civil and
criminal jurisdiction within and throughout Canada”—by section 36,
criminal causes are expressly excluded from its appellate jurisdiction. It
follows that the general appellate jurisdiction of this Court is confined to
civil matters and that, as provided for by section 44 of the Act, resort
must be had to some special statutory provision enacted by the Dominion
Parliament to found an appeal to the Court in any criminal matter. Such a
provision is made by section 1023  of the Criminal Code , which reads
as follows:

Any person convicted of any indictable
offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under
section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there
has been dissent in the Court of Appeal. * * *

Save the special case provided for by
section 1025 of the Code, I know of no other right of appeal in any
criminal cause to this Court than that conferred by section 1023 .

Two conditions must exist in order that an
appeal may come within section 1023 , viz., the conviction must have been affirmed
by the court below, and there must have been dissent by some member of that
court on a question of law. In the present case, the conviction was affirmed by
a majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme

[Page 423]

Court of Ontario[3],
two of its members dissenting on what the order of the court declared to be
questions of law. Such a declaration was formerly necessary under
section 1013 (5) (Davis v. The King[4]),
and, notwithstanding the repeal of that provision in 1930 (Statutes of Canada,
1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28), is found in the order presently before the
Court. Presumably, the repeal of subsection 5 escaped the notice of the
Registrar and of the solicitors for the Crown and for the defendant who are
responsible for the wording of the order; otherwise, it is difficult to account
for the presence of the declaratory provision referred to. At all events, it is
not binding upon us.

At the threshold of the present appeal, we are
confronted with the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain it,
which depends upon whether or not the dissent rests upon “any question
of law” within the meaning of section 1023  of the Criminal Code . Although
notice of application for leave to appeal was given, the record before the
Court contains nothing, save a passing reference to it by Hodgins J.A., to shew
that such application was actually made, or as to its disposition. The appeal
to the Appellate Division should probably, therefore, be regarded as having
been confined to the subject matter of clause (a) of section 1013 ,
which enables an appeal to be taken de piano “on any ground of appeal
which involves a question of law alone.” Prima facie, the words “any
question of law” found in section 1023 of the Code should be read as
referring to “any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone,” as
set out in clause (a) of section 1013 , and should receive the same
construction as that obviously applicable to that clause, i.e., the grounds of
appeal to this Court must be confined to “questions of law alone,” the appeal
to this Court under section 1023  being likewise de piano.

However that may be, some of my learned brothers
are of the opinion that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal
because they are unable to find any question of law whatever in the grounds of
dissent stated by the Chief Justice of Ontario, in which Mr. Justice Grant
agreed, their

[Page 424]

view being that all matters dealt with by the
learned Chief Justice are really matters which it was competent for the jury to
pass upon, and depend entirely upon an appreciation of the weight of evidence
in regard to the several points discussed. Personally, I am inclined strongly
to this view.

But it seems unnecessary to dispose of the case
on this ground, having regard to our view upon the merits in respect to which
we are unanimous.

Assuming that there may be one or more points of
law involved in the grounds of dissent, a careful examination of those grounds
and the evidence referred to in them, and of the entire record, including the
charge of the learned trial judge as a whole, has satisfied us that, while that
charge may not have been ideally perfect, in that the learned judge (as was not
at all improper) shewed, especially by his adverse comments on the evidence
offered in support of the defence of alibi, that he had been more favourably
impressed by the Crown’s case than by that of the defence, the meticulous
criticism made by the Chief Justice of Ontario of that charge cannot be
justified. The defence of alibi was the main, if not the sole, defence raised
at the trial and the evidence in support of it was fully presented to the jury,
accompanied, it is true, by some comments, which may or may not have
discredited that evidence. Such comments, if they had such a tendency, were quite
within the competence of the trial judge and did not amount to a withdrawal of
the issue as to alibi, or of any evidence in support of it from the
consideration of the jury. On the contrary, they were told more than once by
the learned trial judge that that issue, and the evidence offered in support of
it, were matters exclusively for their consideration.

It is true that the learned Chief Justice
concludes his judgment by stating that the charge, as a whole, was unfair to
the accused, but he qualified that statement by adding, “For the reasons above
mentioned.” Examining these reasons one by one, we fail to find therein
anything amounting to a withdrawal of any evidence from the jury, or any
direction to the jury contrary to law. On the contrary, while criticising the
evidence offered by the defence, at times, perhaps, somewhat severely, the
learned trial

[Page 425]

judge was always careful to add to his
observations of that character a clear statement that the several matters so
discussed were wholly for the jury to consider, both as to the credibility of
the evidence offered thereupon, and the inferences to be drawn from it.

As Mr. Justice Middleton said,

Here the charge of the learned Trial Judge
is saturated from beginning to end with repeated statements that the weight and
effect of evidence is for the jury and for the jury alone, and that the onus is
always upon the Crown and that the prisoner is always entitled to the benefit
of any doubt that has been raised in their minds.

Indeed, in connection with his comments upon the
defence of alibi in particular, after devoting remarks, which cover several
pages of the record, to a discussion of the evidence offered in support
thereof, the learned trial judge proceeded to add that, if proved to their
satisfaction, that defence would be a complete answer to the Crown’s case, but
he was careful to say in the very next sentence that, if any reasonable doubt
remained in the minds of the jury on further consideration, the defendant was
entitled to the benefit of such doubt.

Upon the whole case, therefore, we are of the
opinion that the appeal fails.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Trial by jury—Motion to withdraw the case
before verdict—Sufficiency of the evidence adduced—Proper order as to a new
trial. Arts. 469, 495, 1248 C.C.P.

APPEAL by the defendant appellant from the
decision of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior
Court, Duclos J., and ordering a new trial.

The plaintiff (respondent), the widow of one
Charles Quirion, claimed compensation for the death of her husband, caused, as
she alleged, by the defendant ((appellant) company’s negligence. He was struck
by one of the company’s tram cars while attempting to cross its tracks in
Montreal, and thereby received injuries from which he died soon after. At the
trial, which took place before

[Page 599]

Duclos J. and a special jury, the plaintiff
presented her case, and the defendant then moved that the case be withdrawn
from the jury and that the action be dismissed, upon the ground that the
plaintiff had introduced no evidence upon which the jury could find a verdict.
The Court granted this motion. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, which was unanimous in the view that there was evidence to go to the
jury. But the order for a new trial, as framed by the appellate court, directed

que la cause soit remise devant le tribunal de
première instance dans l’état où
elle se trouvait, au moment où la susdite motion a été faite, et pour qu’il
soit procédé suivant la loi.

A. Vallée K.C. for
the appellant.

J. P. Lanctot for
the respondent.

The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the view of
the judges of the appellate court that the trial judge erred in withdrawing the
case from the jury and in dismissing the action, and that there was evidence
which he should have submitted for the jury’s consideration; and the appeal was
dismissed with costs. But the court added that “a question arose at the
argument as to the form of the order” for a new trial as made by the appellate
court, and “attention was directed to the difficulty of continuing the
proceedings before the tribunal of first instance in the state in which (they were) when the defendant company
launched its motion. In order to comply (with such order), it would seem
necessary to resume the proceedings before the judge, and with the special
jury, who functioned on the former occasion, and it would be inconvenient, or
perhaps impossible, to satisfy these requirements, the judgment at the trial
having been given more than a year ago.” This Court therefore varied the
judgment appealed from “by substituting for the clause (above) quoted a
direction to the effect that a new trial shall be had between the parties.”

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conviction for conspiracy in
restraint of trade—Unanimous judgment—Motion for leave to appeal—Alleged
conflict with other decisions of appellate court—Sections 498, 1025 Cr. C.

The appellants seek leave to appeal from an
unanimous judgment of the appellate court in Quebec dismissing their appeal
from their conviction on an indictment laid against them under section 498 Cr.
C., which deals with conspiracies in restraint of trade; and the question at
issue in this appeal is whether that section is within the legislative
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.

Held that
leave to appeal cannot be granted as the judgment appealed from does not
conflict with the judgment of any other appellate court in a like case. (S.
1025 Cr. C.).

MOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada, under section 1025  of the Criminal Code , from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec upholding the
conviction of the appellants on an indictment laid against them under section
498  of the Criminal Code .

Forsyth for the
motion.

Bertrand K.C. contra.

Mignault J.—This is a petition by the appellants for leave to appeal, under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code  (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36), from a judgment of the Court of King’s Bench (Quebec)
dismissing their appeal from their conviction on an indictment laid against
them under section 498  of the Criminal Code , which deals with conspiracies in
restraint of trade.

Following their conviction, the appellants
brought two appeals to the Court of King’s Bench, one on questions of law
alone, and the other on questions stated to be of mixed law and fact. On the
latter appeal one of the learned judges dissented, and a further appeal has
been brought to this Court and is now pending. The appeal on questions of law
alone was unanimously rejected, and the object of this application is to seek
leave to appeal on the question whether section 498  of the Criminal Code  is
within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.

Such leave cannot be granted unless the judgment
to be appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in
a like case (s. 1025 Cr. C.). The petitioners rely on three cases which they
say are in conflict with the decision of the Court of King’s Bench: Attorney-General
for Ontario v. Canadian Wholesale Grocers Association[1]; Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General
of Alberta[2]; Fort
Frances Pulp & Paper Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co.[3].

The first case was a decision of the Appellate
Division of Ontario, Meredith C.J.O. and Magee, Hodgins and Ferguson JJ.A.
Subject to a further reference to this decision,

[Page 404]

I may say that, on the point in question, the
constitutionality of section 498 , one only of the learned judges, the Chief
Justice, was of the opinion that section 498  was ultra vires. Magee
J.A., concurred in the result; Hodgins J.A., expressed the view that section
498  was not ultra vires, and Ferguson J.A., found it unnecessary to
consider the constitutionality of that section, inasmuch as, in his judgment,
the appeal failed on the merits. There was therefore no pronouncement of the
appellate court on this question, and therefore there is no conflict.

Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorney-General of Alberta[4],
which I will call the Board of Commerce Case, is the well known decision of the
Judicial Committee whereby two statutes of the Dominion Parliament, The Board
of Commerce Act (9 and 10 Geo. V, c. 37), and The Combines and Fair
Prices Act (9 and 10 Geo. V, c. 45) were held to be ultra vires.

That this judgment of the Judicial Committee may
conceivably lend support to the contention that section 498  of the Criminal
Code  transcends the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion, is shewn by the
judgment of Chief Justice Meredith in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Canadian
Wholesale Grocers Association[5].
Nevertheless, upon full consideration, I do not think I can say that the Board
of Commerce Case is a like case within the meaning of section 1025  Cr. C. The
question there arose on a case stated by the Board of Commerce, under section
32 of The Board of Commerce Act, for the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Canada. The Judicial Committee, on appeal from this court, answered in the
negative the question submitted by the Boards which was whether the Board had
lawful authority to make a certain order prohibiting retail dealers in clothing
in Ottawa from charging as profits more than a certain percentage on cost.
Section 498  of the Criminal Code  was not involved in the question submitted. I
do not think therefore that the petitioners can rely on the Board of Commerce
Case.

In my opinion, the third case referred to by the
petitioners, Fort Frances Pulp & Paper Co. v. Manitoba Free Press

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Evidence—Accomplice—Corroboration—Warning to jury— Duty of Judge—Dissenting
opinion

The appellant was convicted on an indictment
for manslaughter by performance of an illegal operation on one Alice Couture,
causing a miscarriage that resulted in her death and he was sentenced to
imprisonment for life. The appellant’s appeal to the Court of King’s Bench was
dismissed, but one judge dissented on the question of law as to whether or not
there was error on the part of the trial judge in not having warned the jury as
to the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the girl Couture,
an accomplice.

Held that the
appellant was  entitled to have a new trial.

Per Duff,
Mignault, Rinfret and Smith JJ.—Although there is no case in which it has been
explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is some
corroborative evidence to go to the jury, it necessarily follows from the
principle laid down in the cases referred to in the judgment now reported,
where the evidence of the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and
the corroborative evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the
jury. In this case, there was in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to
be submitted to the jury, and it was the duty of the trial judge to have given
the warning. It is not, however, to be taken that the warning would have been
unnecessary, had there been some corroborative evidence

[Page 376]

proper to be submitted to the jury. It is for
the jury to say whether or not the corroborative evidence is to be believed,
and if it is not believed by the jury, and yet they convict, no warning having
been given, they are convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the
accomplice without having been warned of the danger of doing so. On that ground
and also in view of other improper evidence having been introduced at the
trial, it cannot be said that the appellant has suffered no substantial wrong.

Per Newcombe
J.—The evidence upon which the Crown relied for corroboration of the woman’s
testimony did not corroborate in the essential particulars; and there was no
warning to the jury, such as required by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the
well-known case of Rex vs. Baskerville ([1916] 2 K.B. 658).

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, criminal side, which had found the appellant guilty of
manslaughter upon the verdict of a jury.

The material facts of the case and its
questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

Alleyn Taschereau K.C. and J. M. Guérard for the appellant.

Valmore Bienvenue for the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the court (Duff,
Mignault, Rinfret and Smith J.J.) was declared by

Smith J.—The accused was convicted on an indictment for manslaughter by
performance of an illegal operation on one Alice Couture, causing a miscarriage
that resulted in her death on 29th June, 1927. The trial took place on the 3rd
day of November, 1927, and the accused was sentenced on the 8th of that month
to imprisonment for life. The fact of an illegal operation having been
performed causing the miscarriage that resulted in the young woman’s death was
clearly established, and the further question remaining for the jury was as to
whether or not the evidence established that the accused was the person who
performed the illegal operation.

On May 16th, 1927, the accused was arrested on a
charge, under section 303  of the Criminal Code , of using means to procure an
abortion on Alice Couture. On the same day

[Page 377]

the magistrate, Judge Lachance of the Court of
Sessions of the Peace, the clerk of the court and the crown solicitor attended
at the hospital to proceed with the preliminary enquête by taking the evidence
of Alice Couture, then lying there very ill. She testified that the accused had
performed the operation in question, giving details of what had happened. The
accused, then under arrest, was present at this hearing with his solicitor, who
cross-examined the witness on his behalf.

Alice Couture having died in the meantime, these
depositions were read at the trial to the jury as evidence against the accused,
after objection taken by his counsel to their admissibility had been over-ruled
by the trial judge.

The accused appealed from the conviction to the
Court of King’s Bench (in appeal), and the appeal was dismissed by a majority
judgment of that court, Justice Letourneau, with the permission of the court,
writing a dissenting judgment on the question of law raised as to whether or
not the learned trial judge had erred in not having warned the jury that it was
dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of Alice Couture, an accomplice.

By special leave[1]
the accused was allowed to also appeal on the question of whether the
depositions of Alice Couture, mentioned above, should have been admitted as
evidence against the accused on his trial for manslaughter.

Dealing first with the latter ground, it was
argued that, it having been shewn that Alice Couture was at the time
dangerously ill and, in the opinion of Dr. Marois, not likely to recover, the
method of taking her evidence under these circumstances is by commission, as
expressly laid down by sections 995  and 996  of the Criminal Code , and that it
could not be taken otherwise. If this argument were sound, the strong ground of
objection would seem to me to be that there was no commission, but what was
specially urged was that accused was not served with a written notice of the
intended taking of evidence as had been held by English courts to be necessary
under the corresponding sections of the English Act, citing Reg. v. Shurmer[2]; Rex v. Harris[3]; Rex v. Quigley[4]. As there was no written notice in this
case, it is urged that there is conflict on a

[Page 378]

question of law between the judgment of the
court below and the judgments in the English cases cited.

The Criminal Code , by section 999 , expressly
provides for reading the depositions of a witness taken at a preliminary
investigation against the accused at his trial for the same cause where the
witness has died in the meantime, and section 1000  provides that these depositions may also be read under the same
circumstances on his trial on any other charge. The depositions in question
were read as evidence under these sections and not as having been taken under
sections 995  and 996 , which have clearly no application. The appeal, therefore,
on this ground must be dismissed. We are not, however, passing on the question
of whether or not this is an appealable matter, even with leave.

Proceeding, then, to the other ground of appeal,
involving the question of law as to whether or not there was error on the part
of the learned trial judge in not having warned the jury as to the danger of
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of Alice Couture, an accomplice, it
is urged on behalf of the Crown that there was in fact corroborative evidence,
and that therefore such warning was not necessary.

The practice to be followed by a trial judge in
reference to the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice was carefully
considered and authoritatively laid down in the case of Rex v. Baskerville[5].

In the subsequent case of Rex v. Beebe[6], Lord Hewart, C.J., gives in a few words
the rule as laid down in the Baskerville case. He says the jury should be told

that it is within their legal province to
convict; they are to be warned in all such cases that it is dangerous to
convict; and they may be advised not to convict.

He points out that there is no reference to a
case in which it may be the duty of the learned judge to advise the jury in
such a case that they ought to convict, and further on states that such a
direction would not be according to the law laid down in the Baskerville Case5.

Following what Lord Hewart had thus laid down,
this court, in Rex v. Gouin[7],
set aside a conviction, although there was corroborative evidence where the
learned trial

[Page 379]

judge had told the jury that if they were quite
certain that the girl (an accomplice) was telling the truth, though
uncorroborated, they ought to act on it.

These cases, however, do not expressly lay down
what is necessary where there is some corroborative evidence. It is urged on
behalf of the accused that in this case there was in fact no corroborative
evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. Alice Couture had stated, in her
depositions read to the jury, that the accused had performed on her in the
previous year (1926) an illegal operation to procure a miscarriage, which
resulted at her sister’s house, and that she took the foetus to the accused.
The fact of the miscarriage, and of the placing of the foetus in a box
furnished by her “cavalier,” Adrien Letourneau, was testified to by the sister
Madame Turgeon. Blanche Pouliot testified to having been shewn the foetus in
this box at the house of Madame Turgeon, to having gone for a walk with Alice
Couture and to having seen the latter, after they had separated on the street,
go into the office of the accused, having with her this box. The question is:
Was this evidence of a previous crime committed by accused admissible

The leading case on this subject is Makin v.
The King. L.R. 1894 A. C., 57. The headnote gives the effect of the
decision in the following words:

Evidence tending to shew that the accused
has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment is
not admissible unless upon the issue whether the acts charged against the
accused were designed or accidental, or unless to rebut a defence otherwise
open to him.

This case and many others are reviewed in The
King v. Bond,[8], where
the charge was using instruments on Ethel Anne Jones on October 25th, 1905. It
was not disputed that accused had used instruments, the defence being that they
were used for a lawful purpose. Evidence was given by one Gertrude Taylor that
the accused had in January, 1905, used similar instruments on her to procure a
miscarriage. It was held by five of the judges that the evidence was admissible
as proof of intent, Alberstone, C.J., and Ridley, J., dissenting.

The subject is again discussed in the House of
Lords in Thompson v. The King[9],
which deals mainly with the

[Page 380]

application of the rule laid down in the
previous cases to the circumstances of the particular case under consideration.
In the present case there was no question of proving the intent of the accused
in performing an operation, the sole question being as to whether he was the
party who did perform it. All the evidence, therefore, offered to shew that
accused had performed an illegal operation on Alice Couture in 1926 was
inadmissible, and it need hardly be said that the evidence of J. Juneau, a
discharged servant who had been fined for an assault on the accused, of having
found the body of an infant behind a door on the accused’s premises about 1918,
was also inadmissible.

There remains the evidence of Adrien Letourneau,
described by Madame Turgeon as the “cavalier” of the deceased Alice Couture. He
says he regarded her as a girl of light morals, and that he was in the habit of
seeing her two or three times a week. He is the party who went with her to
Madame Turgeon’s when she had the miscarriage there in 1926, and he supplied
the box spoken of. His evidence, relied on as corroborative, is that in the
month of April, some short time before Alice Couture had the miscarriage in
question, in 1927, he went with her on two occasions, and parted with her not
far from the office of the accused, and saw her, on each occasion after parting
from him, enter the accused’s office. The accused testified that he had no
recollection of ever having seen Alice Couture, and that if he had seen her,
she was one of many who called in the course of a day, and had not impressed
herself on his memory. He, of course, denied all her statements about having
operated on her. He also testified about having been out of the city during
part of the month of April.

In the first place, the jury might on the
evidence before them have found that Letourneau was an accomplice, and if the
evidence was admissible, it should have been left to the jury to determine if
he was an accomplice, with a warning as to the danger of convicting on the
uncorroborated evidence of two accomplices. Rex v. Malouf[10]. Letourneau’s evidence was offered in chief
as proof of the crime, and was not corroborative because it did not tend to
implicate the accused in the commission of the crime. If it

[Page 381]

were true that the girl entered the office of
the accused as he stated, the evidence did not establish that she saw him or
implicate him in the commission of the crime.

A Morris chair, such as Alice Couture in her
depositions said had been used for the operation, and three instruments such as
doctors usually have in their office, with which an abortion might be brought
about, but with which, apparently, it would not be possible to cut up the
foetus as was done in this case, were found in the office of the accused. This
again would not be evidence tending to implicate the accused. It seems clear,
therefore, that there was in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to be
submitted to the jury, and that it was the undoubted duty of the learned judge
to have given the warning. It is not, however, to be taken that the warning
would have been unnecessary had there been some corroborative evidence proper
to be submitted to the jury. It is for the jury to say whether or not the
corroborative evidence is to be believed, and if it is not believed by the
jury, and yet they convict, no warning having been given, they are convicting
on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice without having been warned of
the danger of doing so. As stated, there seems to be no case in which it is
explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is some
corroborative evidence to go to the jury, but I think it necessarily follows
from the principle laid down in the cases referred to, where the evidence of
the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and the corroborative
evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the jury. This seems to be
assumed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Feighenbaum[11]. The appellant was convicted of inciting
boys to steal, the boys, accomplices, having given evidence against him. The
corroborative evidence was that of a police officer as to the conduct of the
accused when he interviewed him before proceedings and stated to him the names
of the boys and what they had related. Darling J. delivering the judgment of
the court, says:

In this case the deputy chairman rightly
directed the jury as to the danger of believing the uncorroborated evidence of
the accomplices, and as to what was, or might be, corroboration; and in our
opinion, it would

[Page 382]

in the circumstances of this case have been
wrong for him to say that in his opinion there was no corroboration of the boys’
evidence.

Here there was corroboration, and it is stated
that the jury were rightly warned.

In Baker v. The King[12], it seems also to have been assumed that
the warning should have been given, although there was the corroboration of
uncontroverted facts;

facts established by the admissions of the
appellants or by independent and unchallenged evidence.

The trial judge warned the jury that though they
might convict on the evidence of an accomplice, it would be dangerous to do so,
and warned them that one of the witnesses, Sowash, must be treated as an
accomplice, but failed to give the same warning as to the other witness,
Stromkins. One of the grounds of appeal was that the warning was not
sufficient, but there was in addition the objection that the learned trial
judge did not explain that corroboration means

corroboration not only in respect of some
fact tending to shew that the crime was committed, but also in respect of some
evidence implicating or tending to implicate the accused.

These objections were disposed of on the ground
that the accused suffered no substantial wrong. The failure to warn as to the
evidence of the accomplice Stromkins is commented on, but there is no
suggestion that the objection on that ground was untenable because there was
corroboration, doing away with the necessity of giving the warning.

Here the learned trial judge in substance said
to the jury: You have the evidence of Alice Couture, categorically relating
that the accused performed the illegal operation; you have confirmative
evidence of her story; and, on the other hand, you have the evidence of the
accused denying that he performed the operation. He has admitted that he was
convicted previously for a similar offence, which is a strong circumstance to
be taken into consideration in deciding whether you are to believe him or not.
It is a question, then, of which story you believe. If you believe the accused,
he is not guilty; if you don’t believe him, but believe Alice Couture, he is
guilty.

In addition to the defects of the charge, there
was the improper admission of evidence to which I have referred, and

[Page 383]

many other irregularities. The accused was put
in the box and testified as to his previous conviction and as to a long list of
subscriptions that he had since made for charitable and religious objects.
Presumably this was intended as evidence of good character, and was clearly
inadmissible as such or otherwise. It was made the basis for a
cross-examination of the accused on all the details of the previous offence and
on his subsequent conduct. A few sample questions will shew the character of
this cross-examination:—

Q. You remember that Miss Vachon said in
court in her evidence that you had worked in the same manner as in this case?
(Miss Vachon was the girl operated on in the former case.)

Counsel goes on in this way to repeat a great
part of the evidence given in the former trial.

The following are further samples:—

Q. Is it not true that at the time of your
condemnation in 1917 you were recognized as a public abortioner?

Q. Is it not true that you are recognized
as such at present by the public?

If the evidence of accused referred to had been
rejected, as it should have been, the cross-examination as to character would
have been limited to what was relevant on the question of his credibility. In
any case, the questions referred to should not have been allowed. The latter
two were, in effect, a declaration of fact by the Crown prosecutor to the jury.
The impropriety of introducing the evidence given by a witness on a previous
occasion by stating it to the accused and asking him if he remembers hearing
it, is pointed out in Allen v. The King[13].

It cannot be said that the accused suffered no
substantial wrong. The appeal is therefore allowed, and a new trial ordered.

Newcombe J.—I agree that there must be a new trial, because, in my view, the
evidence upon which the Crown relied for corroboration of the woman’s testimony
did not corroborate in the essential particulars; and there was no warning to
the jury, such as required by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the well-known
case of Rex v. Baskerville[14].

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Indictment—Formal charge in
writing setting forth offence —Description of offence—Insufficiency—Defects in
matters of sub-stance and essential averments omitted—Conspiracy—Overt act—Sub­stantial
wrong—Sections 852, 859, 878,
s.s. 5, Criminal Code.

Held insufficient
a count in a formal charge in writing (replacing in Quebec, a bill of
indictment before a grand jury no longer required in that province) that the
accused were parties ""to a seditious ""conspiracy in conspiring
together and with (other persons named ""and unknown), thereby committing
the crime of seditious conspir""acy,""

[Page 189]

such a charge containing defects in
matters of substance and essential averments having been wholly omitted.

Although conspiracy to commit a
crime, being in. itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone in an
indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it is
nevertheless necessary that a count charging conspiracy alone, without the setting
out of any overt act, should describe it in such a way as to contain in
sub-stance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is
charged, or, in other words, in such a way as to specify in sub-stance, the
specific transaction intended to be brought against the accused.

Under the terms of section 852 Cr.
C., which enacts an imperative requirement (""shall contain""), there
must be in the charge a statement that the accused has committed an indictable
offence; and such offence must be ""specified."" It will be sufficient
if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must contain such
statement ""in substance."" It will not be sufficient to merely
classify or characterize the offence; it is necessary to specify time, place
and matter and to state the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.
The statement ""may be made in popular language, without any tech­nical
averments"" or allegations; or it ""may be in the words of the
enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence""; but the statement must contain the allegations of
matter ""essential to be proved"" and must be in. ""words
sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged"" (ss. 2 and 3 of section 852 Cr. C.) : the main object of such
legislation being that an accused may have a fair trial and consequently that
the indictment shall, in itself, indentify with reasonable precision the act or
acts with which he is charged in order that he may be advised of the particular
offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellants, on their trial before Belleau J. and a jury, on a charge of having
been parties to a seditious conspiracy. The grounds of appeal, and the.
material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are
sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, the indictment
and the conviction were quashed.

R. L. Calder K.C. and Louis Lemay for
the appellants.

Gérard Lacroix K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RINFRET J.—The appellants were found guilty and con­victed in
the province of Quebec of having been parties to a seditious conspiracy. Upon
appeal, the verdict and

[Page 190]

conviction thereon were
unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side).

In the province of
Quebec (as well as in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and
British Colum­bia), it is no longer necessary to prefer a bill of indictment
before a grand jury; but it is sufficient that the trial of any person charged
with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in writing setting
forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged (Cr. Code, subs.
5 of sec. 873).

In the present case,
the charge was preferred by the Attorney-General and read as follows:

The Attorney-General of the province of
Quebec charges that: during the months of September and October in the year of
our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-three, at the city of Quebec, in
the district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec, George H. Brodie,
of Toronto, and G. C. Barrett, of Belleville, Ontario, were party to a
seditious conspiracy, in conspiring together and with one W. F. Greenwood, W.
G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons
unknown, thereby committing the crime of seditious conspiracy.

One of the grounds of
appeal to the Court of King's Bench was that this indictment was, on the face
of it, insufficient. That court, however, refused to entertain the objection
and to quash the indictment.

The appellants,
thereupon, alleging that the judgment appealed from conflicted with the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in a like case (to wit: Rex v. Buck[1]),
were granted leave to
appeal to this Court under section 1025  of the Criminal Code .

There can be no
question of the existence of the con­flict.

In the present case,
the whole indictment, and in the Buck case, the count objected to in the
indictment, charged the accused with being parties to a seditious con­spiracy.
In both cases, the time and place were mentioned, the accused were named and
all that was charged was that, at such time and place, the accused were
""parties to a seditious conspiracy."" In the present case, the
indictment adds:

in conspiring together and with one W. F.
Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs, A. M. Rose and also with
other persons unknown.

[Page 191]

It does not appear in
the report of the Buck case that the count there in issue contained a
similar mention. But otherwise the form of the charge was identical. In the
Quebec court of appeal, the indictment was held valid; in the Ontario Court of
Appeal, the count in the indictment was held invalid. It is evident that the
condition required by section 1025  of the Criminal Code  is met; and, leave
having been granted, an appeal lies to this Court.

It remains for us to decide
whether or not a charge pre­ferred in the form stated is sufficient under the
provisions of the Criminal Code .

The general provisions
as to counts and indictments are contained in ss. 852 & seq. of the Code;
and the funda­mental rule is laid down in s. 852 itself, which reads as follows:

852. Every count of
an indictment shall contain, and shall be sufficient if it contains in
substance, a statement that the accused has committed some indictable offence
therein specified.

2. Such statement may be made in popular
language without any technical averments or any allegations of matter not
essential to be proved.

3. Such statement may be in the words of
the enactment describing the offence or declaring the matter charged to be an
indictable offence, or in any words sufficient to give the accused notice of
the offence with which he is charged.

4. Form 64 affords examples of the manner
of stating offences.

This section has given
rise to a diversity of interpreta­tions, not only in the case immediately under
discussion and in the judgment of the Ontario court in Rex v. Buck[2] already adverted to,
but also in other decisions through-out the country. It has been stated by one
court that the requirement that a count shall state in substance that the
accused has committed some indictable offence therein specified has reference
to the particular kind of offence, such as distinguished from other kinds of
offences recog­nized by the law; that it was not directed to the specific acts
and things which constitute the offence alleged to have been committed
(Prendergast, J., in Rex. v. Kelly[3]);
while another court (Rex v. Trainor[4])
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta) thought it was clear the enactment
did not mean that it is sufficient to say that the accused did, on such a day,
"" commit theft,"" or

[Page 192]

""steal,"" or
"" did commit an assault with intent to rob,"" without specifying the
thing stolen, or identifying the person assaulted, not necessarily by name, but
in some way or other.

Such was decidedly the
view of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, as expressed in
its judg­ment in Rex v. Bainbridge[5],
where Magee, J.A., said (p. 222):

It is evident from subsec. 2 (of sec. 852)
that matter which is essential to be proved is not to be omitted, and from
subsec. 3 that the accused is to have notice of the offence and not merely of
the character or class of the offence; while subsec. 1 requires that there is
to be a substantial statement of an offence which, not the class of which, is
specified, and which must be an indictable one.

In the same case,
elute, J. said:

This (subsec. 1 of sec. 852) does not mean
merely naming an offence, as ""murder"" or ""theft,"" but the
offence itself must be specified.

And a little further:

The indictment must contain a valid count
identifying the charge.

The other judges of the
court agreed either with Magee, J.A., or with Clute, J.

Following the same
principle, the Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the Court of Appeal in
the Buck case[6] and, as
already mentioned, with reference to an indictment preferred in precisely the
same wording as in the present case, said that the count failed for
insufficiency; and the insufficiency was not cured by the furnishing of particulars showing matter which, if embodied in the
count, would have rendered the count adequate. He expressed the view that the
true functions of particulars was to give further information to the accused of
that which it was intended to prove against him, so that he may have a fair
trial; but it was not intended to be, in effect, the supple­menting of a
defective indictment by supplying that which ought to have appeared in the
indictment itself. He added:

This is very plain from the reading of sec.
859 of the Code (later to be referred to).

On the other hand, in
the judgment now appealed from, Bernier, J., thought

qu'il suffit que l'acte d'accusation
contienne en substance une déclaration que le prévenu a commis quelque acte
criminel et spécifié * * *

[Page 193]

chaque chef d'accusation doit décrire les
circonstances de l'infraction imputée, afin de permettre l'accusé de
reconnaître ce à quoi il se rapporte; néanmoins, ajoute l'article, l'absence ou
l'insuffisance de ces détails ne vicie pas le chef d'accusation.

He further said, it is
true:

Il est possible que l'acte d'accusation
aurait pu décrire en détails la conspiration séditieuse reprochée aux
appelants; chose bien certain e cependant, c'est que cette omission ne leur a
causé, et n.e pouvait leur causer aucun préjudice, aucun .substantial wrong; ils savaient parfaite-ment ce dont ils étaient accusés et ce pourquoi
ils allaient subir une enquête préliminaire suivie d'un procès.

And it is not possible
exactly to surmise how far the latter consideration influenced the decision of
the learned judge.

As for Walsh, J., who
spoke on behalf of the other members of the Court, he held the indictment
sufficient as the appellants were ""charged in the words of the Criminal
Code ."" The Crown had submitted and produced certain pamphlets distributed
by the accused, expressive of the seditious intention, and although no specific
passage in those pamphlets had been indicated by the Crown, this, in the
learned judge's view, was not necessary in this case

because no particular, but an ensemble constituted the offence.

The differences in the
legal interpretation of sec. 852 might also be traced in, among other cases: The
Queen v. Weir (No. 5)[7],
Wurtele, J.; Rex. v. Lemelin[8],
King's Bench (Quebec) appeal side; Le Roi
v. Beauvais &
Mon-tour[9];
Hatem v. Rex[10].

It has now become our
duty to decide the question.

If section 852 be
analysed, it will be noticed the impera­tive requirement ("" shall contain
"") is that there must be a statement that the accused has committed an
indictable offence; and such offence must be ""specified."" It will be
sufficient if the substance of the offence is stated; but every count must
contain such statement ""in substance."" In our view, this does not
mean merely classifying or char­acterizing the offence; it calls for the
necessity of specifying time, place and matter (Compare dictum of Channel, J.,
in Smith v. Moody[11]),
of stating the facts alleged to constitute the indictable offence.

The manner of stating
the matter is of no absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3.
The statement may be made in popular language, without any technical

[Page 194]

averments or
allegations; or it may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence
or declaring the matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the
latter parts of subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of
Parliament: the statement must contain the allegations of matter ""
essential to be proved,"" and must be in "" words sufficient to give
the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged."" Those are the
very words of the section; and they were put there to embody the spirit of the
legislation, one of its main objects being that the accused may have a fair
trial and consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with
reasonable pre­cision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that
he may be advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his
defence accordingly.

What Parliament
intended by using the words ""a statement * * * (of) some indictable
offence therein speci­fied,"" in subsection 1 of section 852 is, to our
mind, clearly illustrated by the ""examples of the manner of stating
offences"" given in Form 64, referred to in subsection 4 of section 852.

Under the Interpretation
Act (Ch. 1 of R.S.C., 1927), by force of sec. 31 (d):

wherever forms are prescribed, slight
deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead,
shall not invalidate them;

which obviously means
that any substantial deviation might be sufficient to invalidate the form used.
Now, a perusal of the examples given in Form 64 will be sufficient to indicate
that in no case is the manner of stating offences limited to the mere naming of
them, but in each case the act charged against the accused, though described in
the words of the enactment, is identified by specifying the time, the place and
the matter. We think the examples in Form 64 are referred to for the purpose of
indicating that they ought to be followed in substance. It is not sufficient in
a count to charge an indictable offence in the abstract. Con­crete facts of a
nature to identify the particular act which is charged and to give the accused
notice of it are necessary ingredients of the indictment. An accused person may
not be charged merely of having committed murder; the statement must specify
the matter. In the same way, in the present case, the appellants could not be
charged merely with having been ""parties to a seditious conspiracy,""
or

[Page 195]

having ""committed
the crime of seditious conspiracy."" The particular agreement between each
of them and "" with one W. F. Greenwood, W. G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton
and Mrs. A. M. Rose and also with other persons unknown"" into which they
are alleged to have entered and to which the Attorney-General gave the
appellation of "" seditious conspiracy "" ought to have been specified
in the charge prepared, either in popular language or in the words of the code,
in such a way as to show on its face that "" the matter charged ""
(subsection 2 of sec. 852) was an indict-able offence and as to apprise the
accused of the acts com­mitted by them for which they were called upon to
answer.

As a matter of fact,
this requirement of an indictment is further embodied in sec. 853  of the
Criminal Code , which enacts that

Every count * * * shall contain so much
detail of the circum­stances of the alleged offence as is sufficient to give to
the accused reason-able information as to the act or omission to be proved
against him and to identify the transaction referred to.

Such is the rule of the
Criminal Code .

Of course, it is
qualified by the proviso

that the absence or insufficiency of such
details shall not vitiate the count,

and it must be granted
that these words are very strong. It should be noticed, however, that the
proviso, as well as the section itself, relates only to the ""absence or
insuffi­ciency of details."" It does not detract from the obligation
resulting from sec. 852 that the substance of the offence should be stated in
the indictment.

Again do we find in
sec. 855 the confirmation of the construction which must be put on sec. 852, in
accordance with the views now expressed by us.

Sec. 855 is an
enumeration of instances where, notwith­standing the omission of certain
statements, the law says that

no count shall be deemed objectionable or
insufficient for the reason only

of this omission. A
mere perusal of the instances there given will show conclusively, to our mind,
that the require­ments of sec. 852 with regard to the ingredients which ""
every count of an indictment shall contain "" may not be restricted to the
mere naming of the offence charged, with-out specifying the substance of the
particular act com­plained of. If sec. 852 were to be construed in accordance

[Page 196]

with the contentions of
the Crown in the present case, the enumeration in sec. 855 of special
exceptions wherein cer­tain omissions are not to be deemed objectionable, or to
render the counts insufficient, would have been quite unnecessary.

Perhaps, in the
premises, it should be added that the Crown was unable to bring the indictment
within any of the enumerated exceptions, which makes it still clearer that the
indictment under discussion is insufficient. For example: Subsection (d) of
sec. 855 enacts that no count shall be deemed objectionable for the reason

that it does not set out any document which
may be the subject of the charge.

In our view, this
assumes that a document made the sub­ject of a charge should be referred to in
the count, but that it will not be necessary to "" set out "" the
document itself. In the present case, although apparently the Attorney-General
intended to charge against the accused the distribution of certain pamphlets,
no reference in the indictment is made to these pamphlets, or, indeed, to any
pamphlet at all. A fortiori, was there no ""setting out,"" in
whole or in part, of the pamphlets in question; although the omission to ""
set out "" the document is alone stated as being the omission which shall
not be deemed objection-able or shall not render the count insufficient.

The same reasoning may
be made in respect to sub-section (e) of sec. 855, that the count

does not set out the words used where words
are the subject of the charge.

Under subsections (f)
and (g), a count is not insufficient for the reason

that it does not specify the means by which
the offence was com­mitted,

or

that it does not name or describe with
precision any person, place or thing.

It seems to us that the
very terms in which the exceptions are expressed underline the minimum of
ingredients which a valid count of an indictment should contain. It must
contain, in substance, a statement of the specific act which is charged,
although it is not necessary that it should ""specify the means"" by
which the act was committed, or that it, should name, or describe, ""with
precision"" any

[Page 197]

person, place or thing.
In the latter provision, the essen­tial words are the words: ""with
precision.""

That this is the
correct interpretation of sec. 855 is strengthened, in our view, by comparison
with sec. 859 enumerating the cases in which particulars may be ordered.

Subsection (d) of sec.
859 deals with the charge of sell­ing, or exhibiting, an obscene book,
pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing. If the court is satisfied that it is
necessary for a fair trial, it may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars stating
what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper or other printing or writing are
relied on in support of the charge. Which presupposes that the book, pamphlet,
newspaper, printing or writing has already been referred to in the charge.

This is made still
clearer in subsections (e), (f)
and (g) relating to ""
any document or words the subject of a charge""; to ""means by which
any offence was com­mitted""; or to "" any person, place or thing
referred to in any indictment."" Each of these subsections begins by the
words: "" further describing,"" which obviously contemplates
indictments already describing the document or words the subject of a charge,
the means by which any offence was committed, but requiring a ""further
"" description which, in the view of the Court, "" is necessary for a
fair trial.""

As for the
""person, place or thing"" dealt with in sub-section (g), the point is
made doubly clear, since the sub-section speaks of a ""person, place or
thing (already) re­ferred to in any indictment""; and it is stated that a
particular may be ordered ""further describing"" them.

The evident relation
between the matters dealt with in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g) of sec. 855 and the corre­sponding subsections
of sec. 859 is, we think, illuminating on the subject-matter of the present
discussion. Clearly the result flowing from the two sections read together is:
that some statement of the particular circumstances of the offence charged is
assumed to be already contained in the count; that there may be omissions
which, on account of sec. 855, are not sufficient to make the count
objectionable; that the count will not be deemed insufficient by reason only of
those omissions; and that if the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a
fair trial, it may order particulars to describe further, or with more
precision the matters in question.

[Page 198]

It need not be added
that we are speaking now of counts in general, without reference to special
cases such as are: libel, perjury, false pretence, or other cases which are the
objects of special provisions with regard to indictment in the Criminal Code .

Applying the above
principles to the present appeal, it follows that the indictment must be found
insufficient. It is not the case where an offence is imperfectly stated; it is
a case where essential averments were wholly omitted. The so-called indictment
contains defects in matters of substance. To use the apt words of counsel for
the appel­lants: “it does not describe the offence in such a way as to lift it
from the general to the particular.""

Of course, we are
dealing with a case of conspiracy; and we are not unaware of the fact that in
stating the object of the conspiracy the same certainty may not be required as
in an indictment for the offence conspired to be com­mitted (Archbold's
Criminal Pleading, 29th ed., at p. 1419).

On a charge of
conspiracy, the agreement is itself the gist of the offence (Paradis v. The
King[12]).
The mere agreement to commit the crime is regarded by the law sufficient to
render the parties to it guilty at once of a crime (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal
Law, 13th ed., p. 81).

And we need only recall
the often cited passage of Lord Chelmsford in Mulcahy v. The Queen[13]:

It cannot exist without the consent of two
or more persons; and their agreement is an act in advancement of the intention
which each of them has conceived in his mind.

In other words, to
borrow the expression of Mr. Justice Willes (Mulcahy v. The Queen at p.
317): ""The very plot is an act in itself."" It follows that a person
may be convicted of conspiracy as soon as it has been formed and before any
overt act has been committed. The offence is complete as soon as the parties
have agreed as to their unlawful purpose (Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th
ed., p. 289; Belyea v. The King[14]).
Hence the overt acts need not be set out in the indictment (Archbold's Crim­inal
Pleading, 29th ed., p. 1420. The King v. Hutchin­son[15]).

[Page 199]

The conspiracy is the
offence. It is not necessary to show that the accused went on to commit some
overt act towards carrying out the conspiracy. The actual accom­plishment of
the crime agreed upon will not cause the original offence of conspiracy to
become merged in it (Kenny, pp. 289 and 290).

But although conspiracy
to commit a crime, being in itself an indictable offence, may be charged alone
in an indictment and independently of the crime conspired to be committed, it
does not follow that the count charging con­spiracy alone, without the setting
out of any overt act, must not describe it in such a way as to contain in
sub-stance the fundamental ingredients of the particular agreement which is
charged, or, in other words, in such a way as to specify, in substance, the
specific transaction intended to be brought against the accused.

These averments were
omitted and these necessary in­gredients were lacking in the indictment
preferred against the appellants. Their absence constitutes defects in matters
of substance; and we are of opinion that these defects were not cured by the
so-called incomplete particulars verbally given by the Crown when, at the
outset of the trial, objection was taken to the indictment by counsel for the
accused. The Crown, it may be added, in the argu­ment before us did not rely on
these particulars, and took the stand that the indictment was sufficient as it
stood. Nor can we accede to the argument that, in the circum­stances, no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred and that we
should exercise the powers given to us by sec. 1014  of the Criminal Code . In
our view, it was a substantial wrong towards the appellants to have compelled
them to plead to an illegal indictment.

The motion to quash the
indictment made by the accused at the beginning of the trial, and before
pleading, ought to have been granted. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed.
The indictment and the conviction must be quashed, the Crown being at liberty
to prefer a fresh indictment, if so advised.

We do not want to part
with this appeal, however, with-out saying that our decision is strictly
limited to the points in issue. We would not like to be taken as subscribing to
certain generalities contained in some of the judgments to

[Page 200]

which we have been
referred and which would tend to convey the idea that, notwithstanding the
coming into force of the Criminal Code , the criminal law in this country should
continue to be administered as though there were no Code.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.

APPEAL by the accused from a judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1],
Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting, affirming the judgment of the trial judge,
Doull J., with a jury, by which the appellant was found guilty of murder.

The appellant was, after trial before a jury,
convicted before Mr. Justice Doull of the murder of a young boy at Chain Lakes, Halifax county, on the 17th October, 1934,

[Page 635]

and on the 20th of the same month sentenced
to death on the 10th January, 1935.

On the appeal to this Court, after hearing
argument of counsel, the Court delivered judgment dismissing the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO.

accused—Whether voluntary—Evidence by police officers in rebuttal—Lack of
warning—Whether evidence admissible—Prejudicial to accused—Substantial
wrong—Miscarriage of justice—New trial—Charge to jury—Misdirection—Section 1014
Cr. C.

The appellant was convicted of murder.
Evidence was given at the trial that in the middle of the night, one day after
the murder, the accused was removed from his cell and, escorted by three police
officers, was taken out a road in search of the revolver that shot the victim.
The accused was cross-examined on the incidents of that trip and one police
officer testified in rebuttal as to the course of conduct and the conversation
of the accused on that occasion.

Held that
there should be a new trial. Under the circumstances of the case, such evidence
was inadmissible in the absence of proof that the statements made by the
accused were voluntary and upon proper warning; and the curative effect of
section 1014 (2) of the Criminal

[Page 658]

Code cannot be applied, as it cannot properly
be said that there has been “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.”
Judgment of the Supreme Court in banco (8 M.P.R. 407) rev.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia in banco[1],
affirming the conviction of the appellant upon trial for murder.

The appellant was convicted at Sydney of the
murder of one Cleo Markadonis, his
brother’s wife. She was killed by a 32-calibre revolver bullet. The murder was
committed about 4 o’clock p.m. on July 20, 1934.

D. A. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.

J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. and M. A. Patterson
for the respondent

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont J. and
Dysart J. ad hoc was delivered by

Duff C.J.—In his dissenting judgment Mr. Justice Mellish says:

Dealing with ground no. 7 the objection is
taken to the part of the charge dealing with the evidence of Hickey in the
language set out in said notice when the learned judge comments on the alleged’
failure of Hickey to see the prisoner come from the back of the house to the
garage.

I think the language used suggests that
Hickey who was a Crown witness is keeping back further evidence damaging to the
accused. I do not think the suggestion is justified. In the interest of the
accused it is a dangerous suggestion because at best it has no probative value
and it is doubly dangerous because it may not be justified by the facts.

The eighth grounds of complaint is I think
justified, and there is considerable evidence I think corroborating the
prisoner’s evidence that he did walk down Marconi
 street.

The ninth ground of complaint is to the
effect that the learned trial judge expressed his own views as to the
prisoner’s credibility unfairly in using the words therein set out.

In dealing with the probable effect of
these words we should I think look at the precise circumstances under which
they were used. The prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf and on his
cross-examination he was repeatedly asked in effect what his opinion was as to
the veracity of several Crown witnesses. The questions were I think irrelevant
and should not have been asked, and it appears surprising that they were not
objected to. The answers to such questions might prejudice the accused before the
jury, and I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for asking them. It is a
method of cross examination which I think is unfair and should not be resorted
to nor allowed especially in a case like the present: Regina v.

[Page 659]

Bernard[2]; McMillan v.
Walker[3]; North
Australian Territory Co. v. Goldsborough Mort & Co.[4]. Subsequent events I think leave no doubt
as to the purpose for which this method was adopted.

The learned judge in dealing with the
evidence of the witness Beard remarks: “The prisoner says he is not telling the
truth, and he is asking twelve reasonable and intelligent men to believe that
Beard came to this court and committed perjury.” The learned judge then almost
at once expresses his view as to the credibility of the prisoner in the language
complained of. I think in view of what had previously been said the jury might
have reasonably inferred that they might come to the same conclusion more
especially as the prisoner had accused “a responsible and intelligent looking
man” of committing perjury, and that they would have to find this charge proven
if they believed the prisoner. The tenth ground of objection is to the
admission of evidence. The police, when the prisoner was under arrest obtained
damaging statements from him which were not shewn to be voluntary and which
nevertheless were put in evidence against him. The only justification suggested
for putting in such evidence was that it was given in rebuttal. This is in my
opinion no real justification for putting in statements which are prima
facie not voluntary. I am unable to say that the jury would have reached
the same conclusion if this evidence had not been admitted. It was obviously, I
think, put in to influence the jury and was calculated to influence them to the
prisoner’s detriment.

I entirely agree in this.

Mr. Justice Carroll in his dissenting judgment
says:

There is one ground raised, however, which
merits very grave consideration. This concerns the rebuttal evidence given by
officer Churchill. I do not think any of the evidence given by Churchill as
rebuttal was in fact rebuttal, but the right of the Crown to give evidence
other than rebuttal with the permission of the trial judge, after the defence
has closed its case, cannot be challenged.

The objection to this evidence is as to its
admissibility; that certain statements made by the accused to the officers,
while out on the Morien road the night after the tragedy, were in their nature
incriminating and therefore could not be admitted as evidence, because the
trial judge was not invited to and did not rule that the statements were made
voluntarily.

It was argued by counsel for the Crown that
these statements were admissions not in the nature of confessions, and not in
their nature incriminating and therefore not subject to the rule that decision
must be made on their voluntary character before they became admissible. It is
rather surprising that if that was the opinion of the learned counsel that he
did not tender the evidence as part of the Crown’s main case when officer Churchill
was first called.

The accused under cross-examination was
asked, in reference to his midnight trip over the Morien road with the police
officers, “Did you tell the officers that you threw the revolver away on the
Morien road?” He did not answer that question directly, but went on to narrate
certain circumstances under which he was required to go out on this midnight
expedition and of the existence of conditions going over and while there. If
those conditions existed and the circumstances narrated are true (and I think
officer Churchill practically admits their truth) then no judge

[Page 660]

would admit as voluntary any statement made
under those circumstances. Churchill testified: “We asked him why he did not go
and find the gun, and he said, we did not let him go far enough, and he said
let us go back a little farther and when he came back he said we would
have better luck in the day time.” The learned trial judge told the jury
that accused must have known that they were over there looking for the gun that
shot Cleo Markadonis.

Now this statement of accused does not
amount to what is known as a “plenary” confession but is a statement which
gives rise to an inference that he hid the revolver which shot Cleo Markadonis for whose murder he was being tried and
a further inference is that he shot her with that revolver. It is a
self-harming statement which thrown into the mass of circumstantial evidence
would lend much weight and strength to the chain.

I think under the circumstances that the
evidence was not admissible. If however by any chance it was rightly admitted,
in such case I think there should have been an instruction to the jury as to
the weight of that evidence and what his state of mind would be under the
circumstances, and whether he made the statement in order to escape a situation
which to say the least could not be pleasant to him. If admissible for the
reason that an acknowledgment of guilt cannot reasonably be inferred from the
language attributed to the accused, then I think the trial judge should caution
the jury as to its true effect. Rex v. Christie[5].

However, I do not think that my brother
judges with whom I differ seriously suggest that the evidence of the statement
is under the circumstances admissible. Their judgment is based I think on the
curative effect of the Criminal Code , section 1014 (2) , that notwithstanding
the reception of the inadmissible evidence “no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has actually occurred” and therefore there should not be a new
trial.

This section or its equivalent has been the
subject of inquiry and controversy in our own and in English courts. I shall
refer to three precedents: Allen v. The King[6]; Makin v. The Attorney-General of
New South Wales[7]; and Maxwell v.
The Director of Public Prosecutions[8].
In the Makin case7 the Lords of the Privy Council decided
that a section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of New South Wales
(“Provided that no conviction or judgment thereon shall be reversed, arrested
or avoided on any case so stated unless for some substantial wrong or other
miscarriage of justice”) does not on its true construction empower the court to
affirm a conviction where the evidence submitted to the jury was inadmissible
and may have influenced the verdict. In that case the Lord Chancellor said
(pp. 69, 70): “Reliance was of course placed upon the language of the proviso.
It was said that if without the inadmissible evidence there was evidence
sufficient to sustain the verdict and to show the accused was guilty, there has
been no substantial wrong or other miscarriage of justice. It is obvious that
the construction contended for transfers from the jury to the court the
determination of the question whether the evidence—that is to say what the law
regards as evidence—established the guilt of the accused. In their Lordships’
opinion substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of
the verdict of a jury on the facts proved by legal evidence

[Page 661]

and there were substituted for it the
verdict of the court founded merely upon the perusal of the evidence.” Then his
Lordship pointed out that there is ample scope for the operation of the
proviso, where the evidence improperly admitted can have no possible influence
on the jury “as for example where some merely formal matter not bearing direct
on the guilt or innocence of the accused has been proved by other than legal
evidence.” In the Allen case[9] the
Supreme Court of Canada followed the Makin case (2) and held that the
inadmissible evidence may have influenced the verdict of the jury. The
Chief Justice in that case said (p. 339): “I cannot agree that the effect of
the section is to do more than give the judges on an appeal a discretion which
they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other
irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the
jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt about this the prisoner
must get the benefit of the doubt propter favorem vitœ.”

It should be observed that the proviso in the
Canadian Criminal Code is not expressed in the same language as the English
statute. It is very important to note that in our Code the proviso requires
that a conviction or judgment shall not be quashed except for “some substantial
wrong” or some miscarriage of justice.

In Makin’s case[10], it was said by the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council, speaking through Lord Herschell, that it cannot

properly be said that there has been no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice where, on a point material to the
guilt or innocence of the accused, the jury have, notwithstanding objection,
been invited by the judge to consider in arriving at their verdict matters
which ought not to have been submitted to them.

The learned trial judge did not, before
admitting evidence of what occurred between the accused and the police
officers, decide, as it was his duty to do, that what the accused said was
voluntary.

Now, it is quite true that evidence wrongfully
admitted may be of a character so trivial that it could not affect the result.
We agree with the dissenting judges in the view that this cannot be affirmed
with regard to the evidence adduced in rebuttal which was objected to. The
learned trial judge emphasized with a good deal of vigour the evidence adduced
concerning that episode.

We do not think, moreover, in considering the
probable effect of the evidence, that the accused was imputing perjury to the
witnesses against him as suggested by counsel for the Crown in his questions
addressed to the accused,

[Page 662]

which suggestion was impressively commented upon
by the learned trial judge in his charge. Nor should we overlook the
circumstance that while the case for the Crown was powerfully presented to the
jury in the judge’s charge, the considerations weighing in favour of the
prisoner were by no means brought out with their full effect.

We think, for the reasons given by the
dissenting judges, that there was a mistrial and that the case should be
brought before another jury.

There will be a new trial.

Cannon J.—The appellant, convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged
for unlawfully killing, on the 20th July, 1934, Cleo Markadonis,
his sister-in-law, appeals from the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia in banco on questions of law raised by Mellish J., and
Carroll J., dissenting.

The majority of the court found that, even if
the alleged irregularities in the judge’s charge or the illegal admission of
evidence in rebuttal existed, “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
had actually occurred,” and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed. The
formal order ignores the amendment brought by 21-22 Geo. V, ch. 28, section 14, to article 1013  of the
Criminal Code  and does not “specify any ground or grounds in law on which such
dissent is based either in whole or in part.” We are therefore compelled to
abstract from the opinions of the learned judges the questions which fall
within our jurisdiction.

The dissenting judgment of Honourable Mr.
Justice Mellish apparently deals with the grounds of appeal numbered 7, 7a,
8, 9 and 10, which are as follows:

(7) Because the learned judge, in his
general summing up of Hickey’s evidence, unduly emphasized the time when Hickey
first saw the prisoner to the disadvantage of the prisoner, particularly in the
following paragraph:

“The important fact to remember in this
man’s evidence is that however friendly disposed he was towards the prisoner he
did not pretend to say that he saw the prisoner in the garage at the time he
heard the shot and that the first time he saw him was after he heard Mrs. Markadonis hollering, and stood up. I again
state I think that that is rather an extraordinary story for Hickey to tell,
that he did not see the prisoner come from the back of the house into the
garage.”

(7a) Because the whole of the
learned judge’s charge partook unreasonably of the nature of advocacy against
the prisoner, rather than that of impartial presentation of the facts, from the
viewpoint of the Crown and the prisoner.

[Page 663]

(8) Because in making the following comment
on the prisoner’s evidence:

“Why did not Trysok and Murrant see him on Marconi street at the time? Why did not
Mrs. Murrant see him? It is puzzling to me. If this bright young fellow, Peter
Trysok, is telling the truth, then the prisoner never walked down Marconi street that day from the Markadonis
house

the learned judge stated as a fact, that
the prisoner never walked down Marconi street that day; whereas he might very well have walked down Marconi street, and Peter Trysok be still
telling the truth.

(9) Because the learned judge, in making
the following comment:

“I personally have no hesitation in stating
that, in my opinion at least, his story is a tissue of lies almost from
beginning to end, but you will accept that statement subject to the observaion
which I have already made that the facts are for you entirely.”

unduly and unfairly prejudiced the
prisoner’s defence, notwithstanding the qualifying words he used.

(10) Because the evidence of N. W.
Churchill, corporal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was improperly admitted.

His Lordship Mr. Justice Carroll retained only
no. 10 and agreed with the other members of the court that the other points
were not sufficient to quash the conviction.

On grounds of appeal 7-7a-8-9, Mr.
Justice Carroll says:

The trial judge expressed strong opinions
on certain matters of fact and evidence which opinions were not favourable to
the accused. A trial judge in summing up has that right so long as he makes it
clear to the jury that they are the judges of the facts and are not bound to
accept his views. This the learned trial judge did and I do not think it can he
said that, either in fact or in effect, he withdrew from the consideration of
the jury anything material.

I agree with Mr. Justice Carroll and the
majority of the appellate court in refusing to grant a new trial on account of
the judge’s charge to the jury. These alleged misdirections on questions of
fact, in view of the repeated warning given to the jury that they were the sole
judges of the facts and of the credibility of the witnesses, including the prisoner,
could not harm the latter, unless they were accompanied by a misdirection, or
constituted a misdirection, on a point of law, which I have been unable to find
after a careful perusal of the summing up.

The cardinal point to be determined is the one raised
by both the dissenting judges below as to the admissibility in rebuttal of the
evidence of sergeant Churchill; and on this I agree with my Lord the Chief
Justice that the prisoner’s declaration on his night trip to Morien road while
under arrest should not have been given to the jury under the

[Page 664]

circumstances; and for the reasons recently
given by me re Chapdelaine v. The King[11], I would order a new trial.

Davis J.—In considering
whether or not the accused had a fair trial on the charge of murder upon which
he was convicted and is under sentence of death, we should observe firstly that
there was neither in the evidence at the trial nor in the argument before us
the slightest suggestion of any motive that might have prompted the accused in
killing his sister-in-law if he was the one who in fact committed the crime;
secondly, that the revolver used to commit the crime was not produced and
apparently was never found; thirdly, that the accused was only eighteen years
of age at the time of the murder.

The theory of the Crown is that the accused
fired a shot from an old revolver he had secured and then went out on the Marien road and buried the revolver. Evidence
was given at the trial that in the middle of the night (a day after the murder)
the accused was removed from his cell and, escorted by three police officers,
was taken out the Marien road in
search of his revolver. The accused was cross-examined at length on the
incidents of that trip and his answers were made the basis for rebuttal
evidence. The whole course of conduct and conversation of the accused on that
trip was clearly inadmissible in the absence of any proof that the statements
made were voluntary and upon proper warning. But quite apart from that, it was
inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The evidence of the accused himself and
of the Crown witness in rebuttal of all that was said and done on that trip
proved nothing relevant to the issue, and was inadmissible from its own lack of
evidential value. While it was admitted that the accused protested throughout
the trip that he did not have a gun the day of the murder and none was found,
the story of that midnight trip to the Marien road was pregnant with suspicion that might readily affect the minds
of the jury to the prejudice of the accused. The trial of this lad of so
heinous an offence should have been devoid of the story of that trip and no
matter upon whom the fault

[Page 665]

lies for its introduction, the very justice of
the case requires that there be a new trial.

Moreover, I
cannot escape from the view that the charge of the learned trial judge
did not present certain aspects of the case in favour of the accused that
should have been dealt with and considered. Firstly, the absence of any proof
of motive. While it is not the motive but the intent which is essential, proof
of motive becomes of importance where the evidence as here against the accused
is entirely circumstantial. Secondly, the possibility if not the probability
that fear on the part of the lad may have accounted for his staying away from
the house after the murder and for some of his actions subsequently to the
murder, might well have been considered by the jury. Nothing whatever was said
to the jury that would lead them to face the problem of the possible innocence of
the accused.

In every view of the case the trial was
unsatisfactory and I would grant a new trial.

Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Assault—Conviction—Appeal—Motion
before appellate court for leave to adduce new evidence—Dissenting opinion in
the judgment dismissing motion—Conviction unanimously affirmed by appellate
court—Whether appeal to Supreme Court of Canada—Section 1023 Cr. C.

The appellants were tried and
convicted on a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On the hearing
of their grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal, the appellants moved
also for leave to admit new evidence. This motion was dismissed by a majority
of the Court of Appeal, two judges expressing dissenting opinions. Later on,
the Court of Appeal rendered judgment affirming unanimously the conviction of
the appellants; and such judgment contained also a paragraph mentioning the
fact that dissenting opinions had been expressed by two members of the Court on
the motion to adduce new evidence.

Held that the dissent in the Court of Appeal on the
motion for leave to introduce new evidence is not a dissent of that Court
against the affirmance of the appellants' conviction on a question of law
within the meaning of section 1023  of the Criminal Code .

The material facts of the case
and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment
now reported.

J. Nicholson for the
appellants.

Gordon McG. Sloan K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

Lamont J.—This is an appeal from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dated the 8th day of
January, A.D. 1935, affirming the conviction of the appellants by His Honour
Judge Lampman in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court, in and for the county
of Victoria, on the charge that they did, on the 3d day of March, 1934,
unlawfully assault Fong Chan Ten and did thereby occasion him actual bodily
harm.

The appellants were tried and the
conviction was recorded on June 29, 1934. They each filed a notice of appeal to
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on several grounds.

On the hearing of the appeal the
appellants moved the Court of Appeal for leave to admit the evidence of two
witnesses, who were not called at the trial, and to set aside the conviction
and order a new trial on the ground that even though the evidence adduced at
the trial might have justified a finding of guilty, the evidence of these two
new witnesses raised a doubt as to the appellants' guilt.

The motion to admit the new
evidence was refused, on the 29th of October, 1934, by the Court of Appeal,
McPhillips and M. A. MacDonald, JJ.A., dissenting. But the conviction was not
affirmed until the 8th of January, 1935. The formal judgment of the court affirming the
conviction, after properly reciting what had taken place, contains the
following:—

And this Court having
ordered, on the 29th October, 1934, that the motion to set aside the conviction
and order a new trial on the ground of the discovery of the new evidence, be
dismissed, *** and this Court having directed that this appeal do stand for
judgment and upon the same coming on this day for judgment the Court doth order
and adjudge that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed and the
conviction affirmed.

[Page 637]

There was no dissenting judgment
to the affirmance of the conviction, but the formal judgment contains this
paragraph:—

The Honourable Mr. Justice
McPhillips and the Honourable M. A. MacDonald dissented from the judgment of
this Court on the motion to set aside the conviction and order a new trial on
the ground of the discovery of the new evidence.

It is upon these disenting
judgments on the motion to admit new evidence that the appellants claim a right
to appeal to this Court under section 1023  of the Criminal Code , which provides
that any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been
affirmed by an appeal taken under section 1013 , may appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on
which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

We are all of opinion that the
dissent in the Court of Appeal on the motion for leave to introduce new
evidence is not a dissent against the affirmance of the appellants' conviction
on a question of law within the meaning of section 1023 .

This Court has therefore no
jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Rex v. Boak (1). 

The motion to quash will
therefore be granted.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Indictment for
murder—Conviction of manslaughter—Offence of counselling abortion—Dying
declaration—Admissibility—Sections 69 and 303 Cr. C.

The accused was convicted of manslaughter on a charge of
murder for having caused the death of V. K. by counselling or procuring G. S.
unlawfully to use instruments upon her with intent to procure her miscarriage,
contrary to the combined effect of sections 69  and 303  of the Criminal Code .
The dying declaration was a lengthy narrative by the deceased which day by day
she related to her mother, who wrote down the story; this narrative, which
concluded with the words ""I wish Carl punished,"" appeared to have
been read over to the deceased shortly before her death and adopted by her at
that time as a true statement; a number of questions at the same time were
submitted to her by police officers, and her answers with the questions were
the subject matter of two separate declarations. The narrative, together with
the two short statements containing the questions and answers, were all put
before the jury. It was common ground that the case against the accused could
not be established without evidence of the dying declaration.

Held, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal
([1935] 2 W.W.R. 146) that the dying declaration was inadmissible. Therefore
the conviction was quashed and a judgment and verdict of acquittal was directed
to be entered.

Per Lamont and Davis JJ.—Assuming that the indictment
could properly be said to be one for homicide (it is apparently one for the
statutory offence of abortion), a great part of the narrative and the
statements was outside the competence of a dying declaration in that many of
the facts alleged and the wish expressed by the deceased were irrelevant as no
part of the res gestae, extending far beyond the immediate circumstances
of the death of the declarant, and were most harmful to a fair trial of the
accused. Dying declarations are competent only in homicidal cases, and then
only in so far as the statements therein could have been given in evidence by
the deceased had she lived. To permit an entire statement to go to a jury, with
instructions from the trial judge to disregard such portions as he might point
out to be irrelevant and inadmissible, may in the case of a simple and short
statement be proper, but in a statement in the form of a lengthy narrative it
would be highly improper to permit the whole statement to go to the jury
notwithstanding instructions from the judge as to the portions which he thought
incompetent. In spite of instructions, the jury might easily be influenced
against the accused.

[Page 368]

Per Cannon and Crocket JJ.—In order to obtain the
conviction of the accused on the indictment as laid, the Crown had to rely on
section 69  (d) of the Criminal Code  and prove first that he had
counselled or procured the abortion. In order to prove this essential element
and link the accused to the abortion and killing, the statements contained in
the dying declaration could not be used. The accused's alleged relations with
the woman G. S. is a subject-matter different from that of the immediate
circumstances of the death of V. K. The statement of the deceased may perhaps
be used to prove the cause of the death and the intervention of the
abortionist's instrument, but could not be used as evidence that the accused
had anything to do with the abortionist. Even if the dying declaration may have
been admissible as a whole against the woman G. S. (which is at least doubtful)
it certainly could not be used to prove circumstances, not directly and
immediately connected with the fatal application of instruments which finally
brought death.

Per Dysart J. (ad hoc)—The charge as laid was at
most a charge of bringing about the death of V. K. by counselling or procuring
G. S. to perform on V. K. an abortion resulting in the death. Under this
specific charge, most of the statements contained in the dying declaration,
alleging that the accused counselled or procured V. K. herself to bring about
or undergo an abortion operation, were irrelevant and therefore inadmissible.
The only statement that may have a bearing at all upon the charge as laid could
not possibly support a conviction on that charge, and, therefore, ought to have
been excluded. Thus all parts of the declaration are shown to have been
inadmissible. If, however, any portion of it could be thought to be admissible,
the admissible parts should have been placed before the jury, separate and
apart from the document.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the conviction of the appellant for
manslaughter, in a trial before D. A. McDonald J. and a jury.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

R. L. Maitland K.C. for
the appellant.

Gordon McG. Sloan K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of Lamont and Davis
JJ. was delivered by

DAVIS J.—The real question in this appeal is as to the
admissibility of a dying declaration. It is common ground that the case against
the accused cannot be established without the evidence of the dying
declaration.

[Page 369]

In the words of Byles, J., in Rex
v. Jenkins[2] ,

These dying declarations are
to be received with scrupulous, I had almost said with superstituous, care. The
declarant is subject to no cross-examination. No oath need be administered.
There can be no prosecution for perjury. There is always danger of mistake
which cannot be corrected.

Here the indictment in my opinion
is not one for homicide but for the statutory offence of abortion (sections 69 
and 303  of the Criminal Code ). The sections of our statute which define and
prescribe a punishment for abortion do not make the death of the woman one of
the constituent elements of the offence. Where, however, as in some of the
United States, the statutes provide for the punishment of abortions resulting
in death, 1 Corpus Juris, p. 326, the woman's dying declarations have been
admitted upon the ground that the death is an essential ingredient of the
offence and the subject of the charge.

As early as 1824, in The King v.
Mead[3]
Abbott C.J. stated the general rule that evidence of dying declarations is only
admissible where the death of the deceased is the subject of the charge and the
circumstances of the death the subject of the dying declaration. In a footnote
to the report of that case, Rex v. Hutchinson, tried before Bayley, J., at
the Durham Spring Assizes, 1822, is referred to. There the prisoner was
indicted for administering savin to a woman pregnant, but not quick with child,
with intent to procure abortion. The woman was dead, and for the prosecution,
evidence of her dying declaration upon the subject was tendered. The learned
judge rejected the evidence, observing that, although the declaration might
relate to the cause of the death, still such declarations were admissible in
those cases alone where the death of the party was the subject of enquiry. Then
in Regina v.
Hind[4]
, the accused was tried and convicted upon an indictment charging him with
feloniously and unlawfully using certain instruments upon the person of one
Mary Woolford, deceased, with intent to procure the miscarriage of the said
Mary Woolford. On the trial, a dying declaration of the said Mary Woolford was tendered
in evidence on the part of the prosecution and objected to on the part of the
prisoner, upon the ground that the death of Mary

[Page 370]

Woolford was not the subject of
the enquiry. Pollock, C.B., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal
Appeal, said:

In this case we are all of
opinion that the dying declaration of the woman was improperly received in
evidence. The rule we are disposed to adhere to, is to be found laid down in Rex
v. Mead[5]
. There Abbott C.J. said, ""The general rule is, that evidence of this
description is only admissible where the death of the deceased is the subject
of the charge, and the circumstances of the death the subject of the dying
declaration."" Speaking for myself, I must say that the reception of this kind
of evidence is clearly an anomalous exception in the law of England,
which I think ought not to be extended.

The conviction was quashed.

If the indictment here can
properly be said to be one for homicide (though I do not think it can) the
dying declaration is in fact a lengthy narrative by the deceased which day by
day she related to her mother, who wrote down the story. This narrative, which
concludes with the words ""I wish Carl punished,"" appears to have been
read over to the deceased shortly before her death and adopted by her at that
time as a true statement. A number of questions at the same time were submitted
to her by police officers, and her answers with the questions were the subject
matter of two separate declarations. The narrative, together with the two short
statements containing the questions and answers, were all put before the jury.
Upon any view of the matter, much of the narrative and the statements was
plainly outside the competence of a dying declaration in that many of the facts
alleged and the wish expressed by the deceased were irrelevant as no part of
the res gestae, extending far beyond the immediate circumstances of the
death of the declarant, and were most harmful to a fair trial of the accused.
Clearly, dying declarations are competent only in homicidal cases, and then
only in so far as the statements therein could have been given in evidence by
the deceased had she lived. To permit an entire statement to go to a jury, with
instructions from the trial judge to disregard such portions as he might point
out to be irrelevant and inadmissible, may in the case of a simple and short
statement be proper, but in a statement in the form of a lengthy narrative it
would be highly improper in my view to permit the whole statement to go to the
jury notwithstanding instructions from

[Page 371]

the judge as to the portions
which he thought incompetent. In spite of instructions, the jury might easily
be influenced against the accused. There is authority, on the other hand, for
the Court entirely excluding such portions of the declaration as the judge
might consider irrelevant and inadmissible, but in the case of a lengthy
statement in the nature of a narrative (most of which is irrelevant and
inadmissible) it would be difficult if not impossible to pick out certain
sentences here and there to submit to a jury without altering the meaning which
the same bore with the remainder in its orignal context, and such a course is
too dangerous to adopt.

There being plainly no evidence
upon which a conviction could properly be sustained without the admission of
the dying declaration, the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed,
and pursuant to section 1014 (3)  (a) and section 1024  of the Criminal
Code , a judgment and verdict of acquittal directed to be entered.

The judgment of Cannon and
Crocket JJ. was delivered by

CANNON J.—The appellant was found
guilty of manslaughter, with a strong recommendation to mercy, and sentenced to
five years' imprisonment on the following indictment:

That he did unlawfully between
the twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine
hundred and thirty-four, and the sixteenth day of September one thousand nine
hundred and thirtyfour, at or near Greenwood, or Grand Forks, in the said
county of Yale, counsel or procure a certain person, to wit, Grietje Sundquest,
to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use unlawfully on the person of
Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with intent to procure a miscarriage
of Veronica Kuva, which offence the said Grietje Sundquest did commit and did
thereby kill and slay the said Veronica Kuva against the form of the statute in
such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lord the King, his
Crown and Dignity.

The Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissed his appeal on the 23rd of January, 1935[6]
, and the formal judgment sets out that the Honourable Mr. Justice McPhillips
dissented on the grounds in law that:

(1) The dying declaration of
Veronica Kuva was wrongfully admitted in evidence; or wrongfully admitted as to
counselling; and

(2) that the learned trial
judge misdirected the jury respecting the said evidence of the said Veronica
Kuva.

[Page 372]

All agree that if the dying
declaration be inadmissible, there is no evidence upon which a jury could find
against the appellant.

The learned dissenting judge
first says that it is by no means clear that the dying girl made the
declaration when in extremity and at the point of death. We are not in a
position to decide this point, in view of the fact that the evidence of the
circumstances surrounding the making and taking of the alleged dying
declarations is not before us; moreover, the question whether the deceased had
such a belief of impending death as to make her declaration admissible as a
dying declaration was for the judge and not for the jury. We are unable from
the record to say that the circumstances were such that the judge's decision to
admit the statement of the deceased as a dying declaration was against the law.

The learned dissenting judge adds
the following:

If it could be said
successfully that the dying declaration is receivable in evidence all reference
to counselling should be excluded from the declaration—see Regina v. Horsford—referred
to in Regina v. Rowland[7]
—further admittedly it is the evidence of an accomplice and whilst it may well
be said that the learned trial judge did give at first the proper warning to
the jury—he with great respect went on and said this—which to my mind
constituted a fatal error—

""If keeping all these
things in mind, the dangers, and the law as I have tried to give it to you, you
say 'Well, I have thought this over 'carefully, the judge has told us we can do
it if we see fit to do it. He 'has warned us of the danger, and warned us we
ought not to do it, still 'we think in this case if there ever was a case we
ought to convict.' If you feel that way, gentlemen, then it is your duty to
convict, but be very, very careful.""

This amounted to a direction
to the jury that if they believed the evidence of the accomplice although
uncorroborated it was their duty to convict the appellant. This course
of action on the part of the trial judge was in effect to render nugatory the
safeguard of the law—that is, he in the end failed to give the proper warning
to the jury as to the danger of convicting on the evidence of the accomplice
without corroboration in a material particular implicating the appellant—that
being the case the conviction should be quashed—Rex v. Tate[8]
; Rex v. Baskerville[9]
; Rex. v. Charavanamuthu.[10]
.

Our jurisdiction in this matter
is limited to the questions of law raised by the learned dissenting judge as
above.

Instead of simply indicting the
appellant with murder, or manslaughter, the Crown compounded a charge of coun-

[Page 373]

selling and procuring, between
the 29th day of August and the 16th day of September, 1934, the abortionist to
use unlawfully instruments with intent to procure the miscarriage of Veronica
Kuva; and the indictment adds that the abortionist did commit the indictable
offence charged, viz., the unlawful use of instruments, and did thereby kill
and slay the person whose dying declaration was used against the appellant.

It is evident that the person who
drew the indictment had in mind, first, section 69 (d) of the code and,
secondly, used the terms of section 303  of the Criminal Code , which reads as
follows:

303. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life who, with intent to
procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she is or is not with child,
unlawfully administers to her or causes to be taken by her any drug or other
noxious thing, or unlawfully uses on her any instrument or other means
whatsoever with the like intent.

The date of the death of the girl
is not mentioned in the indictment. This would seem to be an important
ingredient, if the Crown Attorney had in mind a charge of homicide, in view of
section 254 of the code:

254. No one is criminally
responsible for the killing of another unless the death takes place within a
year and a day of the cause of death.

2. The period of a year and
a day shall be reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last unlawful act
contributing to the cause of death took place.

There is no doubt that the
charge, which is particularized, does not specify the requirements of section
259 of the code concerning murder. No malice aforethought is alleged. It did
not even state that the appellant did counsel or procure an act which he knew
or ought to have known to be likely to cause death. The indictment says that he
counselled the unlawful use of an instrument with intent to procure a
miscarriage; but does not say that he knew or ought to have known that this was
likely to cause death.

However that may be, and without
deciding whether or not the combination or compound of these elements might
constitute a charge of homicide, it is nevertheless true that, qua the
appellant,, the Crown had to rely on section 69  (d) and prove first that
he had counselled or procured the abortion; otherwise he was not amenable to
answer for the happenings subsequent to the 16th of September. In order to
prove this essential element and link 

[Page 374]

him to the abortion and killing,
can the dying declaration be used? His alleged relations with the woman
Sundquest is a subject-matter different from that of the immediate
circumstances of the death of Veronica Kuva. The statement of the deceased may
perhaps be used to prove the cause of the death, the intervention of the
abortionist's instrument, but could not be used as evidence that from August to
the 16th of September the accused had anything to do with the abortionist. The
alleged declarations were heard and taken on the 3rd and 4th of October, 1934,
and covered events subsequent to the 16th of September, viz., the illness of
the patient and the other facts connected with the fatal result of the abortion—i.e.,
with the killing. It would be dangerous to allow such an extension of the
exception to the law of evidence which admits in cases of homicide only,
although hearsay evidence, the unsworn statement of the victim (whose death
must be the subject of the charge) although such statement is not made in the
presence of the accused and is not tested by cross-examination. Even if the
dying declaration may have been admissible as a whole against the woman
Sundquest (which is at least doubtful) it certainly could not be used to prove
circumstances, not directly and immediately connected with the illegal
application of instruments which finally brought death.

In Rex v. Gloster[11]
, Charles J., upon an indictment for murder, by performing an illegal
operation, statements made by a dying woman, in the absence of the prisoner,
were held admissible as to contemporaneous symptoms of her bodily condition but
nothing in the nature of a narrative was held admissible to show who caused
them or how they were caused.

The Court of Appeal in Rex v.
Thomson[12]
approved this ruling and Lord Alverstone C.J., Darling and Avory JJ. quoted
Charles J. as a great authority. I take this to be the law.

Moreover, it is doubtful whether
or not the only part of the declaration implicating the appellant as
""having, that night (2nd of September) talked to Mrs. Sundquest""
relates to a conversation in the presence of the girl, or is only hearsay as
far as she is concerned. If only

[Page 375]

hearsay, she would not have been
competent to testify about the alleged conversation if sworn in the cause;
therefore, her declaration as to this matter would not be admissible.

In view of the above, it is not
necessary to determine the second question raised by the dissenting judgment.

We will, therefore, allow the
appeal; and, as there is no other evidence available against the appellant,
direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

DYSART J. (ad hoc)—in
dissenting from the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[13] , Mr. Justice McPhillips says: ""In my opinion
the conviction herein must be quashed. Without the dying declaration there
is no evidence upon which the jury could found their verdict—and my view is
that the dying declaration is inadmissible in law."" The reasons for his
dissent may be summarized thus: (1) that the declarant was not at the point of
death when she made the declaration, or if she was, she did not realize it; (2)
that the portions of the declaration relating to counselling are inadmissible
in any event; (3) that the jury were not properly warned of the danger of
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the declarant, who was an
accomplice.

This dissent involves several
questions of law, any one of which, if the dissenting judge is correct, would
be fatal to the conviction. The most important of these is the question of
admissibility. While the right of a convicted person to appeal to this Court is
confined to ""any question of law on which there has been dissent in the
Court of Appeal"" which affirmed his conviction (section 1023 Cr. C.) this
Court is not restricted on such appeal to the grounds or reasons upon which the
dissent is based but may deal with the question of law entirely upon its merits.

Dying declarations are admissible
in evidence only in cases of homicide, where the death of the deceased is the
subject of the charge and where the circumstances of the death are the subject-matter
of the declaration: Reg. v. Hind[14]
. The first condition of admissibility of such declaration is that the charge
laid against the accused, on

[Page 376]

whose trial the declaration is
tendered, shall be one of homicide. Is that condition satisfied in this case?

The charge, which is set out
verbatim in the reasons of Mr. Justice Cannon, need not be repeated here. it
contains a direct allegation, and a statement of facts and consequences. The
direct allegation is that the accused did

counsel or procure ***
Grietje Sundquest to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use unlawfully on
the person of Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with intent to procure
a miscarriage of Veronica Kuva.

Then follows

which offence the said
Grietje Sundquest did commit and did thereby kill and slay the said Veronica
Kuva. ***

Is the direct allegation of
counselling or procuring sufficiently strengthened or buttressed by the
succeeding words to constitute a charge of homicide? Every charge must be clear
and unmistakable. Although section 852 of the Criminal Code  dispenses with the
need of technical language and unnecessary matter in charges, it does not
dispense with the necessity of specifying the offence in ""words sufficient
to give the accused notice of the offence with which he is charged."" The
offence so specified is the only one on which the accused can properly be
tried, and the prosecution must confine itself strictly within the terms of the
specifications. The specifying of the offence is equivalent to, or analogous
with, the giving of particulars, and restricts the field of the prosecution.
Where evidence is tendered which is outside of the confines of the specified
charge, it is inadmissible for irrelevancy, and even though not objected to by
counsel, should be excluded by the trial judge whose duty and responsibility it
is to see that nothing but properly admissible evidence is placed before the
jury. Although the charge, as here laid, seems to contain all the elements or
factors of a charge of homicide, that alone is not enough to satisfy the
requirements of such a charge.

Assuming, without deciding, that
the charge might be considered one of homicide, the most that can be said for
it is that it is homicide by the specified means of counselling or procuring
Mrs. Sundquest to commit the crime, thereby making the accused a principal
party under s. 69 . On this view any evidence tending to prove that the accused
committed homicide by means other than the counselling or procuring of Mrs.
Sundquest is irrelevant and inadmissible.

[Page 377]

The dying declaration, which is
in writing, contains much matter which could not on any view be regarded as
relevant to the circumstances of the death. These portions may or may not have
been prejudicial to the accused on his trial. If. they were, they should have
been excluded, and the exclusion of them would exclude the written declaration
as a whole. Then there are statements lying nearer the circumstances of the
death, but these have to do almost exclusively with transactions between the
accused and the declarant herself. The efforts of the accused in counselling or
procuring the declarant to undergo the illegal operation are therefore
inadmissible on the grounds above stated. These statements are to the effect
that the accused was responsible for the declarant's pregnancy; that after he
had tried unsuccessfully to bring about miscarriage by counselling or procuring
her to take certain pills, which she did take with intent to bring about
miscarriage, he counselled her to go to Grietje Sundquest ""to get rid of
the baby""; that he handed her $20 to give to Mrs. Sundquest and said that
if the sum were not enough he would give her more later; that he on one
occasion conveyed her to the vicinity of Mrs. Sundquest's premises, and on
other occasions supplied her with carfare for transportation to the same place.
These and other such statements were inadmissible because irrelevant, and in as
much as their effect upon the jury must have been prejudicial to the accused,
ought not to have been admitted. Their exclusion would exclude the document as a
whole.

The only statement contained in
the declaration that bears at all upon the charge as laid is that the accused
on the night of September 2 ""spoke to Mrs. Sundquest."" It is not
shown whether the declarant stated this from personal knowledge or from hearsay,
nor is the subject of the conversation between the accused and Mrs. Sundquest
mentioned. There is nothing to indicate that he at that time counselled or
urged Mrs. Sundquest to bring about miscarriage. The inference is that the
subject was not mentioned, as shown by another statement in the declaration,
that the declarant when she first visited Mrs. Sundquest said ""my boy
friend sent me""—a statement to which Mrs. Sundquest is not reported to
have replied, and which suggests that the accused had not previously

[Page 378]

spoken to Mrs. Sundquest on the
subject. Apart from these statements there is nothing in the dying declaration
to show the accused had ever directly or indirectly communicated with Mrs.
Sundquest. These statements could not possibly support a conviction on the
charge as laid and, therefore, ought to have been excluded.

Thus all parts of the declaration
are shown to have been inadmissible. If, however, any portion of it could be
thought to be admissible, the admissible parts should have been placed before
the jury, separate and apart from the document. This might have been done by
witnesses using the document to refresh recollection and putting in the
relevant or admissible portions in that form: Thiffault v. The King
(1).

It is unnecessary to deal with
the other questions raised on the dissent. The appeal should be allowed and a
verdict of acquittal should be entered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Smuggling—When offence
completed—Whether the master of a vessel had an opportunity of complying with
the provisions of the law—Customs Act, R.S.C., 1987, c.
42, s. 11, s. 203 (4) and s. 262.

Section 203, paragraph 4, of the Customs
Act , which applies only to vessels arriving within three miks of the coast of Canada and -section 11 of the same Act, which impliedly allows
the master of a vessel opportunity of complying with its conditions before
being deemed to have committed the offence of smuggling, have no application
under the following circumstances of this case: a vessel, on board of which
were both appellants, having cleared from Lévis, opposite Quebec, for Gaspé, stopped
somewhere below Rimouski to take over from a schooner a cargo of liquor and
then turned back to try and land these smuggled goods at some point on the
shores of the St. Lawrence, and then, to avoid capture by the ‘Government
patrol, the vessel was deliberately stranded and abandoned by its crew on the
shores of Beaumont, within the limits of the harbour of Quebec, several hundred
miles inland.

There is no conflict between the judgment
appealed from and the decision in Rex v. Langille
(57 Can. Cr. Cas. 151).

Judgment of the Court of King’s Bench (Q.R. 56 КБ.
88) aff.

[Page 520]

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1],
upon leave to appeal granted by Crocket J., Justice of the Supreme Court of
Canada, said judgments sustaining the conviction of both appellants, on their
trial before H. Fortier, J.S.P.
on a charge of smuggling.

Pierre Devarennes for the appellants.

Laetare Roy K.C. and Henri Bernier K.C.
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Cannon J.—The appellants were convicted before the Court of Sessions of the
Peace for the district of Quebec on an indictment which is translated as
follows by the parties:

To have, on or about the 18th of May in the
year 1932, in the waters of the St. Lawrence River, and particularly near
the shores of Beaumont, in the district of Quebec, assisted or otherwise
been concerned in the unshipping, the landing or removing and the importing of
goods illegally imported in Canada and upon which the exigible legitimate
duties had not been paid, by having under his control and his possession, on
board a yacht named Marinefs Joy,
an approximate quantity of 860 gallons of alcohol
fraudulently imported in Canada and upon which the exigible legitimate duties
had not been paid, said alcohol having an approximate value of $860, contrary
to R.S.C., c, 42, s. 193, ss. 3.

A penalty of $300 or four months imprisonment was imposed on both appellants. The Court
of King’s Bench of the province of Quebec dismissed their appeal. They obtained
special leave to appeal to this court, under section 1025  of the Criminal Code ,
because the decision of the Court of King’s Bench for the province of Quebec,
it was alleged, conflicted with the judgment in a like case of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia re Rex v. Langille[2].
The facts in the latter case are as follows:

On June 18, 1928, at eight o’clock in the
evening, the captain of one of the Canadian patrol boats came out of Ketch
Harbour, Halifax County, and sighted a motor boat a mile off Ketch Harbour Head
making towards land; the motor boat was stopped and found to contain a
considerable quantity of rum in kegs. Langille was in charge of the motor boat. The motor and cargo were seized and
brought to Halifax Harbour and Langille was charged of

[Page 521]

unlawfully smuggling into Canada goods subject
to duty. The judgment of the Nova Scotia court was to the effect that despite s.
203, par. 4, of the Customs Act  (s. 21 of c. 50 of the statutes of
Canada passed in 1927), which declares

that the offence of smuggling should be
deemed to be completely committed whenever any vessel containing goods not
reported pursuant to section 11 of the Act arrives within three miles of the
coast of Canada,

the offence is not complete until the master of
the vessel has had an opportunity of complying with the conditions laid down in
s. 11, i.e.,

of reporting to the Customs House after the
vessel is anchored or moored.

Mr. Justice Ross dissented from the above
judgment.

After careful consideration of the case, we find
that the Langille case[3] differed from the present ones. It must be
noted that subsection 4 applies when any vessel arrives within three
miles of the coast or shores of Canada, i.e., enters the territorial waters of
this country. This evidently covered the Nova Scotia case, as the vessel there
involved was approaching from the ocean the coast or shores of Canada, was
arriving and was still moving towards her destination. In the present case, the
vessel was deliberately stranded by its crew, to avoid capture by the
Government patrol, on the shores of Beaumont, within the limits of the harbour of Quebec, several hundred miles inland, on
the river St. Lawrence. Certainly it was not then arriving within three miles
of the coasts of Canada.

Moreover, by wilful stranding and the
abandonment of their boat on the shore, the appellants have placed themselves
in such a position that it was utterly impossible for them to arrive, anchor
or moor in the harbour of Quebec and comply with the requirements of section
11. That circumstance, of their own making, cannot help them. They could not be
first given the opportunity of declaring on arrival, as required by the Nova
Scotia decision, because, of their own accord, they had “arrived” and landed on
the Beaumont beach. It is admitted that both appellants were on board the boat
and that the dutiable goods which had admittedly been smuggled or clandestinely
introduced into Canada by another vessel were in

[Page 522]

their possession. Under section 262 of the Customs
Act , this possession once proven or admitted placed on the appellants the
burden of proof of all facts relating to the origin, the importation or the
payment of duty or the compliance with the requirements of the Act with regard
to the entry of any such goods.

Mr. Justice Dorion[4], with whom
concurred Howard, Rivard and Bond JJ., in his reasons for judgment, says:

Je crois que les présomptions créées par la loi contre les accusés ont précisément
pour but d’empêcher ce manège nonobstant Rex v. Langille[5], cité par l’appelant.

And Mr. Justice St. Jacques says, at page 94
(1):

Ces deux causes se distinguent nettement de
celle qui a été jugée par la cour suprême de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, Rex v Langille.5

Les faits révélés par la preuve sont bien
différents; et en rejetant l’appel, cette cour ne donne pas à la loi des
douanes une interprétation différente de celle que lui a donnée la cour suprême
de la Nouvelle-Ecosse.

The attitude of Mr. Justice Dorion and of the
majority of his colleagues disclosed an apparent conflict with Rex v. Langille5 sufficient to grant leave to appeal under 1025 Cr. С. After
considering the facts of the case, however, we agree with Mr. Justice St.
Jacques that there is no real conflict between the two courts of appeal, as
section 203, p. 4, of the Customs Act  applies only to vessels arriving
within three miles of the coast of Canada and could have no possible
application to a vessel which, having cleared from Levis for Gaspé, stopped
somewhere below Rimouski to take over from a schooner a cargo of liquor and
then turned back to try and land these smuggled goods at some point on the
shores of the St. Lawrence under the very inculpating circumstances disclosed
by the record.

We are, therefore, unanimously of opinion that
these appeals fail and should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Wounding with
intent to commit murder—Sufficiency of charge to jury—Criminal intent—Provocation—Self
defence—Defence of alibi—Inconsistency with other defences—Legal consequences
from story of complainant being different from that of witnesses.

On the trial for wounding with
intent to commit murder, the complainant stated that at about a quarter to 6
o'clock on the evening of November 6, 1932, after turning south on Jackson avenue
from Hastings street, in Vancouver, he turned and saw accused following him. He then
walked faster but as accused was catching up to him he ran diagonally across
the road in a southeasterly direction. When he reached the curb on the east
side of the road the accused caught up to him and fired a shot at him with a
revolver. Accused then took $90 from his pocket and after firing two more shots
at him ran across a vacant lot in a northeasterly direction, and on emerging on
Hastings street he was recognized by two witnesses with a revolver
in his hand. Two other Crown witnesses, Irwin and Brodner, were standing on

[Page 610]

the southwest corner of
Hastings street and Jackson avenue, when they saw two Chinamen run from the
northwest corner of Pender street and Jackson avenue (Pender street being one
street south and parallel with Hastings street) across Jackson avenue in a
northeasterly direction, followed by a third Chinaman who was calling to them
in Chinese and gesticulating with his arms, and when the two men reached the
curb on the east side of Jackson avenue the rearmost of the two men turned and fired a shot
at the man following, who fell. He then ""paused,"" stooped down and
fired two more shots at him and he and his companion then ran northeasterly
across the vacant lot. The accused attempted to prove an alibi by
several Chinese witnesses who swore he was in Victoria from the 2nd until the
12th of November, 1932. The accused was convicted. On appeal the conviction of
McDonald J. was affirmed by an equal division of the Court. Counsel for the
accused contended before this Court that the trial judge should have instructed
the jury that the accused was entitled to have them consider any alternative
defence the supporting facts of which appear in the record, and that, as the
record shewed that the complainant was chasing the accused, waving his arms and
shouting in Oriental, such conduct was sufficient, if the jury believed the
evidence, to bring into play the sections of the Criminal Code  relating to
provocation and self defence. He contended that the failure of the trial judge
to adequately instruct the jury on the issue of self defence, was a
misdirection which entitled the accused to a new trial. Counsel for the accused
also contended that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the
question of intent, and erred in his charge in not explicitly and fully
instructing the jury as to the legal consequences flowing from the two
contradictory stories, in respect to the conduct of the parties prior to the
shooting, as related by the complainant on one side, and Irwin and Bodner on
the other.

Held that, under the circumstances of this case, there
was no duty on the trial judge to instruct the jury on the issues of
provocation or self defence. If it were material to the accused to prove that
the words shouted in Oriental by the complainant amounted to provocation the
onus was upon him to prove what the words were. In any event provocation, which
would reduce murder to manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid.
Shooting in self defence would constitute a valid defence provided the accused
brings himself within sections 53 and 54 of the Code. It is justifiable to
repel an unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is not meant to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is necessary for the
purpose of self defence. It is justified, even if it does cause death or
grievous bodily harm, if it is done under reasonable apprehension of death or
grievous bodily harm to himself, and if he believes, on reasonable grounds,
that it is necessary for his own preservation. There is no evidence in the
record from which a jury could reasonably infer that the accused when he shot
the complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or bodily harm
to himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise save
himself from bodily injury. Such evidence is not in the record. The rule,
therefore, that an accused person at trial is entitled to have the jury pass
upon all his alternative defences is limited to the defences of which a
foundation of fact appears in the record.

[Page 611]

Even then the rule is not
without exception, and one exception is, that it has no application where the
accused by his defence (alibi) which he sets up at the trial, has negatived the
alternative defence for which he afterwards seeks a new trial.

The trial judge instructed the
jury as follows: ""If you believe that the accused did what the witnesses
say was done by the man who assailed the complainant then he would be guilty of
the charge laid."" Counsel for the accused contended that there was
misdirection, because the trial judge's statement meant that the accused would
be guilty of the crime charged irrespective of his intent, if the jury accepted
the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that the complainant was pursuing the other
two.

Held that the language used by the trial judge is not
open to the meaning sought to be put upon it. It was intended to mean, and
would be understood by the jury to mean, that if the accused shot and wounded
the complainant, with a revolver, in the manner described by the three persons
who witnessed the shooting, the accused would be guilty of wounding with intent
to murder; or, in other words, if the shooting took place in the manner
detailed by the witnesses, the intent was obvious and would be implied. More
than that if, under the circumstances of this case, the jury had, without any
explanation from the accused as to his intent, reached the conclusion that
intent to murder was not established, the verdict would have been perverse.

Held also that, as to the
inconsistencies between the evidence of the witnesses, Irwin and Bodner, and
that of the complainant as to the actions of the parties before the shooting
took place, it was for the jury to consider those inconsistencies if they
thought they were material; and the jury must have given them full
consideration and rejected them because they did not throw any light upon the
shooting or the intent of the accused.

Judgment of the Court of
Appeal (48 B.C. Rep. 24) aff.

APPEAL by the accused from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1], dismissing his appeal on equal division of the
Court from his conviction by D. A. McDonald J., and a jury, for murder.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are fully stated in the head-note and in the
judgment now reported.

W. B. Farris K.C. for the
appellant.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LAMONT J.—This is an appeal from
the decision of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[2] affirming, by an equal division of the court, the
conviction of the accused,

[Page 612]

J. G. Wu (alias Wu Chuck), in the
Supreme Court of British Columbia, following the verdict of the jury.

The accused was charged:

That at the city of
Vancouver in the county and province aforesaid, on the sixth day of November in
the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, J. G. Wu, alias
Wu Chuck, unlawfully did wound Wong Toy with intent thereby then and there to
murder the said Wong Toy, ***

The charge raised two points for
consideration, first as to the wounding and second as to the intent.

That Wong Toy was wounded at the
time and place stated in the indictment is established. He was found by police
constable Carstairs, a little before 6
 p.m. on November 6, 1932, lying in a
pool of blood about fifty feet north of the northeast corner of Jackson avenue
and Pender street with three bullet wounds in his body. The manner in
which he received his wounds was testified to by three witnesses. First there
was Wong Toy himself. He is a Chinese labour contractor and his story is: that,
about 5.45 p.m., on November 6, 1932, he was walking along the west side of
Jackson avenue in the city of Vancouver going towards Pender street when he
observed that the accused was following him. He then began to walk faster and,
looking back over his shoulder, saw that the accused had also accelerated his
speed. He then began to run, heading southeast across Jackson avenue, and the
accused chased after him and reached the sidewalk on the east side of Jackson
avenue about the time he (Wong Toy) reached it; that the accused drew a
revolver, pointed it at him and fired. The shot struck him in the leg about
four inches above the knee and caused him to drop to the sidewalk; that, as he
was sitting on the sidewalk leaning on his arm with his hand on the ground, the
accused came up close, stooped down and took $90 out of his pocket; that he
(Wong Toy) then shouted ""Hold-up, hold-up"" and that the accused fired
two more shots at him, hitting him on the right loin near the point of the
thigh and also on the right shoulder breaking his collar-bone; that the accused
then ran northeast across a vacant lot lying just east of Ferrera Court, which
building is on the corner of Jackson avenue and East Hastings street. Wong Toy
was taken to the hospital and found to be very severely wounded. He positively
identified the accused as his assailant and said he had known him more than two
years.

[Page 613]

Two other persons were eye
witnesses of the shooting. They were Elmer G. Irwin and James Bodner. They
testified that they were standing on the southwest corner of Jackson avenue
and Hastings street and that they had a clear view of Jackson avenue.
They say they saw two men running in a northeasterly direction angling across Jackson avenue,
followed by a third who was running after them and waving his arms and shouting
in Oriental. Irwin's story is that as they approached the sidewalk on the east
side of Jackson avenue, the rearmost of the two men turned and fired at the
third man who was within a few feet of him; that after the shot was fired the
one who did the shooting paused and then ""he kind of stooped a little bit
and fired two other shots."" He says that he and Bodner were more than half
a block from where the shooting took place (the plan drawn to scale shews that
they were about 250 feet away); that the night was ""kind of dark, a little
foggy, just getting dusk."" He was asked if the man who did the shooting or
his companion had touched the body of the victim, and he replied ""I don't
think they touched, I didn't see it anyway."" After the shooting Irwin says
he and Bodner went to where the victim was lying but they did not know him,
neither had they recognized the man who did the shooting. This man, after
firing the third shot, turned and ran in the direction of Ferrera Court.

Bodner testified that when they
first saw the third man pursuing the other two he was a few yards behind them,
and, that when the two in advance reached the curb of the sidewalk, the pursuer
was almost up to them; that one of the pursued turned and shot the pursuer and
brought him to his knees; that, after firing the first shot, an interval of
about one minute elapsed when the man who had fired the shot stepped up close
to the victim and fired two more shots at him. Bodner denied that the shooter
had touched the victim with his hands. After firing the third shot he says he
turned and ran toward the back of Ferrera
 Court. The night was about half light
and a little foggy.

Four other persons were in the
neighbourhood at the time of the shooting and they were called as witnesses by
counsel for the Crown. Two of them were Chinese, Wong Lee Fong and Gong Fay. At
the time of the shooting 

[Page 614]

these two were walking westerly
along Hastings street when they heard a shot fired, and then two more, and,
shortly afterwards, they saw the accused—whom they both had known for between
two and three years—emerging from between the two sign-boards on the vacant lot
just east of Ferrera Court on Hastings street. When they first saw him he had a
revolver in his hand and was running, but he put the revolver in his pocket
when he came to a puddle of water lying between the two sign-boards, then,
plunging through the water, he ran across Hastings
 street about ten paces in front of
them. They then went down Jackson avenue to where Wong Toy was lying.

The other two witnesses were
brothers, Jack Massey and Cyrus Massey. They were walking east on Hastings
street near Ferrera Court when they heard the noise of three shots, but thought
it was the bursting of fire-crackers. They say that about a second or so after
they heard these explosions a man ran out from between the sign-boards on the
vacant lot just east of Ferrera Court, and ran across Hastings street and then turned
towards Princess street. Their attention was attracted when he plunged into
the water between the sign-boards. Jack Massey did not attempt to identify the
accused but his brother Cyrus did. The probative value of his identification
was, however, greatly weakened by his admission that he did not see the
accused's face but identified him by his size and, that, before the preliminary
examination at the police station at which he identified the accused, a Chinaman
had shewn him a photograph of the accused and told him that that was the man
and asked him if he would recognize the man represented by the photograph as
the man who ran across Hastings street on the occasion in question.

On the evening of November 6,
after the shooting, an information was sworn out in Vancouver against the
accused, but it is established that he went over to Victoria and, under the
name of Mark Ark (a name by which he was not known in Vancouver), sailed for
China on November 12th on the ss. President Taft (the first boat to sail
from Victoria for China after November 6th). When he was asked by the
immigration officer for his photograph for identification on his return, he
told the officer that he was not returning to Canada. He was arrested in Hong 

[Page 615]

Kong on December 20th on a charge
of attempted murder, and arrived back in Vancouver January 16th,
 1933.

At the trial the only defence he
set up was that, on November 6th, 1932, he was in Victoria,
B.C., and not in Vancouver at all, and he brought a number of Chinese witnesses
from Victoria to establish his alibi. Two of them swore that they
saw the accused in Victoria on November
 2, 1932, and every day thereafter until
he sailed for China on the 12th. Another testified that he saw him in Victoria on
November 3rd, and each subsequent day until the 12th. A fourth witness
testified that he was present at a banquet given to the accused by his brother-in-law,
N. G. Hong, on November 6th; that the banquet commenced around 5.30 p.m. and
was all over by seven o'clock, when they went home. The accused did not give
evidence at the trial.

The jury rejected the evidence as
to the accused being in Victoria at the time of the shooting and found him guilty of
the charge as laid. The trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment for life.

The accused appealed to the Court
of Appeal but that court, by an equal division, affirmed the conviction. The
accused now appeals to this Court.

The chief reasons put forward on
behalf of the accused for the granting of a new trial are:

1. That the trial judge
instructed the jury as follows:

If you believe that the
accused did what the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the
complainant then he would be guilty of the charge laid.

that this was a misdirection

(a) Because in effect it
withdrew from the consideration of the jury the question of provocation and the
issue of self-defence, which defence, it was contended, was still available to
the accused notwithstanding that the jury rejected his alibi.

(b) that the statement
meant that if the jury accepted the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that Wong Toy
was the pursuer, that nevertheless, the accused would be guilty of the crime
charged, irrespective of his intent.

2. That the trial judge failed to
properly instruct the jury on the question of intent.

3. That the trial judge erred in
his charge in not explicitly and fully instructing the jury as to the legal con-

[Page 616]

sequences flowing from the two
contradictory stories, in respect to the conduct of the parties prior to the
shooting, as related by the complainant on one side, and Irwin and Bodner on
the other.

1. (a) Counsel for the
accused contended that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the
accused was entitled to have them consider any alternative defence the
supporting facts of which appear in the record, and that, as the record shewed
that the complainant was chasing the accused, waving his arms and shouting in
Oriental, such conduct was sufficient, if the jury believed the evidence, to
bring into play the sections of the Criminal Code  relating to provocation and
self defence. He contended that the failure of the trial judge to adequately
instruct the jury on the issue of self defence, was a misdirection which
entitled the accused to a new trial.

Counsel for the Crown pointed out
that the trial judge had instructed the jury on the question of self defence
and had read to them sections 53  and 54  of the Criminal Code  which set out the
law on the subject, and contended that such instruction was sufficient to
enable the jury to pass upon the issue.

There is no doubt that in the
trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all
alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and,
in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that
foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or
otherwise. What is essential is, that the record contains evidence which, if
accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid.
Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the
attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.
The only evidence appearing in the record upon which even an argument could be
founded that the accused shot in self defence is that of Irwin and Bodner that,
prior to the shooting, the complainant was running after the accused and his
companion, waving his arms and shouting in Oriental. What he was saying we do
not know. If it were material to the defence to prove that the words amounted
to provocation, the onus was upon the accused to prove what the words were. On
any event provocation, 

[Page 617]

which would reduce murder to
manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid. Shooting in self defence
would constitute a valid defence provided the accused brings himself within
sections 53  and 54  of the Criminal Code . It is justifiable to repel an
unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is not meant to cause death
or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is necessary for the purpose of
self defence. It is justified, even if it does cause death or grievous bodily
harm, if it is done under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily
harm to himself, and if he believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is
necessary for his own preservation. There is no evidence in the record from
which a jury could reasonably infer that the accused when he shot the
complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or bodily harm to
himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could not otherwise save
himself from bodily injury. The rule, therefore, that an accused person at
trial is entitled to have the jury pass upon all his alternative defences is
limited to the defences of which a foundation of fact appears in the record.
Even then the rule, in my opinion, is not without exception, and one exception
is, that it has no application where the accused, by the defence which he sets
up at the trial, has negatived the alternative defence for which he afterwards
seeks a new trial.

The only defence which the
accused set up at the trial was an alibi. In effect he said:

I did not shoot the
complainant as a result of provocation, neither did I shoot him in self
defence. At the time of the shooting I was in Victoria and therefore I could
not have shot either under provocation or in self defence.

It is quite true that the accused
did not go into the witness box and swear that he was in Victoria at the time
of the shooting, but that is the defence which was set up on his behalf, with
his consent and acquiescence, and which he asked the court to accept, and, in
my opinion, he is bound by it. The defence that the accused was in Victoria at
the time of the shooting was not only inconsistent with, but it negatived the
defence now sought to be set up. Under these circumstances I fail to see how
any duty could rest on the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider an
alternative defence which the accused, by the defence he did set up, declared
had no foundation in fact.

[Page 618]

In Rex v. Philpot[3],
the Court of Criminal Appeals in England held that upon an application for a new trial the
court would not entertain a case for the appellant inconsistent with the
defence set up at the trial. At page 143, Lord Alverstone, Chief Justice, in
giving the judgment of the court, said:—

It would be a great danger
if people could conduct cases on one line in the Court of first instance, and,
when that was unsuccessful, conduct them on another line in the Court of
Appeal. No case ought to be urged in this Court which is inconsistent with the
case set up in the Court below.

and in Rex v. Deane[4],
it was held, upon an appeal from a conviction, that

the Court will not entertain
a defence which was not, but which could have been, set up at the trial.

The accused did not at the trial
claim that he shot in self defence. He could not have set up that defence
without endangering everything he hoped to achieve by his alibi.

I am, therefore, of opinion that,
under the circumstances of this case, there was no duty on the trial judge to
instruct the jury on the issue of self defence. But, assuming such a duty to
exist, the trial judge, by explaining to the jury the extent to which, and the
circumstances under which, a person unlawfully assailed was justified in using
force to defend himself, did, in my opinion, sufficiently instruct them to
enable them to properly pass upon the issue.

1. (b) I entirely disagree
with the meaning sought to be placed on the trial judge's statement that the
accused would be guilty of the crime charged irrespective of his intent, if the
jury accepted the evidence of Irwin and Bodner that Wong Toy was pursuing the
other two. The judge's statement makes no reference as to which was the
aggressor. The trial judge simply states that if they believe that the accused
did what the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant, he
would be guilty of the charge laid. It will be observed that he is referring
there to what the witnesses said, not to what any one witness said. Now what
did the witnesses say was done by the man who assailed the complainant? There
were three witnesses who saw what the assailant did, and they all agree that he
shot and wounded the complainant. That is what the as-

[Page 619]

sailant did. The complainant
himself goes a little further and says that his assailant robbed him as well,
but, as the accused is not charged with robbery, that phase of it does not seem
to me to be material because the statement simply says that the accused would
be guilty of the charge laid and the charge laid was wounding with intent to
murder. The language used by the trial judge, in my opinion, is not open to the
meaning sought to be put upon it. It means, and I am satisfied, was intended to
mean, and would be understood by the jury to mean, that if the accused shot and
wounded the complainant, with a revolver, in the manner described by the three
persons who witnessed the shooting, the accused would be guilty of wounding with
intent to murder; or, in other words, if the shooting took place in the manner
detailed by the witnesses, the intent was obvious and would be implied. If,
therefore, the trial judge was right in his law—that the wounding, under the
circumstances, implied an intent to murder—he not only succinctly stated the
law but placed it before the jury in a manner which enabled them to easily
understand their duty in respect both to the facts and the law.

In Rex v. Monkhouse[5],
the accused was charged with wounding with intent to murder, and Coleridge J.
on the question of intent charged the jury as follows:—

It is a general rule in
criminal law and one founded on common sense that juries are to presume a man
to do what is the natural consequence of his act. The consequence is sometimes
so apparent as to leave no doubt of the intention. A man could not put a
pistol, which he knew to be loaded, to another's head and fire it off without
intending to kill him; but even there the state of mind of the party is most
material to be considered. For instance if such an act were done by a born
idiot the intent to kill could not be inferred from the act. ***

Under such circumstances as
these, where the act is unambiguous if the defendant was sober, I should have
no difficulty in directing you that he had the intent to take away life, where
death had ensued the crime would have been murder.

The same principle was laid down
in Rex v. Howlett[6]:
In that case the prisoner was indicted for wounding John Allen, with a tin can,
with intent to murder him. In summing up to the jury Baron Alderson, after
pointing out that they would have to consider whether, in case death had
ensued, the accused would have been guilty of murder, instructed them as
follows:—

[Page 620]

When a deadly weapon, such as
a knife, a sword, or gun is used, the intent of the party is manifest; but with
an instrument such as the present (a tin can), you must consider, whether the
mode in which it was used satisfactorily shews that the prisoner intended to
inflict some serious or grievous bodily harm with it.

In the case at bar there could be
no doubt that had death ensued from the shooting the accused must have been
guilty of murder. Therefore, in view of these authorities, I am of opinion that
the trial judge was quite right in instructing the jury that if they found that
the accused wounded the complainant with a revolver in the manner described by
the witnesses, his intent to murder was obvious and would be implied. This
objection to the judge's charge therefore fails.

In addition to what I have
already said on the question of intent, I would be prepared to go further and
hold that if, under the circumstances of this case, the jury had, without any
explanation from the accused as to his intent, reached the conclusion that intent
to murder was not established, the verdict would be perverse. What were the
circumstances? The accused had shot the complainant and brought him to his
knees. The complainant was either kneeling on the ground or partially sitting
on the sidewalk, leaning on his hands. The accused could see that he had no
weapon in his hands, and the hospital authorities have established that he had
no weapons on him. Having the complainant at his mercy, the accused makes a
perceptible pause, then stoops down when close to the complainant and fires two
more shots into him. What was the object of stooping? The complainant says to
steal his money. The only other suggestion was (and that was by counsel for the
accused) that he stooped for the purpose of getting a better shot, or a shot at
him in front. The complainant was evidently facing the accused on his hands and
knees, for all shots took effect in front, and it may be that the accused
stooped so as to be able to shoot him in front with the last two shots. If that
be the explanation of the stooping it only demonstrates that the intention of
the accused was to murder him. If the stooping was to rob him he was equally
guilty. As there was abundant evidence that the accused did the shooting, the
jury, in my opinion, in the absence of any explanation of his intention 

[Page 621]

by the accused, were quite right
in holding that the intent was sufficiently apparent to justify them in
convicting the accused.

3. Counsel for the accused seemed
to be of opinion that, where the counsel for the Crown calls witnesses who give
inconsistent stories, he is under an obligation to in some way reconcile these
stories, otherwise the jury should take the inconsistencies as shewing that the
Crown has failed to establish the charge. In my opinion counsel for the Crown
is under no such obligation. I have always understood that it was the duty of
the Crown counsel to place before the court the evidence of those who were eye
witnesses of the crime with which the accused was charged, whether they give evidence
which is consistent with the commission of the crime by the accused or
otherwise. I have always considered that counsel for the Crown was in the
position of an officer of the court whose duty is to get at the truth
irrespective of whether or not the evidence supports the Crown's case. And,
when he has put in the evidence of the eye witnesses, he can leave it to the
jury to say which of the witnesses they will believe and how much of the
testimony of each they will accept.

The evidence of the witnesses,
Irwin and Bodner, is inconsistent with that of the complainant as to the
actions of the parties before the shooting took place, it was therefore for the
jury to consider those inconsistencies if they thought they were material; and
I have no doubt the jury gave them full consideration and rejected them because
they did not throw any light upon the shooting or the intent of the accused.

Considering the charge of the
trial judge as a whole and the evidence as it appears in the record I see no
good reason for differing with the majority of the Court of Appeal. I would,
therefore, affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Statements made by accused in
the presence of several police officers, who were not produced as
witnesses—Admissibility in evidence of such statements—Inquiry by trial judge
as to voluntary character of—Not a mere matter of discretion for trial
judge—Declaration by accused as to previous arrest.

The Court, reversing the judgment of the
Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, quashed a conviction for murder and granted
a new trial, on the ground that a statement in writing alleged to have been
made by the appellant to certain police officers has been improperly received
in evidence upon his trial. Sankey v. The King ([1927] S.C.R.
436) foll. and Rex v. Seabrooke (58 C.C.C. 323) ref.

Determination of any question raised as to
the voluntary character of a statement by an accused elicited by
interrogatories administered by police officers is not a mere matter of
discretion for the trial judge. Where such a statement is elicited in the
presence of several officers, the statement ought, as a rule, not to be
admitted unless (in the absence of some adequate explanation of their absence)
those who were present are produced by the Crown as witnesses, at least for
cross-examination on behalf of the accused; and, where the statement professes
to give the substance of a report of oral answers given by the

[Page 510]

accused to interrogatories, without
reproducing the questions, then the written report ought not to be admitted in
evidence unless the person who is responsible for its compilation is (here
again in the absence of some adequate explanation of his absence) called as a
witness.

Upon the evidence, although the document was
read over to the appellant before he signed it, it was not, in one most
important particular, a correct statement of what the accused appellant said
and intended to say. Moreover the statement made by the accused in this case
contained a declaration that he had been once arrested “for a fight * * * and I
had paid the costs.” The fact that the accused had been arrested for a criminal
offence and had paid “the costs” could not be competent evidence—not only on
the ground that the fact itself would be in law wholly irrelevant, but on
account of the unfair prejudice to the accused which would be the likely effect
of the reception of evidence of it; and a document professing to embody
admissions obtained as the admissions of the accused were in this case, which
included a record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible against
him, and which was calculated to prejudice him, could not properly be received
in evidence. It might in a proper case be used by a witness to refresh his
memory; but the use of the document itself as evidence could not be justified.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upon leave to appeal granted by this
Court[1],
sustaining the conviction of the appellant, on his trial before Laliberté J.
and a jury, on a charge of murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material
facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are
sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed; the
conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.

Lucien Gendron K.C. and Leopold
Pinsonnault for the appellant.

V. Bienvenue K.C. and P. Biguë K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Duff C.J.—This appeal
raises a question as to the admissibility in evidence, upon the appellant’s
trial for murder, of a statement in writing alleged to have been made by him to
certain officers of the provincial police of Quebec.

The indictment charged

Que le ou vers le 4 mars 1932., en la
paroisse de Ste.-Thècle, district des Trois-Rivières, Donat Thiffault, de la
dite paroisse de Ste-Thècle, dit district, s’est rendu coupable de l’acte
criminel qualifié meurtre, en mettant et faisant mettre volontairement le feu à
sa maison d’habitation,

[Page 511]

dans la dite paroisse de Ste-Thècle, laquelle
maison fut incendiée, avec l’intention de causer la mort de Bertha Gervais, son épouse, et en causant par
là effectivement la mort de la dite Bertha Gervais, sa dite épouse, qui. mourut dans le dit incendie. Le tout sans
justification ni excuse et contrairement au code criminel canadien et ses
amendements.

As we have come to the conclusion that there
must be a new trial, our references to the facts will be limited to such as
appear to be necessary to make clear the considerations affecting the points in
dispute.

The appellant, at the time of the burning of his
house on the night of the 3rd and 4th of March, 1932, was living alone in the
house with his wife and one of his sons. His wife was sleeping upstairs. It was
an important part of the case for the Crown that the fire which caused her
death did not originate in the wood stove in the first story or in the furnace
in the cellar. Witnesses were called who stated that the cellar was cold and
that it was evident that the furnace had not been heated that night. There was
a fire of no importance in the wood box beside the stove in the first storey,
but that was easily and quickly extinguished. The fire in which Mrs. Thiffault
lost her life in the second storey was, the Crown contended, and witnesses
deposed, an independent fire which had originated in that storey where there
was no stove or other heating apparatus.

The evidence adduced by the Crown consisted very
largely of accounts of various instances of suspicious conduct and of
incriminating statements of the accused himself. These, the Crown contended,
pointed to a determination to burn the house in order to collect the insurance
money and to get rid of his wife. A good deal was made of an incident in which
his wife was said to have charged him with attempting to get her to drink
ether. Much was also made of a conversation which was alleged to be, in effect,
a proposal of marriage by the accused a few days before the fire accompanied by
a prediction that he would soon be a widower.

In view of the nature of the case made by the
Crown, the written statement received in evidence was plainly calculated to
incriminate the appellant as shewing that he had given a false account of the
origin of the fire, and as admitting that he entertained projects of marriage
soon after his wife’s death and that he was about to leave the province when he
was detained by the police. The admission

[Page 512]

that the house which he had insured for $1,500
was bought for $800 and that he had received $3,500 as the result of a fire two
years before was also gravely compromising, in view of the evidence adduced by
the Crown of conversations in which he had spoken of insurance as a very useful
thing and had said that his brother had profited by insurance to the extent of
$16,000.

The text of the document objected to is as
follows:

Ma femme était couchée en haut, dans la nuit
du 3 au 4 mars 1932, ainsi que mon
fils Florent Thiffault. Je me suis aperçu du feu vers 1.00
hr. du matin. La boucane m’a réveillé, j’ai traversé de ma
chambre à la cuisine et j’ai ouvert la porte pour crier: “Au feu”. En partant
pour monter en haut, mon garçon est tombé en bas dans l’escalier, je l’ai
ramassé dans l’escalier et jeté dehors. Il avait une épaule démanchée et la
tête fendue. Le Dr. Aubin en a pris soin. C’est le seul qui était couché en
haut. Un nommé Magnan est arrivé avec un extincteur. Quand on a vu qu’on ne
pouvait pas sauver en haut, nous avons sauvé le ménage en bas. J’ai acheté un
gallon d’éther à Shawinigan mais je ne connais pas qui me l’a vendu. Mon épouse
a fait analyser l’éther par le Dr. Aubin de Ste-Thècle. Le soir du feu, je suis
allé chez Magnan (Charles). (Je veux parler de la soirée précédant le feu), je
suis entré chez Anselme Baril et Philomène Béland, vers 6.30 ou 7 hrs. je suis parti vers 9 hrs.
moins quart. Ensuite je suis allé chez Davidson, le barbier, j’ai veillé là
jusqu’à 10.30 avec Alexandre
Moisan. Là, je suis parti à la maison.

La cause du feu est un feu de fournaise, la
fournaise chauffait au bois. Le feu était pris le long du tuyau en montant. La
dimension de la maison en dehors 26 pieds carrés, en bas de la maison il y avait 4 appartements. En haut, 4 appartements
et un passage.

J’ai retiré $1,500.00 d’assurances sur la maison et $1,700.00 sur le ménage. J’étais assuré pour le feu par M. A. I. Gravel, de Trois-Rivières. L’assurance a été
prise par M. Arthur Guillemette, de Ste-Thècle. J’étais assuré depuis quatre
ans. Ça fait un an que j’ai cette maison et j’ai continué à payer les
assurances pour le feu. J’ai payé la maison $800.00 et elle était assurée pour $1,500.00 J’ai déjà passé au feu à Ste-Thècle il y a 2 ans; j’ai reçu $3,500.00 d’assurances.
J’avais été assuré par M. M. Guillemette et Gravel. Je n’ai jamais été arrêté pour vol ni pour vente de boisson; j’ai été
arrêté une fois pour bataille à Harvey Jonction et j’ai payé les frais. Je n’ai jamais proposé à une femme que
nous pourrions nous marier prochainement alors que ma femme vivait. Personne n’a
brisé de vitres ou enfoncé la porte pour entrer dans la maison lors du feu
alors que j’étais dans la cuisine. Je devais rencontrer Mme Emile Comeau, le 21 juillet, pour question de mariage mais quand
j’ai vu le détective à Ste-Thècle, j’ai vu qu’il se brassait quelque chose et
je ne me suis pas rendu chez Mme Comeau et j’avais décidé de partir pour Hertz,
Ontario, le 25 juillet; je n’ai
pas mis mon projet à exécution parce que la police est venu me chercher. C’est
moi qui ai fait du feu dans la fournaise le dernier et il était environ 10.30 p.m. j’ai fait un feu de bois et la
fournaise était dans la cave. Un “drum” à gazoline servait de fournaise, et je ne suis pas descendu dans la
cave entre minuit et une heure; je n’ai
pas entendu crier ni plaindre ni ma femme ni mon fils, et j’ai signé.

[Page 513]

The circumstances in which the document was
procured are these: The coroner on the adjournment of the inquest on the 23rd
of July directed Mitchell, a provincial constable, to arrest and detain the
accused as a material witness. The accused was, accordingly, taken into custody
at Ste. Thécle and was
conducted by Tremblay, the deputy chief of detectives, accompanied by Mitchell,
to Quebec. He was there detained at the quarters of the provincial police until
the following morning, when, in the presence of Tremblay and Mitchell and one
Chouinard, a clerk, he was interrogated by the chief of detectives Lemire. It
is quite evident, from the record made, that Lemire’s questions were directed,
not only to ascertaining the connection of the accused with the fire in which
his wife lost her life, but also to obtaining admissions of damaging facts in
his past history. It was obviously on the face of it an interrogation for the
purpose of procuring admissions which could be used in evidence against the
accused. A record of what the accused said was drawn up by Chouinard as the
examination proceeded, and this was afterwards read over to the accused, who
signed it.

Although the summary compiled by Chouinard and
signed by Thiffault is expressed in the first person, it is not a verbatim
report of what occurred. The questions are not given and the summary could only
be, at best, on the face of it, a statement of Chouinard’s interpretation of
the substance of the answers to the interrogatories administered.

There are two decisive objections to the
admission of the document.

First, the evidence points to the conclusion
that, although the document was read over to him before he signed it, it is not
a correct statement of what the accused said and intended to say. Admittedly,
there is one most serious error. It was part of the Crown’s case against him
that he had procured ether for the purpose of putting into effect some noxious
design against his wife. Being interrogated as regards his possession of ether,
his answer was that he had bought, as he thought, whisky, and had discovered
afterwards that they had given him ether. The signed statement not only
disregards the explanation, but converts the explanation into an admission that
he had purchased ether

[Page 514]

—an admission most material to support the case
for the Crown. In view of this admitted mis-statement of what the accused had
said, it seems to us to be quite plain that the document containing it ought
not to have been admitted, at all events in the absence of explanation by
Chouinard, who had compiled it.

There is a cognate objection which, apart from
everything else, seems to establish the inadmissibility of the document. It
contains a declaration that the accused had been once arrested “pour bataille *
* * et j’ai payé les frais.” The fact that the accused had been arrested for a
criminal offence and had paid “les frais” could, of course, not be competent
evidence—not only on the ground that the fact itself would be in law wholly
irrelevant, but on account of the unfair prejudice to the accused which would
be the likely effect of the reception of evidence of it; and we think that a
document professing to embody admissions obtained as the admissions of the
accused were, which includes a record of an admission of a fact that would be
inadmissible against him, and which was calculated to prejudice him, could not properly
be received in evidence. It, no doubt, might in a proper case be used by a
witness to refresh his memory; but the use of the document itself as evidence
could not be justified.

The second objection is on the ground that the
voluntary character of the statement signed by the accused has not been
established. The law governing the decision on the point raised by this
objection was stated in a judgment of this Court in Sankey v. The
King[2], in the
course of which it was said,

We feel, however, that we should not part
from this case without expressing our view that the proof of the voluntary
character of the accused’s statement to the police, which was put in evidence
against him, is most unsatisfactory. That statement, put in writing by the
police officer, was obtained only upon a fourth questioning to which the
accused was subjected on the day following his arrest. Three previous attempts
to lead him to “talk” had apparently proved abortive—why, we are left to
surmise. The accused, a young Indian, could neither read nor write. No
particulars are vouchsafed as to what transpired at any of the three previous “interviews”;
and but meagre details are given of the process by which the written statement
ultimately signed by the appellant was obtained. We think that the police
officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed all that took
place on each of the occasions when he “interviewed” the prisoner; and, if
another policeman was present,

[Page 515]

as the defendant swore at the trial, his
evidence should have been adduced before the statement was received in
evidence. With all the facts before him, the learned judge should form his own
opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary as the basis
for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the police officer,
who had obtained it, that it was made “ voluntarily and freely.”

It should always be borne in mind that
while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly
conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render his
statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the
satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or
statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always
rests with the Crown. (The King v. Bellos[3]; Presko v. The King[4]. That burden can rarely, if ever, be
discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the
customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer,
who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.

This judgment was applied, and rightly applied
we think, by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Seabrooke[5]. It results from this statement of the law
that the determination of any question raised as to the voluntary character of
a statement by the accused elicited by interrogatories administered by the
police is not a mere matter of discretion for the trial judge, as the court
below appears to have thought. Where such a statement is elicited in the
presence of several officers, the statement ought, as a rule, not to be
admitted unless (in the absence of some adequate explanation of their absence)
those who were present are produced by the Crown as witnesses, at least for
cross-examination on behalf of the accused; and, where the statement professes
to give the substance of a report of oral answers given by the accused to
interrogatories, without reproducing the questions, then the written report
ought not to be admitted in evidence unless the person who is responsible for
its compilation is (here again in the absence of some adequate explanation of
his absence) called as a witness.

In the present case there are exceptionally
powerful reasons for applying these rules strictly. The Deputy Chief of
Detectives Tremblay who accompanied the accused from Ste. Thècle with Mitchell
and was present throughout the interrogatories was not produced. Mitchell was
called but only after the document had been admitted. No explanation is
proffered of the absence of Tremblay. As to

[Page 516]

the clerk Chouinard, it was especially important
that his evidence should be before the court, because, first, as already
observed, the statement written by him was in reality a summary of what he
judged to be the substance of the answers given by the accused; and second,
because of the proved inaccuracy of the statement in one most important
particular.

We can entertain no doubt that, upon the
principle elucidated in the judgment of this Court in Sankey v. The
King (1), the admission of this document cannot be supported.

We were asked to dismiss the appeal upon the
ground that, even if not strictly admissible, the document added nothing to the
weight of the evidence supplied from other sources. We are not satisfied that
no substantial wrong, within the meaning of sec. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code ,
has occurred in virtue of the improper reception of this document. We are
unable to reach the conclusion that, to use the language of the Judicial
Committee in Makin v. A.G. for N.S.W. (2), that

it is impossible to suppose that the
evidence improperly admitted * * * can have had any influence on the verdict of
the jury.

The conviction must be quashed and, in the
circumstances, we think there should be a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Combine—Conspiracy—Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26—Cr. Code, s. 498 (1) (a) (b)
(d)—Sufficiency of findings to establish guilt—Findings of participation in
original scheme, but not of participation in subsequent overt acts—Misdirection
of himself by trial judge—Appeal by Attorney-General from acquittal at
trial—Cr. Code, s. 1013 (4), as enacted in 1980, c. 11, s. 28—“Question of
law”—Objection to form of indictment and conviction.

Appellants were acquitted by Wright J.,
[1931] O.R. 202, on charges of offences against the Combines Investigation
Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy, in violation of s. 498, subs.
1 (a), (b) and (d), of the Cr. Code, but,
upon appeal by the Attorney-General under s. 1013 (4) of the Cr. Code, as
enacted in 1930, c. 11, s. 28, they were convicted by the Appellate Division,
[1931] O.R. 699. They appealed.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

The trial judge’s material findings of fact
were fully justified on the evidence and established appellants’ guilt. The
trial judge misdirected himself, in that, while finding that appellants had
taken an active part in the original scheme—the formation of the organizations
in question which, as found, amounted to the formation of an illegal combine,
and to a conspiracy within s. 498, Cr. Code—yet he acquitted them on the
ground that they were not proved to have taken part in subsequent overt acts.
The original scheme constituted the conspiracy

[Page 280]

which formed the basis for the prosecution;
the overt acts were not the conspiracy, though evidence of its existence. It
was not essential to a finding of appellants’ guilt, that they be held to have
had actual knowledge of, or to have actually participated in, the subsequent
overt acts. Once it is established that a combine or conspiracy existed, it is
unnecessary, to warrant conviction for the formation of a combine, or of the
agreement to conspire, to shew accused’s complicity in subsequent illegal acts
done by, or with the connivance of, the body against members of which
conspiracy or unlawful combine is charged; provided there is sufficient proof
of their complicity in the original formation of the combine, or in the
agreement charged as conspiracy.

While the Attorney-General’s right of
appeal, conferred by s. 1013 (4), is confined to “questions of law,” this does
not exclude the appellate court’s right, where a conclusion of mixed law and
fact, such as is the accused’s guilt or innocence, depends, as in the present
case, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made, to enquire into
the soundness of that conclusion, which must be regarded as a question of
law—especially where, as in this case, it is a clear result of misdirection of
himself in law by the trial judge.

Held, further,
that appellants’ objection to the form of the indictment, based on the ground
that there were several offences charged in the alternative, and to the form of
the convictions (which strictly followed the form of the indictment), could not
be sustained; they expressed the offences in the very terms of the statutes. (Cr.
Code, ss. 852 (3), 854, 1010 (2), cited).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1],
which allowed the appeal of the Attorney-General of Ontario from the judgment
of Wright J.[2]
acquitting the present appellants on charges of offences against the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy contrary to the
provisions of s. 498, subs. (1) (a), (b) and (d), of
the Criminal Code . The Appellate Division set aside the acquittal of the
present appellants and adjudged them guilty.

W.F. O’Connor K.C. for the appellants.

D.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.C. McRuer K.C.
for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—These two appeals were heard
together.

The appellants, Belyea and Weinraub, were both
acquitted2 on trial before Wright, J., without a jury, (R.S.C.,
1927, ch. 26, s. 39; Cr. C., s. 581); but, upon appeal by the
Attorney-General under s. 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code , as enacted by
c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, the Appellate Division1
was of the opinion that the

 [Page 281]

learned trial judge had misdirected himself, in
that he held that, although it was proven, if not admitted, that they (the
appellants) “took an active part in the original scheme,—the conspiracy which
formed the basis for the prosecution, * * * because (they)
were not proved to have taken part in subsequent overt acts,” they should be
acquitted, saying of one of the respondents, “There is no evidence that
connects him with any of the illegal operations.” The Appellate Division found
that

Belyea and Weinraub were most active in
carrying out the projects of the conspiracy; were originally united with Singer
himself in the conspiracy of which the latter was found guilty. They should
have been convicted as were Singer, Paddon and Ward. Their part in the illegal
acts was much greater than that of Paddon and Ward, but less than that of
Singer.

Having found them guilty, that Court then
proceeded to fine each of them one-half the amount of the fine imposed upon
Singer.

After careful consideration of the evidence, of
the very lengthy argument before this Court, which lasted more than two days,
and of the “memorandum of points” and the supplementary factum of the
appellants, we are of opinion that the appeals fail and must be dismissed.

In the course of the trial, the learned judge
refused the accused leave to move to quash the indictment under s. 898 of the Cr.
C., on the ground that ss. 854 and 855 applied to it, and that s. 891 of
the Code was directly relevant. No motion under the latter section was
made on behalf of the accused. Here, this refusal of leave, although approved
by the Appellate Division, was made a substantial ground of complaint. We are
of opinion that the objection is ill-founded, being based, as it was, on the ground
that there were several offences charged in the alternative. As the Appellate
Division said, the indictments “follow the Statutes under which they are laid,
and their form is sanctioned by ss. 852, 954 (sic.) and 1010 (2)
of the Code.” Having regard to ss. 852 (3), 854 and 1010 (2), the position
taken by the accused is hopeless. By s. 1010 (2) it is provided that

* * * the indictment shall, after verdict,
be held sufficient, if it describes the offence in the words of the statute
creating the offence, or prescribing the punishment, although they (sic.)
are disjunctively stated or appear to include more than one offence, or
otherwise.

[Page 282]

Upon this statutory provision being stressed by
the Court, however, counsel for the appellants sought to turn his objection
into a present objection to the form of the convictions which had strictly
followed the form of the indictment. It was pointed out to him that, in our
opinion, it was not open for him to do so. No doubt s. 852 deals with
objections to an indictment; but, as the convictions here strictly follow the
form of the indictment, and express the offences of which the accused were
found guilty in the very terms of the statutes, this point seems now to be
concluded against the appellants. (S. 1010 (2)). As Mr. McCarthy (counsel
for the Crown) put the matter to the Court, the convictions by the Appellate
Division are in the words of the statutes themselves, the offences of which the
accused were found guilty being the formation and operation of an illegal
combine contrary to the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act, as
therein defined, and conspiracy in violation of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b)
and (d), of the Criminal Code . The words “or of services,” etc.,
in the indictment are introduced merely as illustrative of the methods employed
by the accused in operating the combine, and in carrying out the conspiracy in
question. We are, accordingly, of the opinion that any objection based on the
form of the indictment, or of the convictions, cannot now be upheld.

Counsel for the appellants at the outset of the
argument stated that the question he intended to raise was whether there was
any evidence in the record to warrant the findings of the trial judge; and not
at all as to the weight of such evidence. We are, however, of the opinion
that—although, no doubt, the position so taken is sound—it is unnecessary to
rely upon that as an answer to the appeal, being of the view that the weight of
evidence fully justified, if, indeed, it did not require, all the material
findings made by the learned trial judge.

The following findings of Wright J., in the
course of his judgment, seem to us to be vital and leave no doubt as to the
appellants’ guilt. Moreover, they are all supported by the evidence. Indeed, as
stated by counsel for the appellant in his memorandum, the fact-finding of the
learned trial judge was good.

[Page 283]

After setting out the indictment, and the
circumstances leading up to the trial, and discussing the application for leave
to move to quash the indictment, the learned judge said that, in the
prosecution of this case, being the first case in the province under the Combines
Investigation Act, the whole question should be fully considered. We take
the following somewhat copious extracts from the judgment of the learned judge.
They contain the findings which we consider material:

Prior to March, 1927, there was in
existence in Ontario, an Association known as the Ontario Society of Domestic
Sanitary and Heating Engineers. This Association had been somewhat dormant for
years, but at a Convention held in Guelph in March, 1927, it was resolved to
revive the Association with a view to extend its usefulness.

At that Convention the accused Belyea and
Weinraub were elected as directors * * * Plans were then
laid to hold a meeting at a subsequent date, in order to get all the allied
trades into one organization. It was also suggested that a Commissioner with
plenary power should be appointed as head of the organization.

Next followed a letter dated March 22,
1927, from Singer to Belyea in which suggestions were made by the former as to
holding a conference to discuss the proposed new organization.

On April 9th a meeting was held in the
office of Singer at which both Weinraub and Belyea were present. At this
meeting it was temporarily arranged that Singer be paid $7,500 to organize and
incorporate a new organization. Following this meeting a letter was written by
Singer to Belyea under date of April 11, 1927, outlining the proposed objects
of the organization.

Next followed a series of speaking tours
throughout the Province in which Belyea and Weinraub took a leading part. This
was to interest the members of the different trades affected or proposed to be
affected by the formation of the new organization.

Windsor, among other centres was visited
and a meeting was held of those interested at which the accused, Belyea and
Weinraub, were present.

The only objection taken at bar by counsel for
the appellants to the accuracy of this set of findings is that he contended
that Weinraub was not present at the Windsor meeting. This, however, seems to
us to be not very material.

As a result of this campaign a largely
attended convention was held at Hamilton on June 11th, 1927, at
which * * * it was decided to proceed to form a new
association and to have a Commissioner appointed to guide and govern its
affairs.

Letters of Incorporation of the Canadian
Plumbing and Heating Guild were granted on June 30th, 1927.

It should here be noted that this incorporation
is not an incorporation as a trade union under the Trade Unions Act .

[Page 284]

Prior to the granting of this charter, the
sum of $7,500 was paid to Singer as his charges for his services in connection
with the organization and incorporation of the Guild.

The purposes and objects of the Guild as
set forth in the Letters of Incorporation did not disclose the real purposes or
objects as shown by the future operations of the Guild. Two of the accused,
namely, Belyea and Weinraub, were among the incorporators of this Guild.

The membership in the Guild included
manufacturers and wholesalers of plumbing supplies, but shortly after the
incorporation these parties became restless owing * * * to
a legal opinion received by them to the effect that it was illegal for them to
be in the same organization as the Master Plumbers, * * *

At a meeting held on the 24th of August, 1927,
by the wholesalers and manufacturers, the following resolution was passed:

That this meeting of manufacturers and
jobbers recommend to manufacturers and jobbers of plumbing and heating goods
that they become members of the Dominion Chamber of Credits Limited without any
further obligation than their subscription.

This incorporation was, likewise, not effected
under the Trade Unions Act .

It was also arranged that the application
fees already paid by manufacturers and jobbers to the Guild should be
transferred to the new organization.

* * * From what appeared in the evidence at
the trial, and the subsequent operations of the two organizations, it is quite
clear that the new organization was formed for the purpose of having two
organizations,—one consisting of Master plumbers, and the other of
manufacturers and jobbers, acting under the direction of one Commissioner and
in close contact and co-operation with each other.

A Convention was held at Toronto on January
26th and 27th, 1928, which was addressed by O’Connor at considerable length * *
*

The only objection taken at bar to the accuracy
of this finding was that Singer was not actually named as “Commissioner” for
the new, or second, organization. There was, in fact, no “Commissioner” of that
body; but Singer was in charge of, and responsible for, its operations
throughout, and the burden of his $25,000 salary was equally borne by each
body.

Shortly after this meeting, Singer
conceived the idea of another organization, and on April 13th, 1928, it was
arranged that a new organization to be known as the Amalgamated Builders
Council should be registered under the Trade Unions Act , and the same was duly
registered on the 8th day of June, 1928, with the Deputy Registrar General of
Canada, as required by the Trade Unions Act . Of this organization, the accused
Belyea was appointed President, and Weinraub as Secretary.

The President, on the 9th July, 1928,
appointed Singer as Commissioner under rule 3 of the By-laws of the new
organization.

On July 19th, 1928, Singer and O’Connor
interviewed the Department of Labour at Ottawa and submitted in writing a
document known

[Page 285]

as Canadian
Cartels * * * The document is important not for that reason
but for certain statements contained in the draft Cartel relating to the
activities of Singer and O’Connor in connection with the formation and
operation of the organization.

Certain Master Plumbers residing in
Windsor * * * made application for a charter for a local
section of the Amalgamated Builders Council and on September 25, 1928, a
charter was granted to the branch at Windsor to be designated as Local
Section No. 112. * * *

This organization continued to function
until the 31st day of December, 1929, when, after an investigation under the
Combines Investigation Act, the certificate of registration of the Amalgamated
Builders Council was cancelled by the Secretary of State and Registrar General
of Canada.

The evidence disclosed that the organizations
were the creation and creatures of Singer.

His (Singer’s) was the guiding hand
throughout the entire operation of the different organizations.

Under the terms of the by-law which will be
referred to, he was invested with wide powers, and the evidence disclosed that
he exercised them to the limit.

* *
*

The Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild was
the first to be incorporated. By reference to its charter it will appear that
its purposes or objects were very wide and embraced almost every conceivable
subject relating to the plumbing industry.

* *
*

Of these organizations Singer was the
Commissioner, Belyea was President, and Weinraub was secretary. * * *

* * * The powers of the Commissioner (were)
defined in clauses 2 and 3 of By-law No. 1 (of the Guild) which read as
follows:

“(2) The general management shall be
entrusted to a Commissioner, who shall establish and maintain the Guild and
supervise and control its policies and affairs according to his best judgment,
and in that behalf shall do and cause to be done such acts and things as he may
from time to time think necessary or desirable and shall employ such help as he
may deem necessary. He shall investigate prevailing conditions in the plumbing
and heating industry and shall oversee the gathering and distribution of
information. He shall examine prospective members as to their eligibility and
shall admit to membership those who are eligible and shall expel from
membership those who become ineligible.

“(3) The Commissioner shall have the right
to veto any resolution or by-law of the Board of Directors or any decision of
any officer.”

This organization had officials known as
Zone Chairmen in the various centres. In Windsor, one Pragnell was the first of
such Chairmen, * * *

* * * The evidence clearly established that
the Windsor group was composed solely of members of the Guild and Singer, in
his capacity of Commissioner, attended some of the meetings, and delivered
addresses to the members. * * * It is quite clear this
(Windsor) group was recognized by the chief executive officers of the Guild as
a constituent though informal branch of the organization.

Next in chronological order is the Dominion
Chamber of Credits, of which Singer was one of the incorporators, and one of
the directors. No minutes of this organization were produced at the
trial * * * The following significant clause appears among
(its) objects:

[Page 286]

“(g) To subscribe to, become
a member of, become associated and co-operate with any other association or
corporation whether incorporated or not, whose objects or purposes are
altogether or in part similar to those of the company and to procure from and
communicate to any such corporation such information as may be likely to
further the objects of the company.”

As already indicated, this organization was
formed so as to permit the manufacturers and jobbers who were members of the
Guild, to retain their connection with it under the guise of another body. The
fees already paid by them to the Guild were to be transferred to the new organization.

The last organization to be formed was the
Amalgamated Builders’ Council * * * Had it confined its
operations to those authorized by (the Trade Unions) Act , no objection could
well be taken, but from its operations it is clearly evident that the purpose
of those responsible for its creation and operation was to avail themselves of
any immunity provided by this Act, and, if possible, evade the provisions of
the Combines Investigation Act, and the Criminal Code .

Counsel for the appellants fully accepted this
finding at bar; indeed, he rather gloried in the attempt so made to evade the
law.

Of this organization Singer was the duly
appointed Commissioner. Belyea was the first president, and Weinraub was the
first secretary-treasurer. * * *

At the convention of September 3rd, 1928,
it was decided unanimously that henceforth only members of Amalgamated
Builders’ Council actually engaged in the plumbing and heating industry should
be eligible to be or to continue members of the Guild. This policy was also stated
in a circular letter of September 7th, 1928, by Singer in his capacity as
Commissioner, in the following words:

“No member will be admitted to Amalgamated
Builders’ Council unless he is a member of the Guild. Membership in the Guild
will be conditional upon membership in the Amalgamated Builders’ Council.”

Many of the foregoing findings were referred to
by counsel for the appellants, in the course of the argument, as historical in
their character. This, however, does not prevent them being findings of fact,
fully supported by evidence, and many of them material to the existence or
nonexistence of the combine or conspiracy charged.

Summarizing the essential findings of fact
contained in the foregoing, they include the following:

(a) That the Canadian Plumbing and
Heating Guild was formed as the result of an effort, in March, 1927, to revive
a dormant body, called the Ontario Society of Domestic and Sanitary Heating
Engineers, of which Belyea and Weinraub were elected as directors; the former
becoming President, and the latter, Secretary-Treasurer of the new body;

[Page 287]

(b) That Singer was the prime mover in
this and subsequent matters, being paid $7,500 by Belyea and Weinraub and their
associates as a fee for the organization and incorporation of the new body
known as the Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild;

(c) That, as a result of a speaking tour,
in which Belyea and Weinraub took a leading part, many Master Plumbers and
others were interested in the organization, Windsor being amongst the centres
visited;

(d) That Singer was appointed
Commissioner of the new body in 1927, with absolute powers and to act as the alter
ego of the directors;

(e) That the real purposes of the Guild
were not those stated in its incorporation; and that Belyea and Weinraub were
among the incorporators thereof;

(f) That the Guild membership originally
included manufacturers and wholesalers as well as master plumbers; that the
former became dissatisfied, and transferred their membership to another
organization formed under Singer’s auspices, called the “Dominion Chamber of
Credits,” of which all the wholesalers and manufacturers were urged to become
members; their subscriptions being transferred from the Guild to the Dominion
Chamber of Credits;

(g) That the new organization was formed
for the purpose of having two organizations,—the one for master plumbers, the
other for wholesalers and manufacturers, both under the full control of Singer,
and acting in close co-operation one with the other;

(h) That Singer conceived the idea
of a third organization, called the Amalgamated Builders’ Council, to be
registered under the Trade Unions Act ; of this organization Belyea was
elected President and Weinraub Secretary-Treasurer. On the 9th of July, 1928,
Belyea, as President, appointed Singer “Commissioner” of this third
organization with plenary powers;

(i) That Singer’s was the guiding
hand in all three organizations and that he was invested with the widest
possible powers, which he exercised to the limit;

(j) That membership in the Guild was
essential to membership in the Amalgamated Builders’ Council;

(k) That from the operations of
the A.B.C. it was evident that its real purposes were to avail itself of any

[Page 288]

immunity provided by the Trade Unions Act , and,
if possible, to evade the provisions of the Combines Investigation Act and
s. 498  of the Criminal Code .

(I) That, at a Convention of the
A.B.C., on September 3, 1928, it was unanimously decided that, henceforth, only
members of the A.B.C. should be eligible to membership in the Guild; and
membership in the A.B.C. should be conditional upon membership in the Guild;

(m) That the Windsor group was recognized
by the Guild as a constituent, though informal, branch of the organization.

Having made the foregoing findings, the learned
judge proceeds to sum up the situation as follows:

From the foregoing it is manifest that
these three organizations were formed and operated for the express purpose of
controlling the plumbing and heating industry in its various branches,
including manufacturing and jobbing, and to further that end absolute control
and direction of these organizations were vested in one individual styled
“Commissioner,” which in itself was a vicious and indefensible system.

Except as to styling Singer “Commissioner” of
the three organizations, an office actually held by him only in two of them,
although, in respect to the other, the Dominion Chamber of Credits, he
exercised all the powers of “Commissioner,” the accuracy of this finding as to
the purposes for which the organizations were formed and operated was not
challenged at bar.

The learned judge then proceeds to deal with a
number of overt acts which, as Mr. McCarthy informs us, were put into the
record merely to show the methods by which the conspiracy and combine was worked
out, and not at all to show the existence of the conspiracy or combine, of
which, he contends, there was abundant evidence apart from the proof of any
such overt acts.

This finding may be regarded as a further
summarizing of the nature of the purpose of the combine and conspiracy charged
and found to have existed. The evidence supports it and objections, if any,
taken to its accuracy would be futile.

The acts complained of in connection with the
Windsor group may be summarized as follows:

(a) There was a fixing of a common
price both of material and labour, as the method of computing prices of

[Page 289]

material was standardized and the cost of labour
was fixed; and also a fixing of a rate of profit to be added to cost;

(b) That the public was forced to
pay tribute to the Guild. 

The learned judge proceeds:

The evidence established that at one stage
of the operations of this organization schedules were adopted by the members
whereby 30 per cent. was to be added to the cost of the materials for labour
and to the total cost of labour and materials a further addition of 30 per
cent. was to be added as profit.

There is also proof of action by the Windsor
group towards creating a monopoly or limiting competition in the plumbing and
heating industry.

At a meeting of Local Section 112,
held on October 4, 1928, at Windsor, a resolution was adopted in the following
terms:

“Resolved that the members of this Local
ought not to purchase and after communication of this resolution will not
purchase from any supplier who directly or indirectly sells plumbing, heating
or radiation fixtures, goods, materials or systems in or about or for
installation or use in or about the border cities to persons, firms or
corporations other than members of this Local.”

The minutes show that the
secretary-treasurer was directed to communicate the foregoing resolution to
such suppliers as customarily sell within the territory of the local, and this
was done accordingly.

This resolution was either drafted by
Singer or submitted to him for approval, * * *

The evidence established that this
resolution was acted upon in many instances and non-members of the Amalgamated
Builders’ Council at Windsor found great difficulty in procuring supplies and
were greatly embarrassed in their business operations.

From time to time manufacturers and
wholesalers of plumbing and heating supplies were furnished with lists of
members of the local Section 112 of the Amalgamated Builders’ Council and
there was a tacit, if not an express agreement, that the dealers would refuse
to sell to non-members and this was actually done in many instances.

* *
*

In order to finance those organizations, a
levy was made upon the members * * * If default was made by
a member in payment of his assessment, he was liable to expulsion by the
Commissioner, Singer, and this power was exercised in several instances. The
resulting effect was that the expelled member was precluded from obtaining
labour or supplies wherewith to carry on his operations.

These various activities built up an autocratic
and despotic organization of the plumbing and heating industry in Windsor, * *
*

That the learned judge had in mind the nature of
the indictment to which the accused were called upon to answer is evidenced in
the following reference. He says:

Section 32 of the Combines
Investigation Act, (R.S.C., 1927, c. 26) declared it to be an indictable
offence on the part of anyone who is a party or privy to or knowingly assists
in the formation or operation of a combine within the meaning of the Act.

[Page 290]

He concludes by saying:

I have no hesitation in holding that the
evidence in this case established that there was a combine.

* *
*

The deductions I have already drawn from
the evidence clearly establish that the combine in this case falls within the
class indicated in this subsection (s. 2 (1)).

* *
*

To come within the Statute, the combine
must also be a merger, trust or monopoly so‑called, or (a) result
from any actual or tacit contract, agreement, arrangement or combination which
has or is designed to have the effect of any of the results set forth in
subsections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of sec. 2.

* *
*

The
indictment * * * alleges that the combine resulted from an
actual or tacit contract, agreement, arrangement or combination which has or is
designed to have the effects set forth in subs. 1, 3, 4 and 5 of s. 2.

The evidence in my view, as already
indicated, clearly establishes that there was an actual or tacit agreement,
arrangement or combination, but it is still open for decision as to the actual
or designed effect of such combine.

In my opinion the evidence establishes, and
I so find, that the combine did have or was designed to have the following
effects:

(a) limiting facilities for
supplying or dealing in plumbing and heating supplies within the purview of ss.
1.

(b) fixing a common price
within the meaning of ss. 2.

(c) enhancing the price or cost of
articles within the meaning of ss. 4. 

(d) preventing or lessening
competition or substantially controlling within the City of Windsor and
adjoining district the purchase, sale or supply of plumbing and heating
materials.

Summarizing these findings, the result is
that I hold the combine disclosed in the evidence falls within the class of
combines prohibited by s. 2 of this Act.

The learned judge then proceeds to deal with the
Trade Unions Act  and makes the following comment (with which we fully
agree):

It would be a travesty on justice if acts
and transactions such as those disclosed in the evidence in this case could be
justified or excused merely because the offenders were members of a Trade
Union.

Taking up the conspiracy charges (counts nos. 5,
6 and 7) under clauses (a), (b) and (d) of
subs. 1 of s. 498 , the learned judge proceeds:

The evidence applies to these charges as
well as to those already reviewed, and the findings of fact will also apply to
these counts.

The evidence establishes a conspiracy to
unduly limit the facilities for supplying and dealing in plumbing and heating
supplies.

I need only refer to the evidence as to the
arrangement restricting the sale or supply of materials to members of the
organization in question, which clearly establishes an offence under this
section.

[Page 291]

The evidence also establishes a conspiracy
to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the sale or supply of plumbing and
heating materials within the meaning of ss. (d) of s. 498 .

I find upon the evidence that there was a
conspiracy to restrain or injure trade or commerce as defined in ss. (b).

* *
*

It is strenuously argued that the
provisions of s. 497 apply to the situation in this case.

It was contended by counsel for the Crown,
and I think properly, that the provisions of s. 497 relate only to offences
charged under clause (b) of s. 498 (1).

* *
*

It is quite evident that it was never
intended by Parliament that s. 497 should operate as a complete defence to all
the offences created by s. 498 of the Code.

* *
*

Having arrived at the conclusion that
offences were committed against both the Combines Investigation Act and the
Criminal Code , it now becomes necessary to decide as to the complicity or
participation of the accused in the offences established.

After disposing of the cases of Singer, Paddon
and Ward, whom he found guilty on all the counts in the indictment, the learned
judge proceeds to discuss the cases of the other accused who were before him.
He says:

The case of the accused O’Connor rests upon
a different basis. He was retained by Singer as his counsel and from time to
time advised the latter in reference to Guild matters. He gave two written
opinions * * *

* * * He also addressed a meeting of the
Canadian Plumbing and Heating Guild at its annual convention at Toronto on
January 25th, 1928, in which he made an attack upon The Combines Investigation
Act and also on section 498  of The Criminal Code  but did not directly
advise evasion or disregard of the provisions of these Acts. In that address he
stated, among other things, that the Commissioner Singer had explained to him
his conception of the Guild and further stated he had an intimate connection
with the Commissioner and had been since the birth of the Guild in daily
contact with its affairs. He further stated that as the result of close
scrutiny of the charter documents and actions of the Guild since incorporation,
it was a lawful association, lawfully organized, lawfully conducted and that
every action thereof up to that time could be shouted from the housetops
without fear.

In conjunction with Singer he also appeared
before the Department at Ottawa and presented a draft document known as the
Canadian Cartels. In that document it was stated that Singer and O’Connor in
the beginning conceived and elaborated the idea which Amalgamated Builders’
Council exemplified.

For these statements and declarations by
O’Connor the Crown seek to hold him liable as a party or privy to or knowingly
assisting in the formation or operation of these combines.

I am of the opinion, however, and so hold,
that where the formation of an organization is for professedly legitimate
objects but the organization or its members afterwards participate in unlawful
operations, the party to the original formation is not criminally liable unless
and until

[Page 292]

he participates either as party or privy to
or knowingly assists in the illegal operations of the organization and I cannot
find on the evidence here any participation by O’Connor in the illegal
operations of these organizations or of the members of same.

In arriving at this conclusion I have in
mind the provisions of s. 69  of the Criminal Code , but, notwithstanding that
section, I cannot find upon the evidence that there was any participation or
complicity by O’Connor in the offences established in evidence and therefore a
verdict of not guilty must be found in this case.

The provision of s. 70, Cr. C., is also
of value in this connection.

These findings are relevant only because they
are incorporated by the learned trial judge in the part of his judgment dealing
with the present appellants.

The report of the Guild Convention held on the
25th and 26th of January, 1928, was sent out by Belyea. It contained the
following significant passage:

ACTING COMMISSIONER: During your
Commissioner’s enforced absence through sickness, your President will, at the
Commissioner’s request, act in his stead under the guidance and direction of
Mr. W.F. O’Connor, K.C.

In the course of dealing with the case against
the defendant W.F. O’Connor, the learned judge refers to “an
organization * * * for professedly legitimate
objects,” thereby implying that the actual objects of the organization, as
established by the evidence, were not legitimate.

The learned judge then proceeds to deal with the
cases of Belyea and Weinraub. It is true he goes on to speak of subsequent
unlawful operations, to which it was necessary, in his opinion, to show that
the appellants were either parties or privies, or that they knowingly assisted
therein. At the very outset he makes the momentous finding that

Undoubtedly these men took an active part
in the formation of the organization under review.

This very important finding may have escaped the
attention of counsel because it occurs in the body of a paragraph dealing with
other matters. Its significance, however, is too marked to permit of its being
overlooked by us. It stands unchallenged and unmet. Presumably on the ground
that the purpose of the organization was “professedly” (i.e., ostensibly)
lawful, and that there is not sufficient evidence that the appellants
participated in, or were privy to, the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of
the Windsor group, the learned judge acquitted them.

[Page 293]

Counsel for the appellants, in his memorandum of
argument, which is really a long factum of seventy-six pages, has seen fit to
divide his argument under some nine heads. I have read the “factum” through
and find it unnecessary to follow him in that division. In his supplementary
factum (consisting of one hundred closely typewritten pages) counsel proceeds
to discuss at inordinate length, though, no doubt, skilfully from his point of
view, all the evidence, oral and documentary, in the record. He deals lengthily
with many matters quite immaterial, his point of view apparently being that it
would aid his clients if he could succeed in showing their innocence regarding
matters not really vital to the charge against them; whereas, if the facts
found by Wright, J., were true, and the evidence supports such findings, and
those findings fairly lead to the conclusion of the guilt of the appellants,
all the rest must indeed be immaterial.

In respect to the only finding of fact by
Wright, J., in regard to which anything approaching error was shown to have
been made by that learned judge, in his supplementary factum counsel for
appellants apparently demonstrates that Wright, J., was wrong in holding that,
after the institution of the Zone System, all the meetings of “the Windsor
Group” were presided over by the Zone chairman.

But it will be noted that, in setting out the
material findings of the trial judge above, no allusion has been made to this
particular finding. That was because we regarded it as quite immaterial and
beside the question. Of course, much is made by counsel for the appellants of
this alleged error, but it cannot affect the issue before us, and we allude to
it merely to show that the matter has not been overlooked.

Neither do we accede to the argument of counsel
for the appellants that, if there be evidence that the accused were not
implicated in some particular matters in which Singer or others were involved,
that fact would afford an answer to the opinion of the Appellate Division that
the findings of the learned judge, and facts admitted by the appellants
themselves, sustain the holding

that these respondents (Belyea and
Weinraub) took an active part in the original scheme,—the conspiracy which
formed the basis for the prosecution,—is admitted;

[Page 294]

That view was not seriously controverted at bar,
counsel insisting rather that there was no evidence of actual complicity of the
appellants in, or of their privity to, the admittedly illegal acts done by the
Windsor group, alleged by the Crown to be merely illustrative of the ways and
means adopted—if not directed by the head office (in Toronto) of Singer and the
two appellants—to carry out the objects of the organization, which they
controlled and over which they presided. On the contrary, if there be evidence
to warrant convictions of the appellants for breach of the Combines
Investigation Act by actual participation in the formation of a combine
within the meaning of that statute, and evidence to justify convictions for
conspiracy under s. 498  of the Criminal Code —and we think there was
abundant evidence to support the convictions for both offences—we cannot
understand the materiality to the validity of the convictions of evidence
bearing upon such other matters.

Moreover, we think the Appellate Division was
entirely right in its conclusion that the trial judge had misdirected himself
when, although it was his opinion that both Belyea and Weinraub had
“undoubtedly * * * (taken) an active part in the formation
of the organization,” he held that, because there was not sufficient evidence
to warrant his finding that they had also actually taken part in the Windsor
operations, or were parties or privies thereto, they were not implicated in the
conspiracy charged, or in the formation of the illegal combine. We are in
accord with the view of the Appellate Division expressed in these words:

That these respondents took an active part
in the original scheme,—the conspiracy which formed the basis for the
prosecution,—is admitted; the error in law into which the learned judge fell
was in not distinguishing between the conspiracy itself and overt acts which,
while not themselves the conspiracy, were evidence of the existence of the
conspiracy. Because these respondents were not proved to have taken part in
these subsequent overt acts, the learned judge acquitted them, saying of one of
the respondents, “There is no evidence that connects him with any of the
illegal operations.”

We are of opinion that the appeal of the
Crown must succeed. Belyea and Weinraub were most active in carrying out the
projects of the conspiracy; were originally united with Singer himself in the
conspiracy of which the latter was found guilty. They should have been
convicted as were Singer, Paddon and Ward. Their part in the illegal acts was
much greater than that of Paddon and Ward, but less than that of Singer.

[Page 295]

If sitting as a jury, we should have no
hesitation in finding that the illegal acts done at Windsor were a result
intended by the defendants and their fellow conspirators when they formed the
organizations found to have been a combine and a conspiracy. But we do not
proceed on this ground, since to do so would involve making a finding of fact
contrary to a finding of the trial judge.

Counsel for the appellants argued at
considerable length that the Appellate Division had exceeded its jurisdiction
in this case because it reversed the trial judge on what counsel called a
finding of fact, i.e., the innocence of the accused of participation in the
formation of an illegal combine and of conspiracy within s. 498 , Cr. C. This,
it seems to us, involves a clear misconception of the true question in issue.

Having determined that the formation of the
various organizations in question amounted to the formation of an illegal combine,
and to a conspiracy within s. 498 , Cr. C., the learned judge proceeded
to deal with the questions as to who had incurred criminal responsibility. He
convicted Singer, Paddon and Ward on evidence which, in our opinion, clearly
implicated Belyea and Weinraub, in much the same manner in which Singer and his
companions were involved, in the formation of the combine and conspiracy in
question. He fell into error, however, when he proceeded to find that it was
essential to a finding of guilt of the accused, that they should be held to
have had actual knowledge of, or to have actually participated in, the overt
acts at Windsor.

Mr. O’Connor, somewhat ingeniously, argued
that, where there is an “inferred conspiracy,” or an “inferred combine,” as he
termed them, proof of the existence of which depends largely on certain overt
acts, it is necessary to show privity of the accused to, or participation by
them in, such overt acts, in order to make them liable for the formation of the
combine or the conspiracy. This seems to us to be a fallacy. The moment it is
established that a combine or conspiracy existed, it is unnecessary, in order
to warrant a conviction of the appellants for the formation of the combine, or
of the agreement to conspire, to show their complicity in subsequent illegal
acts done by, or with the connivance of, the body against members of which
conspiracy or unlawful combine is charged: provided, always, of course,

[Page 296]

that there is, in the evidence, sufficient proof
of the complicity of the accused in the original formation of the combine, or
in the agreement charged as conspiracy. Here, the learned trial judge
apparently had already found facts from which the conclusion was inevitable
that there was participation on the part of Belyea and Weinraub in the
formation of the illegal combine and the conspiracy, the existence of which he
had already found to be proven. On these findings, coupled with the admissions
made by Belyea and Weinraub in their testimony, and the documents of which they
were proved to have had knowledge, their convictions, as was held by the
Appellate Division, were a necessary consequence.

Although counsel for the appellants devotes one
entire part of his Memorandum of Points, viz., Part 4, to alleged “Errors of
Fact on the Trial,” i.e., errors of fact to be found in the judgment of the
learned trial judge, speaking of the trial judge, he, himself, makes this
formal admission, in the Memorandum, “His fact-finding was sound.” His clients
certainly cannot complain if they be held to this admission, especially so
since it appeals to us as being, with the one exception above adverted to,
entirely correct.

Upon the material facts found by the learned
trial judge, we think that manifestly his conclusion, resulting in the acquittal
of the appellants, was erroneous, and that such error was the direct result of
a misdirection in law.

The right of appeal by the Attorney-General,
conferred by s. 1013 (4) , Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of
the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to “questions of law.”
That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him
in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of
fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the
Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as
is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the
legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the
case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot
regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially where, as here, it
is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.

[Page 297]

Finally,—a point not raised by counsel for the
appellants during his two-and-a-half-day argument, or in his Memorandum of
Points, or supplementary factum, but which would seem to call for some notice
from us, is this.—By s. 1014 of the Criminal Code , the powers of the
Court of Appeal, on hearing a criminal appeal by a person convicted, are
defined. These powers, under subs. 3 are, in the event of the appeal being
allowed, to

(a) quash the conviction and
direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case (it) may make such other
order as justice requires.

This section is made applicable on any
appeal by the Attorney-General against an acquittal by the provision of s. 28,
c. 11, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, that mutatis mutandis, on the
appeal thereby given, the court shall have the same powers as it has on an
appeal by the accused. It does seem rather a strong thing to hold that the
effect of the words “mutatis mutandis” is that clause (a) must be
made to read, on an appeal (by the Attorney-General) being allowed, to

(a) quash the acquittal and direct
a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered;

yet that, apparently, was the construction put
upon this provision by the Appellate Division.

It occurred to some members of this Court that,
under such circumstances as are here present, the correct course would be to
apply clause (b) and to direct a new trial. That idea, however, would
seem to involve a lurking suspicion that we are, in fact, reversing the trial
judge on a question of fact, whereas, in reality, we do nothing of the kind,
but, on the contrary, we affirm the facts found by him, and, upon them, we
reach the conclusion that the only course open to the Appellate Division was to
allow the appeal and convict the present appellants, giving to the words “mutatis
mutandis” the effect given them by the Appellate Division, which we
certainly are not convinced was wrong.

For these reasons, we are of the opinion that
the appeals fail and must be dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Disqualification
of a petit juror—Juror convicted of criminal offence—No objection taken at the
trial—Insufficient ground of appeal—Applicability of s. 1011 Cr. C.—Leave to
appeal to this court granted by a judge under s. 1025 Cr. C.—Jurisdiction of
this court—Existence of conflict must also be found by the court at the hearing
of the appeal—Sections 1025, 1011, 1011 Cr. C.—The Jury Act R.S.B.C., 1924, c.
123, ss. 6, 10, 15.

The conviction of the respondent
was set aside by the appellate court on the ground that one of the jurors at
the trial was disqualified to act as such for the reason that he had been
convicted of an indictable offence within the meaning of section 6c of the Jury
Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 123).

Held that the fact of a defect of that kind in the
constitution of the petit jury constituted no ground for an appeal to the
appellate court in view of the provisions of section 1011 Cr. C, the more so as
no objection to it had been taken at the trial.

[Page 613]

Held, also, that the order of a judge of this court
granting leave to appeal under the provisions of section 1025 Cr. C. is not
conclusive as to the existence of conflict between the judgment to be appealed
from and that of some "" other court of appeal in a like case ""; and,
upon the hearing of the appeal, the Court must itself be independently
satisfied that there is, in fact, such a conflict. Duff J. expressed no
opinion.

Judgment of the Court of
Appeal ([1932] 1 W.W.R. 912) reversed.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the conviction of the respondent.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the
appellant.

Michael Garber for the
respondent.

The judgments of Anglin C.J.C.
and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. were rendered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The Crown appeals
by leave of Smith J. given under section 1025  of the Criminal Code . That section
reads :

1025. Either the Attorney-General
of the province or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting
aside or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence, if the judgment
appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a
like case, and if leave to appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced,
or within such extended time thereafter as the judge to whom the application is
made may for special reasons allow.

Although at first disposed to
think that the order of Smith J. might be conclusive as to the existence of
conflict between the judgment a quo and that of some "" other court
of appeal in a like cause,"" on consideration of the above quoted section
of the Code, I find that there really are two conditions precedent to the right
of appeal here, viz., (a) that there is, in fact, conflict between the
judgment a quo and the judgment of a court of appeal in a like case,
and, (b) that leave to appeal be granted by a judge of this court. The
latter condition was, undoubtedly, complied with; but the Court must be
independently satisfied of the existence of the former.

[Page 614]

The case cited by Smith J., (Rex
v. Boak[2]
), is probably distinguishable from that at bar, in so far as it relates to
disqualification of a petit juror, inasmuch as in that case, as was pointed out
in the judgment of this Court, the fact of such disqualification was known to
the prisoner and his counsel during the trial. Indeed, it would seem from the
judgment delivered that the juror's deafness had been canvassed before the
trial judge; yet no objection on that ground was taken to the trial proceeding.
But there does seem to be a clear conflict between the decision a quo
and the decision of the Court of King's Bench for Quebec in Rex
v. Battista[3].
Other cases could, no doubt, be found in which there were decisions along
similar lines to that given in Rex v. Battista[4]
. For instance, see Brisebois v. Reginam[5]
; whereas Rex v. McCrae[6]
may be cited in support of the view taken by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, although, in that case, differing from the Boak case[7]
, the presence of a disqualified juror had been complained of before verdict
was rendered. See too R. v. Feore[8]
.

In the result, it would seem that
the conflict between the decisions in the Battista case (2) and in that
at bar justified the granting of leave to appeal, and that, consequently, there
is jurisdiction here to entertain this appeal.

The present appeal is from an
order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the conviction
of the respondent Stewart on the ground that one of the jurors at the trial was
disqualified by reason of clause (c)of section 6 of The Jury Act
(R.S.B.C, c. 123), which provides that,

6. Every person coming
within any of the classes following shall be absolutely disqualified for
service as a juror, that is to say:—

(c) Persons convicted
of indictable offences, unless they have obtained a free pardon.

It is common ground that the case
falls within this clause. The only question would seem to be whether or not the
fact of a defect of this kind in the constitution of the petit jury, afforded
ground for an appeal to the Court of Appeal in view of the provisions of
section 1011 Cr. C., no objection to it having been taken at the trial.

[Page 615]

There is nothing before us to
shew that both counsel for the prisoner and the prisoner himself, were ignorant
of this disqualification in question during the trial (Rex v. Boak[9]
) ; but that this was the case may be assumed since the Crown does not rely on
this objection to the appeal, counsel representing the Crown conceding indeed,
as he did at bar, that both the prisoner and his counsel at the trial were
unaware of the fact of this disqualification.

I see no reason why the
provisions of section 1011  of the Criminal Code  should not apply to this case.
That section reads as follows:

1011. No omission to observe
the directions contained in any Act as respects the qualification, selection,
balloting or distribution of jurors, the preparation of the jurors' book, the
selecting of jury lists or the striking of special juries shall be ground for impeaching
any verdict, or shall be allowed for error upon any appeal to be brought upon
any judgment rendered in any criminal case.

There can be no doubt that this
section is intended to apply to the case of a petit juror since it deals with a
"" ground for impeaching any verdict"" and "" error upon any appeal
to be brought upon a judgment rendered in any criminal case."" The effect
of s. 1011  is, after verdict, to preclude an appeal on the ground, inter
alia, of disqualification of a petit juror, no complaint thereof having
been made at the trial. That section, in our opinion, is applicable and was
conclusive against the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case at
bar.

Moreover, section 1010 Cr. C.
provides that,

1010. Judgment, after
verdict upon an indictment for any offence against this Act, shall not be
stayed or reversed,

(d) because
any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the
sheriff or other officer.

If the fact, that a person who
sat to try a case had no right to be in the jury box because not returned as a
juror, cannot be taken advantage of, after verdict, as a ground of appeal, a
fortiori, we think that a disqualification of a person on the list who
serves as a petit juror, taken for the first time only after verdict, must
likewise be insufficient to warrant an appeal. We entirely agree with the
decision in Rex v. Battista[10]
.

The case of Bureau v. Regem
(the latest authority to which we are referred)[11]
is entirely distinguishable from

[Page 616]

that at bar on two grounds, viz.,
(a) that case had to do with a grand jury and not a petit jury, and (b)
the appellant there would appear to have made every effort possible during the
trial to have effect given to his objection.

Apart altogether from any ground
of appeal based on s. 1010 (d), as above stated, s. 1011  of the
Criminal Code  is conclusive against the appeal to the Court of Appeal in this
case. The appeal to this Court will, accordingly, be allowed and the judgment
of the trial court restored.

DUFF J.—This appeal involves the
construction and application of section 1011  of the Criminal Code , which reads
as follows:

No omission to observe the
directions contained in any Act as respects the disqualification, selection,
balloting or distribution of jurors, the preparation of the jurors' book, the
selecting of jury lists or the striking of special juries, shall be a ground
for impeaching any verdict, or shall be allowed for error upon any appeal to be
brought upon any judgment rendered in any criminal case.

The relevant B.C. enactments
(R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 123, secs. 10, 15 and 6) are, in substance, these:

Section 10 of the Act directs the
selector to select, from the last revised voters' list for the county, the
requisite number of persons resident in the county, to serve as grand and petit
jurors for the next succeeding year.

Section 15 directs the selectors
to meet and hold meetings annually commencing on the first Monday in July for
the purpose of selecting a preliminary list of persons liable to serve
as jurors.

Section 6 enumerates certain
classes of persons, who, although their names appear on the last revised list
of voters, are disqualified from service as a juror, inter alia, (c)

*** persons convicted of
indictable offences, unless they have obtained a free pardon ***.

One of the jurymen who tried the
respondent was afterwards discovered to be a person who had been convicted of
an indictable offence, within the meaning of section 6. On this ground, that is
to say, on the ground that this juryman was disqualified to act as such, the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia quashed the conviction.

The question before us is whether
or not this decision can be sustained, in view of the terms of section 1011 ,
above quoted. In my opinion the gist of the complaint upon 

[Page 617]

which the respondent's objection
is founded is of such a character as to bring the objection within the language
of section 1011 . The complaint is founded on the failure of the selectors to
observe the directions of the Jury Act, who are authorized and required
to select, for the jury lists, persons liable to be called upon to serve as
jurors. The Act plainly excludes from the classes of persons which it was
competent to the selectors to select, persons who have been guilty of an
indictable offence, and who have not received free pardon therefor. It is to
this default that must be ascribed the fact that the disqualified juryman was
called to serve and did serve as one of the jury on the trial of the accused.
No wrong against the respondent is alleged in respect of the trial, except the
fact that the juryman, being disqualified for the reasons mentioned, was
present on the jury. I should have thought, especially having regard to the
observations of Channel, J. in Montreal Street Ry. Co. v. Normandin
(1), delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
that in the absence of some such provision as section 1011 , the presence of
this disqualified juryman would have been sufficient ground for quashing the
conviction. But in my opinion, that particular illegality is one of the class
contemplated by that section, and, therefore, the objection is not open to the
respondent.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Accused’s
drunkenness as defence-Degree of incapacity—Murder or manslaughter—Directions
to jury-New trial.

The accused appealed from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (55 Can. Crim. Cas. 51) affirming
(by majority) his conviction

[Page 331]

for murder. It had been contended in his
defence that at the time of his act his condition from drink was such that the
act could not be murder; and he alleged misdirection by the trial judge to the
jury on this question, which involved the law as to what state of incapacity
resulting from drink will reduce a crime from murder to manslaughter.

Held: In the
circumstances of the case, an essential question for the jury was: Given the
existence of some degree of capacity in the accused, and assuming the facts
deposed to by Crown witnesses (if credited) in describing the accused’s act in
striking the fatal blow and his conduct and expressions before and after that
act, whether or not he was so affected by drink as to be incapable of having
the intent to kill or of having the intent (in reckless disregard of the
consequences) to cause some bodily injury, “known” to him to be “likely to
cause death” (Cr. Code, s. 259 (a) (b)). That question was one upon
which the jury must pass in order to enable them to determine the existence or
non-existence of the intent in fact. (Beard’s case, [1920] A.C. 479, at
501-502, referred to). And as the trial judge, while properly directing the
jury’s attention to the defence as put forward by accused’s counsel (that
accused was in such a state that his mind was not functioning, that his “mind
was gone,” that he was incapable of a degree of “thought” enabling him to be
aware of the nature of his physical acts), did not direct them to the question
above defined, there should be a new trial.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1],
sitting as a Court of Appeal under the provisions of the Criminal Code , which
affirmed (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) his conviction, at trial before
Chisholm J. and a jury, on an indictment for murder. A defence of the accused
was that his condition of drunkenness, at the time of the commission of the
offence, was such that he should not be convicted of the crime. of murder; and
his main ground of appeal to this Court was that there was misdirection by the
trial judge in his instructions to the jury in this regard; the question
involving the law as to what state of incapacity resulting from drink will
reduce a crime from murder to manslaughter.

D. A. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.

F. F. Mathers K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Duff J.—We have come to the conclusion that there must be a new trial, and
the discussion of the facts will, therefore, be limited to what is strictly
unavoidable in the elucidation of the points of law involved.

[Page 332]

Culpable homicide (by
stabbing) was not, at any stage of the proceedings, disputed. The defence
rested upon the alleged condition of the appellant resulting from drink, and
the real issue was whether or not his condition, at the time of the commission
of the offence, was such as to bring the offence within the legal category of
manslaughter. The defence appears from the learned judge’s charge to have been
thus presented to the jury. The accused, counsel seems to have urged, was in
such a state that his mind was not functioning, that his “mind was gone,” that
he was incapable of a degree of “thought” enabling him to be aware of the
nature of his physical acts. The learned trial judge told the jury that, this
view of the prisoner’s condition could not be accepted unless they were
satisfied that the witnesses for the Crown, who had described the prisoner’s
act in striking the fatal blow, and had given an account of his conduct and
reported the expressions used by him before and after that act, were not worthy
of credit.

This, we have no doubt, was a proper direction:
but the appeal turns upon other considerations. The rules of law for
determining the validity of a defence such as that put forward by the accused,
are stated in two propositions in the judgment of Lord Birkenhead in Beard’s
case (1). These propositions, with which the other six Lords agreed, are as
follows:

2. That evidence of drunkenness which
renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to
constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts
proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

3. That evidence of drunkenness falling
short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

These propositions embody the rules governing us
on this appeal; but, before considering the application of them to the facts,
it is desirable to advert to the provisions of the Criminal Code  upon
the subjects of murder and manslaughter. The Code (sections 250 and 252),
begins by defining homicide. Homicide, it is declared, falls into two classes,
culpable and not culpable, of which the last mentioned, CD Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, at 501-502.

[Page 333]

homicide which is not culpable, is not an
offence. Culpable homicide (which includes murder and manslaughter) is then
defined; and is declared to be murder in the cases enumerated in sections 259
and 260. Section 261 formulates the conditions in which murder may, by
“provocation,” be reduced to manslaughter, and finally by section 262, it is
declared that culpable homicide not amounting to murder is manslaughter. Cases
of culpable homicide as defined by sections 259 and 260 constitute murder
unless the provisions of section 261, dealing with the effect of provocation,
come into play, or the person charged is, on some special ground, protected
from criminal responsibility; other cases of culpable homicide, unless the
offender is within some such protection, constitute manslaughter.

We are not concerned with section 260 or with
the 3rd or 4th subsection of section 259. The definitions now pertinent are
those found in subsections (a) and (b) of section 259, which are
in these words:

259. Culpable homicide is murder,

(a) if the offender means to cause
the death of the person killed;

(b) if the offender means to cause
to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be
likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

Subsection (b) comes into operation where
the offender means to cause bodily harm which he knows to be likely to cause
death, and when he is in the state of mind described by the words “reckless
whether death ensues or not.” In the circumstances of this case, the question
of substance for the jury was whether the appellant was capable of having the
intent to kill or of having the intent (in reckless disregard of the
consequences) to cause some bodily injury, “known” to him to be “likely to
cause death.”

Section 259 seems to narrow somewhat the common
law definition of murder. In the judgment quoted above[2] (at pages 503 and 504), Lord Birkenhead,
referring to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Meade’s case[3], uses these words:

Your Lordships have had the advantage of a
much more elaborate examination of the authorities upon which the rule is
founded than was placed before the Court of Criminal Appeal, and I apprehend
can have

[Page 334]

no doubt that the proposition in Meade’s
case (1) in its wider interpretation is not, and cannot be, supported by
authority. The difficulty has arisen largely because the Court of Criminal
Appeal used language which has been construed as suggesting that the test of the
condition of mind of the prisoner is not whether he was incapable of forming
the intent but whether he was incapable of foreseeing or measurin the
consequences of the act. In this respect the so-called rule differs from the
direction of Lord Coleridge J., which is more strictly in accordance with the
earlier authorities.

The intent necessary to bring a given offence
under the definition in subsection (b) involves a knowledge by the
offender of the “likely” consequences of his act; and a direction to the jury
that, in examining a defence based upon incapacity alleged to have been
produced by drunkenness, they should not consider the capacity of the accused
to “foresee or measure the consequences of his act” would hardly be a direction
in conformity with the criteria formulated in section 259. The right direction
in cases involving the application of subsection (b) is that evidence of
drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of the state of mind defined by
that subsection may be taken into account with the other facts of the case for
the purpose of determining whether or not, in fact, the accused had the intent
necessary to bring the case within that subsection; but that the existence of
drunkenness not involving such incapacity is not a defence.

The learned trial judge instructed the jury that
to justify a conviction for murder they must find that the accused was animated
by the intent to kill. This was, technically, a little too favourable to the
prisoner; although it is probable that such a departure from strict technical
precision would seldom have any effect on the result of a trial. In this case,
the learned judge no doubt considered that the jury was not likely to dwell
upon the distinction between meaning to kill, and meaning to inflict injury known
to be likely to cause death, and in reckless disregard of the consequences.

The issue as to capacity is an issue of fact and
is primarily for the jury. There may be cases in which, the defence of want of
capacity resulting from drunkenness

[Page 335]

having been put forward, the trial judge would
be justified in directing the jury that there was no evidence of that degree of
incapacity which alone could properly be considered by them in passing upon the
existence of intent in fact. This, however, we think, is not one of those
cases. The jury evidently negatived the “absolute incapacity,” the existence of
which the learned judge asked them to consider, and which he exemplified by the
illustration of a drunken mother destroying the life of her infant child by
rolling over upon it in bed; but there still remained the question—given the
existence of some degree of capacity, and assuming the facts deposed to by the
witnesses for the Crown, whether the appellant was so affected by drink as to
be incapable of having the intent to kill or of meaning to cause an injury
which he knew was likely to result in death. This issue, as already observed,
was primarily for the jury; and it was an issue upon which they must pass in
order to enable them to determine the existence or non-existence of the intent
in fact.

The able and experienced judge who presided at
the trial properly directed the attention of the jury to the defence as it was
put before them by counsel for the prisoner; and, having done this, he did not
ask them to apply their minds to the further issue we have just defined. It was
the prisoner’s right, however, notwithstanding the course of his counsel at the
trial, to have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case. We think,
therefore, that there must be a new trial.

Appeal allowed, and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Keeping common gaming
house—Automatic vending machine—Cr. Code, ss. 226, 229, 986 (2), 986 (4) (as
amended, 1930, c. 11, s. 27).

Accused had on his premises an automatic
vending machine in which customers placed a five cent coin, pulled a lever, and
received from the machine a package of candy, with or without “slugs” (varying
in number) which had no commercial or exchangeable value but might be used to
operate the machine to shew printed legends for amusement only (no candy being
emitted). The candy package emitted for the coin deposited was such as that
sold over the counter for five cents, and on the sale of the candy emitted the
accused made a profit.

Held (reversing
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba): Accused was not guilty, under the Criminal Code , of
keeping a common gaming house. Cr. Code, ss. 226, 229, 986 (2), 986 (4)
(as amended, 1930, c. 11, s. 27 ), considered. Rex v. Freedman, 39
Man. R. 407 , overruled. Rex v.
Wilkes, 66 Ont. L.R. 319, approved.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba, affirming
the conviction of the appellant by

[Page 418]

R. B. Graham, Esquire, Police Magistrate, at
Winnipeg, Manitoba, “for that he the said [appellant] at the city of Winnipeg
aforesaid on or about the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, did unlawfully keep a
disorderly house, to wit, a common gaming house at 605 Corydon Avenue in the
City of Winnipeg, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and
provided.”

The following statement of facts had been
agreed on by the informant and the accused:

“1. That on the 21st day of April, A.D. 1931,
an Information and Complaint was laid by the Informant before Fred E. Law, one
of His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the Province of Manitoba, charging
that the said accused at the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, did
on or about the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, unlawfully keep a disorderly
house, to wit, a common gaming house at 605 Corydon Avenue in the said City of
Winnipeg, contrary to the provisions of the Statutes in such case made and
provided.

“2. That on the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931,
a search warrant was properly and legally issued by R. B. Graham, Esquire, a
Police Magistrate in and for the Province of Manitoba under the powers conferred by Section 641  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

“3. That the said Warrant was duly executed
on the said 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, and on the said premises of the
accused was found in operation an automatic vending machine which is filed as
Exhibit 1 in this case and which customers were allowed and invited to use and
operate.

“4. The said machine may be operated by
placing a five cent coin or a slug which is a perforated metal disc in a slot
at the top of the machine and pulling down a lever attached to the side of the
said machine.

“5. On pulling down the lever, three discs
which can be seen through a glass covering in front, revolve and when they come
to a stop, display printed legends or sentences, such printing being on various
coloured squares on each of the three discs.

“6. That in every instance that a five cent
piece is deposited in the slot of the machine and the lever pulled the interior
mechanism of the machine is put in motion and a

[Page 419]

package of candy is emitted. The package of
candy so emitted is identical with the package of candy which the accused sells
over the counter for five cents. In operating the automatic vending machine
either with a coin or a slug the machine may or may not emit certain metal
discs or slugs varying in number from two to twenty depending upon what point
the revolving wheels may come to rest, which discs or slugs remain the property
of the accused. In some instances no slugs are emitted. These slugs or tokens
have no commercial or exchangeable value but may be used by the customer to
operate the machine and when it is so operated with a slug or token, it shows
across the cylinders of the machine a printed legend more or less humorous for
the amusement of the customer, but the use of the slug or token will not result
in the operator receiving any candy. No candy is emitted when slugs are used.

“7. That printed in the front of the machine
is a notice which reads as follows:

Candy Vendor

This machine is for the sole purpose of
vending candies and confections. Tokens received from this vendor are of no
cash or trade value but may be used to play this vendor for the customer’s
amusement only. No candies or confections vended for amusement tokens.

“8. That this machine, Exhibit 1, is owned by
the Accused who is the owner of the premises at 605
 Corydon Avenue, in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, and such premises are occupied by the Accused for the purpose of
carrying on the business of a confectioner.

“9. That on the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931,
an officer of the City of Winnipeg Police Force operated the said machine and deposited with each operation a five
cent coin in the slot of the machine, for which he received a package of candy
for every five cent piece deposited.

“10. That as a result of the said operation of
the said machine the Constable received in addition six slugs which had been
discharged from the said machine.

“11. That the said officer offered the said
slugs to the Accused in exchange for merchandise and that the said Accused
informed the officer that the said slugs had no trade or exchangeable value but
that they could only be used to operate the machine.”

[Page 420]

The note of the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba, upholding
the conviction, was as follows:

On the admissions filed and on the further
admission that there was profit to the Accused on the sale of the candy emitted
by the automatic Vending Machine, the Appeal is hereby dismissed.

The appellant, on application to a judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada, under the provisions of s. 1025 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

The sections of the Criminal Code  involved
were sections 226 , 229 , 986 (2)  and 986 (4)  (as amended by s. 27 of c. 11,
1930).

The Court of Appeal for Manitoba had previously given a decision in
Rex v. Freedman[1] which
it followed in the present case. A conflicting decision was the judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in Rex v. Wilkes[2], which was relied upon by the appellant in
the present case.

M. Marcus for the
appellant.

F. H. Chrysler K.C. for the respondent.

After hearing argument by counsel for the
appellant and for the respondent, and without calling on counsel for the
appellant in reply, the Court delivered judgment orally, allowing the appeal
and quashing the conviction, adopting the reasons for decision in Rex v.
Wilkes3, supra.

Appeal allowed; conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE

Criminal Law—Appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Cr., C., s. 1023—“Question of law”.

An appeal from the judgment of the Appellate
Division, Ont. (40 Ont. W.N. 129) affirming (two judges dissenting) the
appellant’s conviction, by Ross, Co. C.J., for stealing an automobile, was
dismissed, on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal, the
questions raised, and on which there was dissent in the Appellate Division, being
all questions of fact, in regard to which there was no right of appeal to this
Court under s. 1023, Cr. C.

Assuming that the question whether there was
any evidence to support a conviction should be deemed a question of law, yet
the question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge
from facts established in evidence, is not a question of law but one of fact.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1]
dismissing (Mulock, C.J.O., and Grant, J.A., dissenting) the appellant’s appeal
against his conviction, by Ross, Co. C.J., sitting in the County Court Judge’s
Criminal Court of the County of Elgin, of stealing an automobile (Criminal
Code , s. 377 ).

V.T. Foley for the appellant.

I.A. Humphries K.C. for the respondent.

On conclusion of the argument by counsel for the
appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of
the Court was orally delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The Court is unanimously of the
opinion that it has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.

On examination, it turns out that the questions
raised are all questions of fact,—questions of the appreciation of evidence
which were eminently for the trial judge, and in regard to which there is no
right of appeal to this Court under section 1023, Cr. C.

[Page 417]

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is much
wider than ours in these matters, but, the mere fact that a judge dissents in
that Court on matters of fact, on which it is entirely proper for him to do so,
does not mean that there is foundation for an appeal to this Court, where the
appeal is confined to matters of dissent in law below.

Assuming that the question, whether there was
any evidence to support a conviction, should be deemed a question of law, the
question whether the proper inference has been drawn by the trial judge from
facts established in evidence, is really not a question of law, but purely a
question of fact for his consideration.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Broker—Conversion—Theft—Witness—Accomplice—Charge —Misdirection—Proper
course by trial judge as to warning.

Conviction of appellant for conversion
affirmed, the court holding that the jury could not, on the evidence, have
reached another conclusion. Though finding misdirection in a material matter,
the majority of the court (Cannon J. contra) held that it did not
result in a miscarriage of justice or wrong to the accused. (Cr. C., s. 1014 (2).)

Per Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.—The
misdirection by the trial judge to the jury was that, although he warned the
jury properly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice, he further instructed them, in effect, that if they believed his
evidence, although not corroborated, it was their duty to convict the accused.
This was a departure by the trial judge from the direction given by this court
in Vigeant v. The King ([1930] Can. S.C.R. 396, at 399, 400) as to the proper course to be taken in
regard to warning of the danger of convicting without corroborative evidence.
The law as very carefully considered and laid down in that case should be
strictly followed by trial judges and any substantial departure from it must
always be attended with peril. The rule requiring warning applies equally
whether there be or be not in fact corroborative evidence of the testimony of
an accomplice.

The appellant was charged with having
received from his clients, in the course of his business as broker, various sums of money and other securities with
instructions to apply the same, in whole or in part, to the purchase of
securities upon stock exchanges and of fraudulently, in violation of good faith
and contrary to such direction, applying these sums of money and securities to
his own private use and the use of his firm. The main testimony against the
accused was given by a witness who, it was admitted, had been an accomplice.
The principal ground of appeal was that the trial judge failed to properly
instruct the jury as to the danger of accepting, without corroboration, the
testimony of an accomplice.

L. Gendron K.C. for
the appellant.

E. Bertrand K.C. for
the respondent.

At the conclusion of the argument, the judgment
of the majority of the court was orally delivered by

Anglin C.J.C—We do not think it necessary to reserve judgment in this case.
We have had abundant opportunity to look into it both during the exhaustive
argument here and before. While the majority of us arе
of the opinion that there was misdirection in a material
matter, in that the learned judge, although he warned the jury properly of the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, further
instructed them, in effect, that if they believed his evidence, although not
corroborated, it was their duty to convict (and we wish to compliment counsel for the accused on the ability he has
shewn in the presentation of the case in this regard), we are also satisfied
that the jury, properly directed, must have reached the same conclusion as that
actually reached in this case (Brooks v. The King[1]).

Moreover we are all satisfied that the jury
could not, on the evidence in the case, have failed to convict the accused. The
case, therefore, is one for the application of

[Page 623]

section 1014
(2)  of the Criminal Code , and the Court, being convinced that the
misdirection did not result im any
miscarriage of justice or wrong to the accused, is unanimously of the view that
the appeal fails and that the conviction must be affirmed. The appeal is,
therefore, dismissed.

We should add that we entirely disagree with the
view of Mr. Justice Hall that
the rule requiring warning does not apply where there is, in fact,
corroboration. The rule applies equally whether there be or be not
corroborative evidence of the testimony of an accomplice.

The departure by the learned trial judge in the
present case from the plain direction given by this court in Vigeant v. The
King[2], as to the proper course to be taken
in regard to warning of the danger of convicting without corroborative evidence
very nearly wrecked this conviction. The law as very carefully considered and
laid down in that case should be strictly followed by trial judges. Any
substantial departure from it must always be attended with peril.

Cannon J.—With respect, I cannot
agree that the learned trial judge, after warning the jury properly of the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, further
instructed them, in effect, that if they believed that evidence, although not
corroborated, it was their duty to convict, I
cannot read such instructions in the following words of the learned
judge:

Maintenant la complicité se présente dans
cette affaire. La défense a prévenu le tribunal de donner la direction aux
jurés que si les jurés en arrivent à la conclusion qu’il y a des témoins
complices en cette cause—évidemment
il ne peut s’agir que de Statz—il
est toujours dangereux de condamner un individu sur le témoignage de son
complice, surtout si ce témoignage n’est pas corroboré. Mais il est de mon
devoir de vous dire que, même s’il n’est pas corroboré, vous devez tout de même
prendre en considération le témoignage du complice, le peser et en tirer les
conclusions que vous croyez devoir tirer. Le témoignage du complice est reçu,
mais il a plus ou moins de force selon qu’il est plus ou moins corroboré.

I reach the conclusion that the two points raised by the dissenting
judgment of Mr. Justice Allard were badly taken, and I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal
law—Conspiracy—Witness—Accomplice—Charge—Misdirection— New trial—Police spy or
informer—Need of corroboration—Practice when dissenting opinion in appellate
court—Cr. C, s. 573, s.1013, ss. 5.

The appellant, with two other men, was
convicted of conspiring to commit an indictable offence. On appeal to the
appellate court and to this court, the appellant’s main ground was that one
Boulanger, the chief witness for the crown, was in fact an accomplice; that the
direction given by the trial judge was bad in law, as he had omitted to
instruct the jury on what is an accomplice in law, and to warn them of the
danger of convicting on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

[Page 397]

Held that, after
consideration of the charge as a whole and reading it in the light of the
evidence, there had been misdirection by the trial judge and that the appellant
was entitled to a new trial. There was in the record of the trial some evidence
upon which the jury might have found that Boulanger had been, at some stage of
the affair, an accomplice in the conspiracy charged against the three accused;
and it appears by his charge that the trial judge thought this was a question
of fact that should be submitted for the determination of the jury. Therefore
it was the first duty of the trial judge to have instructed the jury as to what
in law would constitute a man an accomplice, he should then have proceeded to
direct their attention particularly to any facts in evidence which would serve
to indicate Boulanger’s complicity in the conspiracy at any stage thereof, and
to submit to them the issue as to whether what he was proved to have done made
him, having regard to the direction in law already given, an accomplice; he
should then have instructed the jury that, if they concluded that the witness
was, at any stage of the proceedings, an accomplice in the crime charged
against the accused, there would be danger in convicting them of that crime
upon his evidence standing alone and uncorroborated, although the law did not
preclude their doing so.

The formal judgment of the appellate court
directed that “separate judgments should be pronounced” by the two dissenting
judges of the court; and there was no direction that any other judgment be
pronounced except that to be delivered by Cannon J., who was said to have been
“designated by the Chief Justice to pronounce judgment.” But opinions,
practically the same as that of Cannon J., were also delivered by the two
remaining judges.

Held that such
a practice is contrary to the imperative prohibition of ss. 5 of s. 1013 Cr. C,
its impropriety having already been asserted by this court in Davis v.
The King, [1924] Can.
S.C.R. 522. Gouin v. The King, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 539; De Bortoli v. The King, [1927] Can. S.C.R. 455, also ref.

Observations, in view of its regrettable
results, as to misdirection by a trial judge which necessitates a new trial,
especially where the misdirection is due to inattention to matters of
substance.

Comments made upon a passage of Phipson on
Evidence, 3rd Ed., at page 456, corrected in the 6th Ed., at page 486. The
statement that “the rule requiring the corroboration of accomplice does not
apply to * * * police spy” means that the informer must have been connected
with the matter from the first only as a police spy and not merely have
“continued” as such.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the
Court of King’s Bench, criminal side, and sustaining the conviction of the
appellant upon an indictment of having conspired to commit an indictable
offence.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.

[Page 398]

Francois Lajoie K.C. and Leopold
Pinsonnault for the appellant.

Valmore Bienvenue K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

J Anglin C.J.C.—The
appellant (Vigeant), with two other men, Edgar Gariépy and Armand Tremblay, was
convicted at the assizes at Three Rivers, Que., before the Honourable Mr.
Justice Marchand, of conspiring to commit an indictable offence (Cr. C., s. 573). On appeal to the Court of King’s
Bench (Appeal Side) by all three from this conviction, several grounds were
taken; but only the two following, as given in the judgment of Cannon J., were
thought to require consideration by the court:

(ƒ) Le témoignage de
Boulanger est dans l’espèce un témoignage de complice avant le fait, son
témoignage doit être considéré comme tel, et Boulanger seul incrimine Vigeant
dans l’offense reprochée, soit de la conspiration.

(g) La direction donnée par le
président du tribunal aux jurés est fausse en droit, alors que le juge n’a pas
mentionné ce fait, le juge a omis de renseigner les jurés sur ce qui peut être
un complice en droit et que c’est une question de fait que les jurés ont à
décider.

In the appellant’s factum in this court these
two grounds are treated as one and stated as follows:

The witness Boulanger was in fact an
accomplice and the direction given by the president of the assizes was bad in
law, and the learned judge having omitted to instruct the jury on what is an
accomplice in law, and to warn them of the danger to convict on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

This was the ground of dissent by Lafontaine
C.J.Q. and Létourneau, J. in the Court of King’s Bench.

The formal judgment of that court

directs that it is convenient that separate
judgments should be pronounced by Chief Justice Lafontaine and Mr. Justice Létourneau,
two of the members of the court who dissent from the judgment of the majority
for the reasons stated in their respective judgments.

There is no direction that any other judgment be
pronounced except that to be delivered by Mr. Justice Cannon, who is said to
have been

designated by the Chief Justice to
pronounce judgment.

Yet, notwithstanding the imperative prohibition
of s.s. 5 of s. 1013  of the Criminal Code  that

no judgment with respect to the
determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any other member
of the court,

save that which has been sa directed to be
pronounced, the record now before us contains opinions by two of the learned

[Page 399]

judges of the Court of King’s Bench, whose
views, speaking generally, coincide with those of Mr. Justice Cannon. We had
occasion to remark on the impropriety of a similar practice in Davis v.
The King[1]. See
also Gouin v. The King[2]; De Bortoli
v. The King[3].

After fully considering the record of the trial,
which occupied three days, we are of opinion that there was some evidence upon
which the jury might (of course we do not at all mean that they should) have
found that Boulanger, the chief witness for the Crown, had been, at some stage
of the affair, an accomplice in the conspiracy charged against the three defendants.
That the trial judge thought this was a question of fact that should be
submitted for the determination of the jury is manifest from the following
passage in his charge:

Vous aurez à juger la conduite de Boulanger.
Dès le premier ou deux d’août, il a averti le gérant de la banque, que Ton
tramait quelque chose contre lui. Dès le quatre août il a rencontré le
détective Jargaille, à tous les jours après ça, à chaque fois qu’il voit les
accusés, qu’il avait connaissance de ce qu’ils faisaient, il venait le dire au
détective Jargaille. Il était en communication constante avec lui. Je ne crois
pas que c’est la conduite d’un homme qui est complice dans la préparation d’un
crime. Je vous laisse à décider si la conduite de Boulanger, est la conduite de
quelqu’un qui avait préparé un complot.

It was suggested in the course of argument by
counsel for the Crown that the complicity on the part of Boulanger referred to
in the above passage was not complicity in the conspiracy charged against the
defendants but in some other crime, which, it was said, the evidence disclosed
was in the contemplation of Boulanger and the defendants. After careful
consideration of the charge as a whole and reading it in the light of the
evidence it seems to us impossible to put that construction upon the language
used; on the contrary, it seems clear that what the learned judge intended to
leave to the jury by this passage in his charge was the question of Boulanger’s
complicity in the very conspiracy which was the subject of investigation.

Under such circumstances, the first duty of the
trial judge was, in our opinion, to have instructed the jury as to what, in
law, would constitute a man an accomplice. He should then have proceeded to
direct their attention particularly

[Page 400]

to any facts in evidence which would serve to
indicate Boulanger’s complicity in the conspiracy at any stage thereof; and to
submit to them the issue as to whether what he was proved to have done made
him, having regard to the direction in law, already given, an accomplice.
Nothing of this kind appears to have been done by the learned trial judge in
this instance.

He should then proceed to instruct the jury
that, if they concluded that the witness was, at any stage of the proceedings,
an accomplice in the crime charged against the defendants, there would be
danger in convicting them of that crime upon his evidence standing alone and
uncorroborated; that the law does not preclude their doing so— indeed, they are
at liberty to do so—but that there is danger in basing a conviction on such
uncorroborated evidence. If, after this warning, the jury had faith enough in
the evidence given by the accomplice to convict, their verdict will not be set
aside. The jury should not be told to acquit the prisoner; but they should be
warned of the danger of convicting. Rex v. Royal[4]. Where there has been failure so to charge
a jury with regard to the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice the
conviction must be quashed. Gouin v. The King[5]; Brunet v. The King[6].

A passage from the 3rd edition of Phipson on
Evidence (1902), at p. 456, cited by Mr. Justice Cannon, which, at first blush,
lends colour to the view taken by that learned judge, that the rule as to
corroboration does not apply

to the case of persons who have * * *
continued in a conspiracy as agents of the police,

in our opinion does not correctly state the law.
Indeed, this misleading statement will be found to have been corrected in a
later edition of Mr. Phipson’s work, viz., the 6th edition of 1921, at p. 486,
where it is said that

the rule requiring the corroboration of
accomplices does not apply to * * * persons who have joined in or even provoked
the crime as police spies.

The latter passage makes it clear that the
informer must have been connected with the matter from the first only as a
police spy and not merely have “continued” as such. This distinction underlies
the observation made in Roscoe’s Criminal Evidence (15th Ed.) at p. 156. Here,
as already

[Page 401]

stated, there was some evidence on which it was
open to the jury to determine, if they were so advised, that, from the 22nd of
July and up to the 2nd or 4th of August, the witness Boulanger was connected
with the conspiracy charged against the defendants as a principal therein and
not merely as agent provocateur, police spy or informer.

On the whole case, for the foregoing reasons and
for those very clearly and succinctly stated by the learned Chief Justice of
Quebec in his dissenting judgment, we are of the opinion that the conviction of
the appellant Vigeant must be set aside and a new trial as against him ordered.

This conclusion is the more satisfactory,
because, while not open for consideration in this court, owing to its not
having been made a ground of dissent in the court below, we are disposed to
think that a new trial might well have been ordered as to the present appellant
by that court on the ground, there taken at bar, but not given effect to, that
the learned trial judge had, contrary to the prohibition of subs. 5 of s. 4 of
the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C, c. 59, alluded, in the course of his
charge, to the fact that the present appellant had not given evidence in his
own behalf, when he said,

Deux des accusés ont été entendus et le
troisième ne l’a pas été; c’êtait son droit. Ce sera à vous d’agir en
conséquence. Bigàouette v. The King[7].

It is always very unfortunate that a new trial
should become necessary because of some misdirection by a trial judge. It is
especially so where such misdirection is due to inattention to matters of
substance. It is sometimes not as fully realized as it should be that such
errors on the part of those charged with the conduct of criminal trials not
only put the country to very considerable expense but also lead to delays and
uncertainties in the administration of justice which are deeply regrettable.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of negligence in
performance of duty, causing grievous bodily injury—Cr. Code, ss. 284,
247—Momentary diversion of attention—Conduct not amounting to criminal
negligence.

Respondent was in charge of hoisting
machinery in a mine shaft. When a descending cage was nearing the bottom he was
required to arrest it and give warning to workmen below (a precaution required
by the mining regulations). A dial enabled him to follow the cage’s descent.
There was also a buzzer which operated at a certain point to warn him, but on
the occasion in question it was out of order. His attention to the dial was
momentarily diverted by a violent noise behind him from “clapperboards” (any
defective working of which it was his duty to report), and when his attention
was restored it was too late to arrest the cage and it struck a workman below.
Respondent

[Page 355]

was experienced and conscientious in his
duties. He was convicted under s. 284, Cr. Code, of causing grievous
bodily injury “by doing negligently or omitting to do an act which it was his
duty to do.”

Held: While
the arresting of the cage was indisputably one of those duties contemplated by
ss. 247 and 284, Cr. Code, yet the respondent’s act, almost involuntary,
in yielding, in the special circumstances, to the impulse to turn his eyes to
the source of the disturbance behind him, was not an act of such culpability as
falls within the category of criminal negligence.

McCarthy v. The King, 62 Can. S.C.R., 40, discussed and explained. The decision therein
did not attempt to lay down an abstract rule for determining the incidence of
criminal responsibility for negligence.

Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (63
Ont. Lit. 275) setting aside the conviction, affirmed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent by J.S. McKessock, Esq., Police
Magistrate for the District of Sudbury, for that the respondent

at the Town of Frood, in the District of
Sudbury, on or about the 23rd day of September, A.D. 1928, while acting as
hoistman in the mine of the International Nickel Company, by doing negligently
or omitting to do an act which it was his duty to do, did cause grievous bodily
injury to the person of Nestor Peltola, contrary to section 284  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada.

The appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was
brought under s. 1025  of the Criminal Code , leave to appeal being
granted by Smith J. The application for leave to appeal was made, on behalf of
the Attorney General for Ontario, on the ground that the judgment appealed from
conflicted with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex
v. McCarthy[2].

The material facts of the case are sufficiently
stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.

E. Bayly K.C. for the appellant.

J.J. O’Connor for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

DUFF J.—There is no material dispute as to the
primary facts. On the day the offence is alleged to have been committed, the
hoisting machinery in one of the shafts of the

[Page 356]

Frood Mine was in operation raising muck from
the bottom of the shaft. The accused was the hoistman in charge of this
machinery. There were two cages or skips raised and lowered simultaneously, at
the same rate of speed, by the same machinery. Part of the duty of the hoistman
was to arrest the machinery as the descending skip was nearing the bottom of
the shaft, to give warning of its approach to the workmen engaged there. On the
occasion in question, this precaution was not observed, and one of the workmen,
caught unawares, was struck by the skip and killed.

There was a dial which showed the position of
the skips at any moment, and a buzzer which, when working, announced the
arrival of the skips at points 100 feet from the top and bottom respectively.
On the occasion with which we are concerned, the buzzer was out of order.

It was the duty of the hoistman to follow the
ascent and descent of the skips, and for this purpose to give close attention
to the dial; but on the occasion in question, the attention of the accused was
diverted for a moment, and during that moment, the descending skip reached a
point so near the bottom of the shaft, that when his attention to the dial was
restored, he was too late, with the means at his command, to bring the skip to
rest and avert the tragedy.

The Mining Regulations require the arrest of the
descending skip for the protection of workmen engaged below, and the duty to
conform to the regulation is a duty of the strictest order. It is indisputably
one of those duties contemplated by sections 247  and 284  of the Criminal
Code . The question to be considered, is whether the momentary inattention
of the hoistman involved, under the circumstances, a breach of duty of the kind
that entails criminal responsibility.

The accused was an experienced hoistman, and
admittedly had been most conscientious in the performance of his duties. His
explanation of his conduct is that his attention was attracted by a violent
noise proceeding from some appliances known as “clapperboards,” situated behind
him, which appear to be groups of electrical contactors controlling the
hoisting apparatus. It was the duty of the hoistman to report any
irregularities in the working of the

[Page 357]

machinery, and these “clapperboards” had been
reported upon, but there had been some difficulty in precisely identifying the
nature of the defect. There were two sets of such appliances, and there had
been some doubt as to which of these was the seat of the trouble. With this in
his mind, on hearing the noise on the day of the accident, his attention was
immediately attracted with more than usual force to the “clapperboards.” It is
conceded that when these “clapperboards” are out of order, the noise proceeding
from them may be of a violent and disturbing nature. The official inspector and
the mining officials agree that this noise might be expected to produce some
distraction of the hoistman’s attention; that in the situation of the accused,
only a man of very steady nerves would be proof against the impulse to turn his
eyes to the source of the disturbance.

The almost involuntary act of the accused, in
yielding, in the special circumstances, to this impulse, does not appear to be
an act of such culpability as falls within the category of criminal negligence.
On this point the decision of the court below is manifestly right.

The contention advanced on behalf of the
Attorney General is, that, by force of sections 247  and 284  of the Criminal
Code , criminal responsibility ensues when there is neglect of a duty to
exercise reasonable care in the control of a thing, which, in the absence of
such care, may endanger human life; and that—at least where (as here) no
question of skill is involved—neglect of such a character as to give rise to
civil responsibility gives rise to criminal responsibility also. In support of
this proposition, the decision of this court in McCarthy v. The King[3] is cited.

This is a misapprehension of the effect of McCarthy’s
case3. Two of the judges who took part in that decision
expressed the view now advocated by the Attorney General, but that was not the
ground of the decision. In that case the court had to consider the charge of a
trial judge in a prosecution for manslaughter in these circumstances: the
accused, driving an automobile in a frequented street at about twelve miles an
hour, ran into a workman working in a manhole in the street and killed him. The
manhole was covered by a tarpaulin tent about three or

[Page 358]

four feet wide at the bottom, five or six feet
high and several feet long. The vision of the accused was obstructed owing to
the dirty condition of his windshield, and for this reason, he said that from
time to time he looked out from the side of the car, but failed to observe the
tarpaulin covering the manhole. The trial judge instructed the jury that if the
death of the deceased was due to “some want of ordinary care which an ordinary
prudent man would have observed in the driving of the car,” it was their duty
to convict. He directed their attention to the distinction between the degree
of negligence required to affect a defendant with liability in a civil case,
and the culpable negligence required to justify a conviction in a criminal
case; he presented to them, as the cardinal issue, the question whether the
accused was maintaining a “proper lookout”; and he told them, if they were
convinced that the accused, if he “had been looking ahead at all as a driver of
a motor car should have looked ahead,” would have seen the obstruction in the
street, they would be justified in finding him guilty of “culpable negligence.”
The trial judge reserved a question as to the correctness of his instruction
touching “the negligence which under the circumstances of the case would render
the accused guilty of manslaughter.”

The question so stated was the subject of the
enquiry in this court, and that inquiry involved an examination of the effect
of the sections of the Criminal Code  above mentioned, as applied to the
facts in evidence and the charge of the trial judge. The court was unanimous in
the view that failure to maintain a “proper lookout” amounted, in the
circumstances, to culpable negligence within the contemplation of the criminal
law, and that, speaking more generally, a want of ordinary care in
circumstances in which persons of ordinary habits of mind would recognize that
such want of care is not unlikely to imperil human life, falls within that
category. But the decision does not attempt to lay down an abstract rule for
determining the incidence of criminal responsibility for negligence.

This is all that is necessary for the
disposition of the appeal. We think it right to add that we see no reason to
differ from the view expressed by Sedgwick J., speaking for the majority of
this court, in Union Colliery Co. v. The

[Page 359]

Queen[4], that s. 247  (then
s. 213) of the Criminal Code  is a “mere statutory statement of the
common law.”

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

Builders’ Supply Co., Limited, W. & F. P. Currie & Co., Limited, and
Ontario Gypsum Co., Limited, appeal from a judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench affirming their conviction on an indictment laid against them under
section 498  of the Criminal Code . This indictment contains the following
counts:—

For having

at the city of Montreal, during the years 1924 and 1925, doing business together with other
unknown persons, conspired, combined, agreed and arranged with each other and
other persons unknown with view to unduly limit the facilities for producing,
manufacturing, supplying and dealing in

[Page 277]

that certain commodity or article known as
gypsum products, which said products are the subjects of trade and commerce;

For having

at the same time and place, conspired,
combined, agreed and arranged with each other and with other persons unknown to
restrain, injure trade and commerce in relation to such gypsum products;

For having

at the same time and place, unduly
prevented and lessened competition in the purchase, sale and supply of such
commodity and enhanced the price of the said commodity commonly known as gypsum
products.

The appellants, with their consent, were tried
before a judge (Mr. Justice Wilson) without a jury, were found guilty on the
three counts and were sentenced to pay a fine of $2,000 each.

They appealed from their conviction to the Court
of King’s Bench on questions stated to be questions of law alone, and on
questions stated to be questions of mixed law and fact. These appeals, heard
before Howard, Bernier and Rivard, JJ., were dismissed. Leave having been given
to pronounce separate judgments, Mr. Justice Howard delivered a dissenting
judgment, and the appellants now appeal on his grounds of dissent. They had
also applied for special leave to appeal to this court on the question of the
constitutionality of section 498 , but, as no conflict was shewn between the
judgment of the court below and the judgment of any other court of appeal, the
application was dismissed[1]. The
validity of section 498  Or. C, therefore, is not in issue in this case, the
only question submitted on the appeal, as I conceive it should be expressed,
being whether there was evidence on which a jury properly directed or a judge
sitting without a jury could convict the appellants on the charges laid against
them. This is of course a question of law, and it is on this point that Howard
J. dissented.

Section 498  of the Criminal Code —and we are
concerned merely with its effect—is in a subdivision of the code bearing the
title “Offences connected with trade and breaches of contract.” It will be
convenient to cite here sections 496 , 497 , 498  Cr. C, which together form a group dealing with what is known as “restraint
of trade.”

496. A conspiracy in restraint of trade is an
agreement between two or more persons to do or procure to be done any unlawful
act in restraint of trade.

[Page 278]

497. The purposes of a trade union are not,
by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, unlawful within the
meaning of the last preceding section.

498. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding four thousand dollars and not
less than two hundred dollars, or to two years’ imprisonment, or, if a
corporation, is liable to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and not
less than one thousand dollars, who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges
with any other person, or with any railway, steamship, steamboat or
transportation company,—

(a) to unduly limit the facilities
for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing in
any article or commodity which may be a subject of trade and commerce; or,

(b) to restrain or injure
trade or commerce in relation to any such article or commodity; or,

(c) to unduly prevent, limit, or
lessen the manufacture or production of any such article or commodity, or to
unreasonably enhance the price thereof; or,

(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production,
manufacturing, purchase, barter, sale;, transportation or supply of any such
article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or property.

2. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to apply to combinations of workmen or employees for their own
reasonable protection as such workmen or employees.

These provisions, and more especially section
498  Cr. C., were construed by this
court in Weidman v. Shragge[2], which, although not a criminal case, is
authority with regard to their meaning. I may quote what was stated by Mr.
Justice Duff at p. 37:—

I have no hesitation in holding that as a
rule an agreement having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment
of a virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce
throughout a considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in
that trade, comes under the ban of the enactment.

And Mr. Justice Anglin (as he then was), discussing
the meaning of the expression “unduly” in section 498  Cr. C, said at p. 42:—

The prime question certainly must be, does
it (the agreement alleged to foe obnoxious to section 498 ), however
advantageous or even necessary for the protection of the business interests of
the parties, impose improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive restrictions
upon that competition the benefit of which is the right of every one?

In view of this statement of the rule, it will
be unnecessary to refer to any of the English cases on which the appellants
rely. What we have to determine is whether there is evidence bringing this case
within the statute.

[Page 279]

There does not appear to be any dispute as to
the material facts.

About the end of 1913 an association called “the
plasterers’ association” was formed between certain manufacturers of gypsum
products and certain dealers in these commodities. It was composed of two
branches, the manufacturers and the dealers. There were four manufacturers: The
Albert Manufacturing Company, Limited, of Hillsborough, N.B.; The Windsor
Plaster Company, Limited, of Windsor, N.S.; The Iona Gypsum Company, Limited, of
Iona, N.S., and The Ontario
Gypsum Company, of Paris, Ontario. There were originally six dealers, all of Montreal: Alex. Bremner, Limited; Sitinson-Reeb Builders’ Supply Co.,
Limited; Wm. McNally & Co., Limited; Webster & Sons, Limited; W. and F.
P. Currie & Co., Limited, and Hyde & Sons.

Almost from the beginning and at all the times
with which we are concerned, one Alfred E. Balfry of Montreal was the secretary
of the association and practically its factotum, being paid by the
manufacturers and the dealers, and he also acted as chairman at the occasional
meetings of the association held in Montreal at his office, for the renting of
which, and other expenses, the members paid. There were also meetings of the
dealers alone, and at these Balfry presided, besides acting as secretary.
Minutes of proceedings at meetings were kept by Balfry. The association was not
incorporated.

I think there is no doubt that the forming of
this association was an advantage to its members. From the manufacturers’ point
of view the question of freights, and of the quantities of gypsum products to
be shipped to Montreal, was a
material consideration. The freight rates were equalized, by taking as a basis
the rate from Hillsborough, N.B., to Montreal. The manufacturers fixed their sale prices to the dealers, and also
the price at which the latter would sell their products on the Montreal market, and no sales could be made
for a lesser price. As far as concerned the Montreal market, the manufacturers agreed to sell to the dealers
exclusively, and the dealers could buy only from the manufacturers. Orders by
dealers for goods were handed by them to Balfry who distributed these orders
among the manufacturers. The testimony shews that, as matters stood, the trade
in Montreal

[Page 280]

could get these products only from the dealers,
and through the latter from the manufacturers/Shipments by other and more
distant manufacturers to Montreal were impracticable on account of the freight
rates and because, if a large quantity of products was shipped to Montreal, it
would have to be stored, which would increase its selling price. That a
monopoly of the trade in Montreal in gypsum products was secured by the plasterers’ association does
not appear to be open to doubt.

It may be emphasized here that the advantage
thus obtained by the manufacturers and dealers of the association is not the
proper test. What is the true test was laid down by this court in Weidman v. Shragge[3] as above stated. Injury to the public by
the hindering or suppressing of free competition, notwithstanding any advantage
which may accrue to the business interests of the members of the combine, is
what brings an agreement or a combination under the ban of section 498  Cr. C.

This injury is shewn by what occurred in
January, 1925. The six dealers met on’ January 13, passed a resolution
dissolving their association, and very shortly afterwards reformed it with five
members instead of six, Hyde & Sons, who say they did not vote on the
question of dissolution, being excluded. Of the forming of what he called a “family
of five” Balfry immediately advised the manufacturers. The effect of the
exclusion of Hyde & Sons was soon painfully apparent to the latter. They
booked with Balfry orders for gypsum products which they required to fill
contracts that they had made with builders. These products they were unable to
procure either through Balfry or by applying directly to the manufacturers.
They were told, to go to one of the five dealers, which meant purchasing the
goods at a considerably higher price, about $2 per ton more than the selling
price of the manufacturers to the dealers. This rendered it impossible for them
to fulfil their contracts and carry on their business. Balfry is very frank as
to the policy adopted towards Hyde & Sons. He is asked:—

Q. What objection had you to this plaster
coming to Montreal—what
business had you in that—what interests had you in that?

A. To see that Hyde did not get any plaster
in Montrea,

[Page 281]

Q. Why did you not want Mr. Hyde to have
plaster in Montreal?

A. Because I had made arrangements to
supply it only to the five other firms.

Counsel for the appellants contend that this is
merely a case of a manufacturer freely choosing or changing his selling agents.
It is very much more. It is a combination of manufacturers and dealers to
control an important market wherein the goods in which they deal can be
obtained only through them and at prices which they determine, free competition
by others in the same market being suppressed.

This was clearly shewn in the case of one O’Neil
who, shortly before the exclusion of Hyde & Sons, had brought to Montreal and stored there a large shipment
of plaster. When he attempted to compete with the dealers, the latter reduced
their prices, this operation being repeated several times, as O’Neil reduced
his, so that eventually O’Neil was forced out of the market and constrained to
sell the balance of his stock to one of the dealers. This is represented by the
appellants as being merely a rate war brought about by O’Neil’s action in
underselling the dealers. I think it shews that the association had rendered
competition impossible in the Montreal market. The evidence demonstrates that the manufacturers controlled
the price at which these goods were sold by the dealers to the public. Just one
quotation from the testimony of Balfry will establish this:—

Q. Dealers, as members of the association,
after having bought, under your control, from the manufacturers, were not at
liberty to sell to the public at whatever price they liked. Were they bound to
sell at a fixed price, and at fixed terms?

A. They were compelled at the price the
manufacturers thought right to charge the public.

Q. The dealers were not at liberty to sell
to suit their convenience?

A. I suppose, if they got into
collaboration with the manufacturers, they might be able to induce the
manufacturers to do what they wanted.

By Mr, Bertrand,
K.C.:

Q. They had to sell at a fixed price?

A. Yes.

By the Court:

Q. Not only the price, but the terms also?

A. Yes.

The prosecution here is against two of the
dealers and one of the manufacturers. I think these three companies

[Page 282]

agreed to all that was done, and it is no
objection that the others were not charged under the same indictment.

My conclusion is that there was evidence on
which the learned judge could find the appellants guilty of an offence against
section 498  of the Criminal Code , subsections (a), (b) and (d).

The appeal should therefore be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Motion for leave to
appeal from judgment of Second Divisional Court of Appellate Division,
Ont.—Alleged conflict with judgment of an “other court of appeal” in “a like
case” (Cr. Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 1025)—First Divisional Court of same
Appellate Division an “other court of appeal”—Alleged error in trial judge’s
charge to jury.

The First Divisional Court of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario is, in relation to the Second Divisional
Court, an “other court of appeal” within the meaning of s. 1025 of the Cr.
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36.

The judgment of the Second Divisional Court
(33 O.W.N. 301) dismissing an appeal from a conviction on a charge of rape,
which conviction was attacked on the ground of error in the charge to the jury,
was held not to be in conflict with the judgment of the First Divisional Court
in R. v. Hall (31 O.W.N. 451) or with the judgment of this Court
in Brooks v. The King ([1927] S.C.R. 633), neither of them being
“a like case” (Cr. Code, s. 1025) to that in question; and a motion for
leave to appeal to this Court was refused.

MOTION for leave to appeal to this Court from
the judgment of the Second Divisional Court of the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario[1]
dismissing the accused’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of rape. The
motion was made on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed from
conflicts with the judgment of the First Divisional Court of the said Appellate
Division in Rex v. Hall[2] and
with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Brooks v. The
King[3]. The
material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now
reported. The motion was dismissed.

[Page 157]

MIGNAULT J.—Francis Hill, who was convicted on
an indictment for rape on the person of a Mrs. Hazel Blow, has applied to
me for leave to appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Second Appellate
Divisional Court of Ontario which confirmed the conviction. Hill was a taxi
driver of Fort Frances, Ont., and the crime was committed about one o’clock of
the morning of the 16th of September, 1927. The complainant had come to Fort
Frances on the 15th to get some provisions, and could only return home the following
day. She registered at the Fort Frances Hotel, and employed Hill, whom she had
never seen before, to drive her to a dance at Pithers’ Point, a pleasure resort
some three miles from Fort Frances. She returned from the dance in Hill’s taxi,
a closed sedan car, and her story is that when she reached Fort Frances, Hill
insisted on her going for a drive with him. It was on this drive, on a cross
road, that the crime was committed, Hill, according to the complainant’s
testimony, having forced her to leave the front seat which she occupied with
him and to go on to the rear seat where she was assaulted by him.

The trial took place at Fort Frances before
Mr. Justice Logie, and the only point in dispute—Hill having admitted that
he had connection with the complainant on the occasion mentioned by her—was
whether the connection was with or without her consent. On this point, the
Crown undertook to show that the prosecutrix complained of the assault at the
first reasonable opportunity. Hill brought her back to the hotel after the
assault. She saw the night clerk there, but said nothing to him of the matter.
The next morning she went to see Dr. Hartrey of Fort Frances to get a
prescription for a friend. Dr. Hartrey had already treated her, and she says
she wanted to speak to him about the assault, but did not have the courage to
do so. She took the two o’clock train home, to Bear Pass, where her husband was
station agent, and on her arrival told him the whole story. The following day
Mrs. Blow returned to Fort Frances, and laid before the Crown Attorney a
complaint against Hill. It was said that the complainant did not make any
outcry, but, as far as she knew, there was no house in the vicinity, and it was
about one o’clock in the morning.

[Page 158]

On the question of complaint by the prosecutrix,
the learned trial judge gave the following instructions to the jury:

In this class of case certain statements
made after the event are admissible. Statements made after the transaction are
generally irrelevant and inadmissible in favour of the person making them, but
in cases of rape and similar offences the fact that a complaint was made by the
prosecutrix shortly after the alleged occurrence, and the particulars of such
complaint may, so far as they relate to the charge be given in evidence by the
prosecution not as evidence of acts complained of but as evidence of the
consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the
witness box and to negative consent.

Now, that class of evidence is admissible,
of course, where consent is or is not material evidence in the charge, but the
complaint must be shown to be made at the first opportunity which reasonably
presents itself after the commission of the offence.

I admitted the statement to her husband
because I felt on the evidence it was the first reasonable opportunity she had
to make the complaint. She did not make complaint to the hotel clerk. She
thought of making it to her doctor, but she said she could not bring herself to
do it, and then she went home and within 12 hours, or whatever time it was,
told her husband. If I am wrong in admitting that and I do not think I am
wrong, the prisoner will get the benefit if he appeals. But I have admitted the
statement and have told you the effect of the complaint and you are not to
consider it as anything other than what I have told you.

Counsel for Hill contended that by the final
words of the passage just quoted the learned trial judge had in effect
instructed the jury that they must consider that the complaint had been made by
the complainant on the earliest reasonable opportunity. In my view, the final
words, fairly construed with the context, refer to what the learned judge had
already told the jury, that “particulars of such complaint may, so far as they
relate to the charge, be given by the prosecution, not as evidence of acts
complained of, but as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the
prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box and to negative
consent.” There was no objection to the charge, and if the passage quoted could
be misconstrued, the prisoner’s counsel did not call the learned judge’s
attention to it.

I have referred to these circumstances somewhat
in detail in order to determine whether, as contended by counsel for the prisoner,
and that is the only question with which I am concerned, the unanimous judgment
of the appellate court herein is in conflict with the decision of

[Page 159]

another court of appeal in a like case (s. 1025 Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36).

The decision to which counsel for the prisoner
referred me is Rex v. Hall, of which there is a short report in
31 Ontario Weekly Notes, p. 451, but counsel furnished me with a complete copy
of the judgment which I have very carefully considered. This is a decision of
the First Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario, rendered on the 17th of
February, 1927, whereby a conviction for rape before the same trial judge was
set aside and a new trial ordered because the trial judge had misdirected the
jury and had failed to place the defence fully and fairly before them.

Mr. Rogers contended that this decision
cannot be said to be a decision of “another court of appeal,” as required by s.
1025, inasmuch as both divisions of the Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario
are one court of appeal, so that the decision now in question is a judgment of
the same court of appeal as that which decided the other case. He relied on the
definition of the words “court of appeal” in s. 2, subs. 7, of the Criminal
Code , and also on the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 88,
ss. 4 and 11.

I am unable to accept this contention.
Section 2, subsection 7, of the Criminal Code  states that
“court of appeal” includes, in the province of Ontario “the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Ontario.” This Appellate Division is composed of two
Divisional Courts, numbered consecutively and designated the First Divisional
Court and the Second Divisional Court (Ontario Judicature Act, ss. 39
and 40). The Chief Justice of Ontario and four Justices of Appeal form the
First Divisional Court, and the Second is composed of a Chief Justice and four
Justices of Appeal. I cannot doubt that they are distinct appellate courts, and
one of them in contradistinction to the other would be not misdescribed by
calling it “another court of appeal” within the meaning of s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code . A conflict on a question of law between these two courts is not
readily conceivable, but if it did arise, it obviously would create such a
situation as Parliament must have contemplated when it enacted s. 1025 . The ratio
legis here strongly applies and there is certainly

[Page 160]

nothing in the language of the
section which prevents its being carried out.

This brings me back to Rex v. Hall[4], and the only matter to be considered is
whether it conflicts with the unanimous judgment of the Second Appellate
Division in the present case. Of course, it must be “a like case,” and I take
it that the conflict mentioned by s. 1025  is a conflict on a question of law. I
do not think there was any such conflict or difference of opinion between the
First Appellate Division in the Hall Case4 and the Second
Appellate Division in this case as to the duty of a trial judge in instructing
the jury. Everything turned on the circumstances of the particular case and, in
my opinion, the facts in the Hall Case4, were materially
different from those in the present one. The appellate court there was of
opinion that the trial judge had practically told the jury to disregard
evidence showing that the complainant “was not in the state of mind of one who
has been outraged and desired to make an outcry about it.” Moreover, in the Hall
Case[5], there
was evidence of admissions by the complainant that previously she had had
connection with the prisoner, and she did not deny in rebuttal the statement of
the prisoner that he had had sexual intercourse with her about twenty-five
times. The appellate court further found that the trial judge had not placed
the defence fully and fairly before the jury. In my opinion, the present case
stands on an altogether different footing.

I may perhaps further add that Rex v. Hall5
could not be considered as an authority in a case where the facts were not the
same. In other words, it is not “a like case.” To borrow the well known language
of Lord Haldane in Kreglinger v. New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage
Co. Ltd.[6],

when a previous case has not laid down any
new principle but has merely decided that a particular set of facts illustrates
an existing rule, there are few more fertile sources of fallacy than to search
in it for what is simply resemblance in circumstances, and to erect a previous
decision into a governing precedent merely on this account.

Counsel for the prisoner also sought to show a
conflict between this case and the recent judgment of this court in

[Page 161]

Brooks v. The
King. To the latter case, what I have said of Rex v. Hall may
well apply, for an established rule of law was applied to a particular set of
facts. In Brooks v. The King, this court in substance found that
the trial judge had not, under the circumstances, fairly charged the jury. I am
unable to find any conflict between it and this case.

Upon the whole, I do not think that the decision
from which the prisoner seeks leave to appeal is in conflict with the judgment
of any other court of appeal in a like case. The application for leave to
appeal is therefore dismissed.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Trial—Circumstantial
evidence—Rule as to evidence consistent with innocence or guilt of
accused—Verdict of guilty by the jury—Proper direction as to rule—Conviction
affirmed by appellate court—Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada—Whether this
Court should interfere with the verdict of the jury.

Where the evidence in a criminal case is
purely circumstantial and the jury has been properly instructed within the rule
as to the value of circumstantial evidence, the verdict of the jury finding the
accused

[Page 297]

guilty is equivalent to a finding that, in
the minds of the jury, the inferences to be drawn from the evidence were
consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any other
reasonable conclusion, i.e., with the absence of guilt. Likewise, an appellate
court could also decide, on the evidence, whether the facts were such as to be
equally consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of the accused, and
accordingly quash the verdict. But, before this Court, when the accused does
not urge any ground of complaint against the direction of the trial judge and
the evidence is such that the jury might, and could, legally and properly draw
an inference of guilt, as held by the appellate court, it is not for the Court
to decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the accused was
guilty.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellants
by a jury on charges of conspiracy and other offences under the Customs and
Excise Act.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.

Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.

J. Crankshaw for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Rinfret J.—The appellants were tried and convicted by a jury in the Court of
King’s Bench, district of Montreal.

The indictment laid against them contains some
nine counts, charging them with the offences of conspiracy and with different
offences under the Customs and Excise Act The appellant Fraser was found
guilty on all counts charged against him. The appellant Brabant was also found
guilty on all counts charged against him (eight in number). The appellant
Pharand was found guilty on four counts representing what may be called the
overt acts, but not guilty on the different counts charging conspiracy.

An appeal was lodged by each of them to the
Court of King’s Bench (appeal side) which confirmed the verdict and maintained
the sentences in each case. The judgment was unanimous; and the appellants are
now before this Court as a result of leave granted by a judge of the Court[1].

[Page 298]

Under the Criminal Code , no appeal lies to the
Supreme Court of Canada on behalf of any person convicted of an indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed, except “on any question of law on
which there has been dissent in the court of appeal” (Cr. Code, sec. 1023), or “if
leave to appeal is granted by a judge” of the Court (Cr. Code, sec. 1025).

In the first case, the appeal is limited to the
question of law which has been the object of the dissent in the court of
appeal. In the second case, leave can be granted, and this Court holds
jurisdiction, only

if the judgment appealed from conflicts
with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.

In the present case, it was common ground that
all the evidence upon which the appellants were found guilty was circumstantial
evidence. And the point of law on which the judgment appealed from allegedly
conflicted with judgments of other courts of appeal in Canada was that the well
known rule laid down by Baron Alderson, as far back as the Hodge case[2], and generally accepted and acted upon
throughout Canada, had been misinterpreted and misapplied by the Quebec court
of appeal in this instance.

At the conclusion of the argument and having had
the advantage of a complete perusal of the record, we had some doubt as to
whether the conflict which seemed to be apparent at first sight—and which alone
stands as the foundation of our jurisdiction—did not exist perhaps more in the
expression rather than in the real intention of the judgment a quo.

As was observed in McLean v. The King[3], “there is no single exclusive formula”
whereby the rule may be stated. It is, however, a rule of general application,
and some of the statements made by the learned judge who delivered the judgment
of the court were of a nature to convey the meaning that there were exceptions
to the rule. After having stated that one fact in the chain of circumstances
proven was conclusive of the appellants’ guilt, the learned judge added:

On conviendra, je
crois, qu’un tel fait, lorsqu’il se produit, doive mettre en échec la
règle de droit sus-mentionnée

[Page 299]

a statement apparently suggesting that the
present case was one where the rule should not apply. But, at the hearing
before the Court, counsel for the Crown was able to show that, taking the
judgment as a whole, the statement was susceptible of being understood as
indicating that, in view of the existence, in the chain of evidence, of this
outstanding fact found to be conclusive, no further doubt could subsist as to
the guilt of the accused. As a result of this interpretation of the learned
judge’s statement, instead of excepting this case from the application of the
rule, on the contrary, he would thus be applying the rule and declaring that,
as a consequence of that rule, the evidence surrounding the main pivoting fact
established in the case was conclusive of the appellants’ guilt and
incompatible with the theory of their innocence.

However, having now heard the appeal, and more
particularly in view of the result presently to be announced, there would not
be much object in entering upon a more complete discussion of the issue in
respect to the conflict, except in mentioning, as we have just done, the state
of mind in which the Court was left after a full consideration of the able
argument presented to us and a careful examination of the whole record.

We will, therefore, proceed to express our view
upon the merits of the point submitted by counsel for the appellants which is,
in effect, that there was no legal evidence upon which a jury might find a
verdict of guilty in the circumstances. The argument of the learned counsel was
that, in a case where all the evidence is circumstantial, should the court of
appeal not be satisfied, upon its own findings, that the circumstances proven
were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that
the prisoner was the guilty person, it ought to quash the verdict on the ground
that there was not sufficient legal evidence to support it.

Although, as a general rule, the question
whether the proper inference has been drawn by the jury from facts established
in evidence is really not a question of law, but purely a question of fact, for
their consideration (Gauthier

[Page 300]

v. The King)[4], there is authority for the view that the
rule with regard to circumstantial evidence is not exclusively a rule in
respect of the direction which it is the duty of the trial judge to give to the
jury or a rule solely for the guidance of a trial judge unassisted by a jury.

We were referred to, at least, two cases where
the Court of Criminal Appeal in England set aside verdicts and quashed
convictions when, after having considered the evidence as a whole, it seemed to
the Court to be clear that the evidence was as consistent with the innocence of
the accused as with his guilt.

In Rex. v. Bookbinder[5], the accused was convicted of larceny by a
jury at Derbyshire assizes upon wholly circumstantial evidence. The appeal was
heard by Heward L.C.J., Avory and Acton JJ. Counsel for the Crown argued that
the jury were entitled to convict as the case depended solely on the proper inference
to be drawn from the evidence. The Court came to the conclusion that there was
no evidence which was not as consistent with the innocence as with the guilt of
the appellant. Mr. Justice Avory, speaking for the Court, said:

We think that the verdict was
unsatisfactory and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. The
appeal will be allowed and the conviction quashed.

In Rex v. Carter[6], the accused appealed against his
conviction for indecent assault at Cheshire sessions. The ground for the appeal
was that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury in convicting the
appellant. The Court was composed of Mr. Justice Avory, Mr. Justice Hawks and
Mr. Justice Humphreys. The evidence was circumstantial only. Again Mr. Justice
Avory pronounced the judgment of the Court. Summing up the case, he said:

When we come to consider the evidence as a
whole, it seems to be clear that the evidence is as consistent with the
innocence of the appellant as with his guilt.

In all the circumstances, we have come to the
conclusion that this conviction was unsatisfactory and cannot be supported,
having regard to the evidence.

The appeal is allowed and the conviction
quashed.

It would appear, therefore, that, when the
evidence in a criminal case is purely circumstantial and at the same

[Page 301]

time equally consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England regards
that evidence as insufficient to justify the jury in convicting, holds the
verdict unsatisfactory and quashes the conviction, on the ground that it cannot
be supported, having regard to the evidence.

To a certain extent, this would assimilate
verdicts based on circumstantial evidence “as consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused” to verdicts where it is claimed that there is no
evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of appeal is
empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are
unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of
sufficient legal evidence to support them.

Let it be granted, however, that such a question
should be deemed a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, when once it is
established that the evidence is of such a character that the inference of
guilt of the accused might, and could, legally and properly be drawn therefrom,
the further question whether guilt ought to be inferred in the premises is one
of fact within the province of the jury (Reinblatt v. The King).[7]

The appellants do not complain of the judge’s
charge to the jury. No objection was entered by them at the trial; indeed,
counsel for the appellants freely admitted at bar that the charge was not open
to objection. The direction there given upon the particular point dealing with
the duty of the jury with regard to the value of circumstantial evidence and
the standard by which it should be measured in the premises appears to us to
have been as comprehensive as could be required. The jury was in substance told
that, in order to reach a verdict of guilty, it should be satisfied, not only
that the circumstances proven were consistent with the appellants having
committed the acts, but they should also be satisfied that the facts were such
as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
appellants were guilty of the charges brought against them.

In the face of that direction, the jury found
the appellants guilty. The jury having been properly instructed,

[Page 302]

within the terms of the rule, their verdict is
equivalent to a finding that the inferences to be drawn from the evidence were
consistent with the guilt of the appellants, and inconsistent with any other
reasonable conclusion, and that is to say: with the absence of guilt. After the
direction they were given, the jury must be taken to have eliminated all
possibility of the innocence of the appellants as a rational inference from the
facts as they believed and understood them.

Likewise, the court of appeal, to which the case
was brought under sec 1013 of the Criminal Code , could decide, on the evidence
in this case, that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the appellants were guilty.

The appellants having no ground of complaint
against the direction of the trial judge and the evidence being such that the
jury might, and could, legally and properly draw the inference of guilt, as
held by the Court of King’s Bench (appeal side), it is not for this Court to
decide whether the jury ought or not to have inferred that the appellants were
guilty.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Theft—Shipping—Customs Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 42 (as amended), ss. 207, 151, 2 (o)—Vessel hovering within
territorial waters of Canada
with dutiable goods on board—Pursuit by police cruiser—Continuity of
pursuit—Seizure of vessel on high seas—Forcible escape of vessel—Forfeiture of
vessel—Time of forfeiture—Charge of theft against master—Form of charge.

The schooner K., of Canadian registry,
of which appellant was master, while “hovering within the territorial waters of
Canada” off the

[Page 514]

shores of Cape Breton with a cargo of liquor on board (dutiable in Canada), was approached by a Canadian
police cruiser, and proceeded towards the high seas. It was overhauled within
the territorial waters and summoned to “heave to in the King’s name,” but
before it could be boarded it resumed its course. The cruiser pursued for a
short distance, then turned, picked up its boat which had been lowered for
boarding, and hurried towards shore for about eight miles, then took bearings
and received instructions by radio, and returned to the pursuit and overhauled
and stopped the K. on the high seas about 35 miles from shore. Here its
officers boarded the K., asked appellant what cargo he had, were told in
answer “a bit of liquor,” asked to see and did see the manifest and shipping
papers, and without further examination took the K. in charge and towed
it back to a point within three miles of shore, where appellant, on some claim
of navigation dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the K.’s helm,
turned it out of its course, thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away.
The cruiser did not pursue. At trial appellant was convicted of theft of the
schooner and theft of its cargo.

Held: The K.,
at the time when appellant took it away from the officers, was lawfully
under seizure and in control of the officers, and the convictions of theft must
stand (Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 9 M.P.R.
97, affirmed). The effect of ss. 207 , 151  and 2  (o) of the Customs
Act  (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, as amended), when applied to the facts of this
case, is that, by hovering in territorial waters of Canada with dutiable goods
on board, the K. thereby became forfeited by operation of law. When the
presence of liquor in its cargo was established as a fact, the forfeiture
related back to the time of the hovering. The forfeiture was the legal
unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. The seizing on the
high seas was part of the prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the
territorial waters, and there temporarily frustrated by the K.’s flight,
was consummated on the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit
was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit.

Objection on the ground that, according to
the charge, the vessel taken by appellant was one which had “been seized and
detained on suspicion by * * * as forfeited,” was rejected. The words,
“suspicion,” etc., were unnecessary, and when deleted left the allegation as
being “seized * * * as forfeited,” which phrase falls within the definition
“seized and forfeited” within s. 2 (o) of the Act.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1],
affirming (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) his conviction, on trial before
Doull J. with a jury, for theft of a schooner and theft of its cargo. (Accused
was also convicted of obstructing a public officer in the execution of his
duty, which conviction was affirmed by the said Court en banc. Accused
appealed thereon to this Court with regard to the sentence). The accused was
master of the vessel in question

[Page 515]

and the alleged theft was in taking it away
from the officers of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser when, it was
alleged, it was lawfully under seizure and in the control of those officers.
The questions in issue turned on the meaning and effect of certain provisions
of the Customs Act . The material facts of the case and questions in
issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was
dismissed.

W. P. Potter for
the appellant.

G. McL. Daley K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Dysart J. (ad hoc)—This appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia affirming the conviction of the appellant on three charges—(1) theft of
a schooner, (2) theft of the cargo of the vessel, and (3) obstructing a public
officer in the discharge of his duty—turns on the meaning and effect of certain
provisions of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 42, and amendments. The dissent on which this appeal is based, opens
up the whole case on the charges of theft.

In the early morning of December 6, 1933, the
schooner Kromhout, of
Canadian registry, of which the appellant was master, was “hovering within the
territorial waters of Canada” off the shores of Cape Breton, with a cargo of
liquor on board. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser, No. 4, which
had been lying in wait, approached her, the Kromhout started up her engines, and, with set sails, proceeded towards the
high seas, but was overhauled before she got beyond the territorial waters and
was summoned to “heave to in the King’s name”—a summons she obeyed only after a
few shots were fired across her bows. A boat was lowered from the cruiser, and officers
thereof set out to row to the schooner, but, before the boat got well away, the
Kromhout resumed her course
towards the high seas. The cruiser pursued for a short distance, and then,
turning about, picked up the boat and hurried towards shore for a distance of
about eight miles, where, after taking bearings and receiving radio
instructions, she returned to the pursuit, and about noon 

[Page 516]

hour overhauled the Kromhout
on the high seas, about thirty-five miles from
shore. Here the schooner was stopped, boarded, and, after some discussion, was
taken in charge by the cruiser’s men, and towed back to a point within three
miles of the shore. At this point the accused, on some pretence of navigation
dangers to his vessel, forcibly took charge of the helm of the Kromhout, turned her out of her course,
thereby breaking the tow lines, and sailed away. This time the cruiser did not
pursue. By arrangement, the
vessel and crew were later, near the French colony of St.
 Pierre, surrendered to Canadian officers without
prejudice to their rights.

When the cruiser’s officers boarded the schooner
on the high seas, they asked the accused what cargo he had and were told, “a
bit of liquor.” They asked to see the manifest and shipping papers, and did see
them, but these were in French and not fully understood. They made no further
examination of the vessel or of the cargo or of the accused. The vessel, as a
matter of fact, had on board seven hundred and fifty-one kegs of rum which were
dutiable in Canada.

Upon these facts the accused was tried at Halifax, N.S., before Doull J. with a jury, and convicted on the three counts
mentioned, and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on each count, the
sentences to run concurrently. This conviction was upheld on appeal, Mellish
and Carroll JJ. dissenting. The jurisdiction of the trial court in cases such
as this to deal with offences committed on the high seas, is conferred by s.
656  of the Criminal Code .

On this appeal we have to determine whether or
not the Kromhout when the accused
took her away from the police officers, was lawfully under seizure and in the
control of those officers. The language of the charge is that the accused
committed the theft by unlawfully taking the Kromhout openly and with force

without the permission of * * * the person
who seized the same, or some competent authority and before the said vessel had
been declared by competent authority to have been seized without due cause, the
said vessel having been seized and detained on suspicion by the said Moyle A.
Hyson, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as forfeited under
section 207  of the Customs Act .

The provisions of the Customs Act  by
which this case is governed are not confined to s. 207 —they include other

[Page 517]

provisions which may now be set out, so far as
necessary. By section 151,

If any vessel is hovering in territorial
waters of Canada, any officer
may go on board such vessel and examine her cargo and may also examine the
master or person in command upon oath touching the cargo and voyage and may
bring the vessel into port (Subs. 1).

Such vessel “shall proceed to come to a stop
when required so to do in the King’s name by any officer” (Subs. 2); and upon
such vessel’s “failing to proceed to come to a stop when required,” the captain
or master of the Government cruiser may, after first causing a gun to be fired
as a signal, fire at or into such vessel (Subs. 3). Further particulars of the
rights and powers of such revenue officers in dealing with such a vessel are
set out in subs. 8. Section 207  reads:—

If upon the examination by any officer of
the cargo of any vessel hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any dutiable
goods or any goods the importation of which into Canada is prohibited are found
on board, such vessel with her apparel, rigging, tackle, furniture, stores and
cargo shall be seized and forfeited * * *

The term “hovering” is not defined by the Act,
but is a term understood by mariners to mean something like fluttering about,
neither coming nor going, in an undecided manner. The term “territorial waters
of Canada,” so far as applicable to this case, means the waters “within twelve
marine miles” of the Dominion of Canada (s. 151 (7)). “Officer” means an
officer of customs (s. 2 (l)). By s. 2 (o)

“seized and forfeited,” “liable to
forfeiture” or “subject to forfeiture,” or any other expression which might of
itself imply that some act subsequent to the commission of the offence is
necessary to work the forfeiture, shall not be construed as rendering any such
subsequent act necessary, but the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by
the commission of the offence, in respect of which the penalty or forfeiture is
imposed.

Section 143 was also referred to, but really
adds nothing to sections 151  and 207 . It seems to have been assumed that a
cargo of rum was dutiable goods in Canada and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser and men were
acting in discharge of public duty.

The effect of the foregoing provisions, when
applied to the facts of this case, is that by hovering in territorial waters of
Canada with dutiable goods on
board, the Kromhout thereby
became forfeited by operation of law. Proof of the forfeiture itself was
established after the offence had

[Page 518]

been committed, that is, when the officers
stopped and boarded the Kromhout and ascertained from the captain (the master) that dutiable goods
were on board. The fact of hovering was established beyond peradventure by the
general finding of the jury under quite proper directions. The seizing of the Kromhout on the high seas was part of the
prolonged or continued act, which, begun within the territorial waters, and
there temporarily frustrated by the flight of the schooner, was consummated on
the high seas; and the temporary abandonment of the pursuit of the schooner by
the cruiser was not such an abandonment as broke the continuity of the pursuit.
When the presence of liquor in the schooner’s cargo was established as a fact,
the forfeiture which followed as a matter of law related back to the time of
the hovering in territorial waters. The authority given to officers to stop and
board vessels and examine them and their cargoes is intended for no other
purpose than to establish whether or not an offence has in fact been committed.
The forfeiture itself is not brought about by any act of officers, but is the
legal unescapable consequence of the commission of the offence. A failure to
establish that liquor was on board a vessel so hovering, would not mean that
the offence had not been committed, but that the commission had not been
proved.

It is objected that the charge is defective in
that it alleges that the accused took a vessel that had “been seized and
detained on suspicion * * * as forfeited.” This objection, however,
seems to be rather technical, and not of the substance of the matter. The words
“suspicion,” etc., were really quite unnecessary and when deleted leave the
allegation as being “seized * * * as forfeited,” and this phrase, I think,
falls within the definition “seized and forfeited” within s. 2 (o).

Some complaint has also been made that the
charge of the trial judge was not correct, but I find nothing in it that can
properly be objected to in substance.

On the charges of theft, therefore, conviction
must stand.

On the remaining charge—obstructing officers—the
conviction itself is not in dispute. As to the sentence, it is not perfectly
clear that the dissenting judges held it to be illegal. Mr. Justice Mellish
says, “I think it is excessive”.

[Page 519]

Unless they dissented on the ground that it was
illegal, this court has no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Our
jurisdiction is strictly limited to controversies in relation to some question
of law on which there has been dissent. Whatever may be the proper construction
of the judgments of Mr. Justice Mellish and Mr. Justice Carroll on this point,
we think, since the sentence under the conviction upon the charge of
obstruction runs concurrently with that under the conviction on the charges of
theft, no useful purpose could be served by modifying it, although we are
disposed to agree that, even if not illegal, it is excessive.

The appeal should be dismissed and the
conviction affirmed.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Court of appeal judgment conflicting with judgment of another court of
appeal “in a like case”—Judgments must be in criminal matters—The Supreme Court
of Canada is a “court of appeal” within section 1025 Cr. C.

Under the provisions of section 1025  of the Criminal Code , a
party applying for leave to appeal must show that “the judgment appealed from
conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.”

Held that a judgment of a court of appeal “in a like
case” must be a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings or upon criminal
matters.

Held, also, that the Supreme Court of Canada is
comprised among the courts of appeal contemplated in that section.

MOTION under section 1025  of the Criminal Code  for leave to
appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
upholding the conviction of the appellants. Leave to appeal was refused by the
judgment now reported.

A.N. Lewis K.C. for the motion.

J. Sedgewick K.C. contra.

RINFRET J.—Upon their trial before His Honour Judge Boles,
sitting in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the county of Wentworth,
the appellants were found guilty of having unlawfully, after the presentation
of a

[Page 610]

bankruptcy petition against them, condoned and participated in
the making and presenting of a false statement to the creditors of Minden’s
Ltd. for the purpose of obtaining the consent of the creditors or any of them
to an agreement accepting fifteen cents on the dollar in full of the debt of
Minden’s Limited, and of having thereby committed an offence contrary to ss.
191 (p) and 201 of the Bankruptcy Act.

The Court of Appeal of Ontario confirmed the conviction.

The appellants now apply for leave to appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal on the ground that the judgment conflicts with that of the
Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Electric Motor and Machinery Company,
Limited v. The Bank of Montreal[1].

To understand the situation, it is necessary to state only a few
facts.

Minden, after the presentation of the bankruptcy petition, on the
16th December, 1932, attempted to make an arrangement with the creditors and to
obtain a composition from them. To persuade them to accept his offer, he caused
to be prepared a statement of assets and liabilities. Both courts found that
the statement so prepared to form the basis of the negotiations was fraudulent
and falsely represented the true assets, altogether omitting, as it did, a
large block of goods which he pretended not to regard as seasonable stock.

The statement was made on the 20th December, 1932. The actual
adjudication in bankruptcy did not take place until the 27th December.

One of the questions which the Court of Appeal had to decide was whether
a false and fraudulent statement made between the date of presentation of the
petition in bankruptcy and the date of the adjudication in bankruptcy may be
held an offence under subsection (p) of section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act.

The Court of Appeal referred to subsection 11 of section 4 of the
Act, which reads as follows:—

11. The bankruptcy of a debtor shall be deemed to have
relation back to and to commence at the time of the presentation of the
petition on which a receiving order is made against him.

[Page 611]

And the Court ruled that the effect of that statutory provision
was to make the bankruptcy begin at the time of the presentation of the
petition for all purposes.

Accordingly the decision was that the accused must be found to
have made the false and fraudulent statement after having been adjudged
bankrupt, and contrary to subsection (p) of section 191. And the appeal
was dismissed.

In the case of Electric Motor & Machinery Company, Limited
v. The Bank of Montreal[2], the
Court had to construe subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act. The debtor had made an authorized assignment on the
3rd November, 1930. Subsequently, through its trustee, it submitted for
approval to the bankruptcy court a proposal for a compromise. The demand of
approval was contested by the Bank of Montreal. The bankruptcy court found as a
fact that in and during the years 1927, 1928 and 1929, the authorized assignor
had knowingly made to the bank three false statements of the character
described in subsections (q) and (r); that these were offences
under the subsections mentioned, and that

this being established, the court, under art. 16, parag. 2,
of the Bankruptcy Act, was bound to refuse the approval of the proposal
of compromise.

In the Court of King’s Bench (Quebec), that judgment was upheld
by the majority of the court (Létourneau and Saint-Germain JJ. dissenting).

Upon appeal to this Court, it was held that the acts dealt with
in subsections (q) and (r) of section 191 are in terms the acts
of a person

who has been adjudged bankrupt, or in respect of whose
estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made an authorized
assignment,

and that, upon the plain meaning of the words, the offences
described in the subsections in question had reference to the acts of a person
who had already been adjudged bankrupt, etc. Therefore, the acts complained of,
committed prior to the bankruptcy, were not criminal acts within the
contemplation of subsections (q) and (r) of section 191.

On the present application it was urged on behalf of the
appellants that subsection (p) is couched in language similar to that of
subsections (q) and (r), and that, therefore, the judgment sought
to be appealed from is in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric
Motor case2.

[Page 612]

The application is made under section 1025  of the Criminal Code .
The appellants must show that

the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of
any other court of appeal in a like case.

Section 1012  of the Criminal Code  defines the interpretation to
be given to the words “court of appeal” in part 19 dealing with Procedure by
Indictment. Those words mean

the court designated by paragraph (7) of section two of this
Act as the court of appeal for the province in which the conviction was had.

If we refer to paragraph (7) of section two, we find that it
enumerates the courts of appeal of final resort in each of the nine provinces
of Canada and in the Yukon Territory. The Supreme Court of Canada is not
mentioned in the enumeration.

Notwithstanding this, I think the Supreme Court of Canada is
among the courts contemplated in section 1025 of the Act under the words: “any
other court of appeal”; and I think it has always been so regarded, both in the
discussion and in the judgments upon applications for leave similar to the
present one (See: Hill v. The King)[3],
although perhaps the point was not expressly decided.

The object of the section being to insure uniformity of
interpretation and of application of the criminal law throughout the Dominion,
it stands to reason that a conflict between the judgment of a provincial court
of appeal and that of the Supreme Court of Canada must necessarily have been
one which Parliament had in view when it enacted the section. The Supreme Court
of Canada is a court to which, by force of the Criminal Code , an appeal may be
brought in certain cases involving criminal matters; and, in that respect, it
satisfies the language of section 1025 : “any other court of appeal.”

Therefore, I consider that it was open to the appellants to base
their application upon an alleged conflict between the judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Ontario in the present case and the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada in the Electric Motor case[4].

But when it comes to the next point raised by counsel
representing the Attorney-General of Ontario, the appellants do not fare so
well. In Electric Motor & Machinery Company Limited v. The Bank of
Montreal4, the sub-

[Page 613]

ject-matter of the case was not criminal law. As appears by the
short statement of the facts made at the beginning of this judgment, the Electric
Motor case4 was about the approval of a proposal for a
compromise. It was only indirectly and as an incident to the main question that
the court was called upon to construe subsections (q) and (r) of
section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. It was not done for the purpose of
deciding whether the debtor had to be convicted of the criminal offence covered
by the section, but only with the view of adjudicating upon the application for
approval of the compromise. Obviously this was not a criminal proceeding.

Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the judgment in
the Electric Motor case[5] does
not meet the condition required in section 1025  that it should be “the judgment
of any other court of appeal in a like case.”

Repeating again that the purpose of the section is to render as
uniform as possible the administration of the law in criminal matters, The
King v. Janousky[6]; Arcadi
v. The King[7], my
view is that, when Parliament used the expression “any other court of appeal in
a like case,” it must be taken to have referred to a court of appeal
adjudicating in criminal proceedings or upon criminal matters. Section 1025  is
in the Criminal Code ; and general language of that kind must be presumed to
refer to the subject-matter of the statute where the section is to be found.

For those reasons, I hold that the judgment of this court in Electric
Motor & Machinery Co. v. The Bank of Montreal5 is not a
judgment of another court of appeal in a like case with that of the judgment
sought to be appealed from.

I may say further that, even assuming the other points in favour
of the appellants, I do not understand the judgment of the Court of Appeal to
be in conflict with the judgment of this Court in the Electric Motor case5.
The latter judgment, as already stated, decided that, in order to be offences
under subss. (q) and (r) of s. 191, the acts must have been
committed by the debtor after he has been adjudged bankrupt. In the present
case, the Court of Appeal also expresses the same view in respect to another
subsec-

[Page 614]

tion of section 191, to wit: subsection (p). Then,
however, Middleton, J.A., delivering the written judgment of the Court of
Appeal, points out:

The Supreme Court of Canada, in its judgment, did not
attempt to discriminate between the date of the presentation of the bankruptcy
petition and the date when the person was adjudicated bankrupt, nor was the
effect of section 4 (11) considered and that decision cannot be regarded as
having any direct bearing upon the present case.

In the Electric Motor case[8], that
point did not come up, for the false statements complained of had been made and
submitted to the creditors long before the date of the presentation of the
petition, in fact, several months before and at a time when it might even have
been a question whether the debtor was then insolvent. The neat point which the
Court of Appeal had to decide in the present case was not present in the other
case. So that the two judgments did not turn on the same question.

The application for leave to appeal will, therefore, be
dismissed.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Bankruptcy—Concealing or
removing property of bankrupt—Offences enacted by section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act, R.S.C. [1927] c. 11—Persons other than bankrupt convicted—Conviction
valid—Criminal Code R.S.C. [1927], c. 36, s. 69—Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
[1927], c. 1, s. 28.

The appellants, one being the manager and the
other an employee of a bankrupt company, were convicted for having concealed and
fraudulently removed goods belonging to the bankrupt, contrary to section 191
(d and e) of the Bankruptcy Act. The ground of appeal was that no other
person than the bankrupt could be indicted for any offence under that section.

Held, affirming
that conviction, that the offences created by section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act were offences within section 69  of the Criminal Code ; or, to put
it alternatively, by force of section 69 , or, by force of the enactments of
section 28 of the Interpretation Act, section

[Page 27]

69 is to be read as if the offences created
by section 191 were specifically named therein.—In other words, section 191
must be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal
Code  should apply to offences created by that section, as there is nothing
in the provisions of that section necessarily or reasonably implying the
exclusion of section 69  of the Criminal Code . Crocket J. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellants, on their trial before Cusson J., president of the Court of Sessions
of the Peace, on charges of having concealed and removed property of a
bankrupt, under s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act. The ground of appeal, and
the material facts of the case bearing on the point dealt with by the Court are
stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal was dismissed; and the
conviction was affirmed.

Phillippe Mouette K.C. for the appellant.

Ernest Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.

Duff C.J.—This appeal raises a question as to the sufficiency of an
indictment in these terms:

Irving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en
rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe”, magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch était propriétaire, et dont le dit Irving
Simcovitch était le gérant et l’autre dit accusé était
l’employé et complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant été déclarée en
faillite, le ou vers le 7 décembre,
mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite
faillite pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils ont caché des comptés recevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant la même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à savoir; pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The sole point in controversy before this court is
a point raised by the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice St. Jacques, which is
stated in the formal judgment of the Court of King’s Bench in these words,

* * * because, according to section 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an
offence under that article.

The argument presented is substantially as
follows: Section 191 declares that any person who has been adjudged a bankrupt,
or in respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who has made
an authorized assignment

[Page 28]

under this Act, shall in each of the cases
following be guilty of an indictable offence.

Neither of the appellants falls within the
description of the classes of persons to whom, in the circumstances mentioned
in the subsections, the indictable offences created by the section are imputed
by the statute. It follows, it is said, that the appellants cannot be convicted
of such an offence.

The validity of this contention turns upon the
proper answer to the question whether the offences created by section 191 are
offences within section 69  of the Criminal Code ; or, to put it
alternatively, whether, by force of section 69 , or, by force of the enactments
of the Interpretation Act, section 69 is to be read as if the offences
created by section 191 were specifically named therein.

The Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c.
1, s. 28) enacts that,

Every Act shall be read and construed as if
any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described
or referred to as an indictable offence

* *
*

and all provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to indictable offences, or offences as the case may be, shall apply to every
such offence.

The language of this enactment is quite plain
and unqualified.

I have no doubt that it applies to offences
created by section 191. First of all, there is nothing in section 28 which is
(in the words of section 2) “inconsistent with the object or scope of” the Bankruptcy
Act; or, which (in the words of that section) “could give any word,
expression or clause,” in section 191, “an interpretation inconsistent with its
context.” The circumstance that the acts enumerated in section 191 are limited
to acts committed by the classes of persons described in that section is in no
way inconsistent with the proposition that the offences defined by the section
are indictable offences, as section 28 declares, or that to them, as indictable
offences, the provisions of the Criminal Code  apply. With great respect,
I cannot give my adherence to the view that in sections 191 to 201 of the Bankruptcy
Act there is sufficient evidence that these sections were intended to
constitute a code, having an operation which excludes the Criminal Code . True
it is, section 28 lays down a rule of interpretation, and necessarily,

[Page 29]

therefore, the provisions of the Criminal
Code  must give way to the enactments of the statute to be interpreted, to
the extent to which, by express words, or by necessary or reasonable
implication, such statute evinces an intention to exclude those provisions.
But, subject to this qualification, section 191  must be read and construed on
the footing that the provisions of the Criminal Code  apply to the
offences created by it, and, in particular, that the provisions of section 69
are to be construed as if such offences were specifically nominated in that
section.

Now, the effect of section 69  in this view, is
simply this: persons aiding or abetting the bankrupt or other person, whose
acts are embraced within the enactment, are guilty of the offences created by
the enactment. I see nothing here inconsistent with section 191 read by itself
alone. The bankrupt himself is not affected by this reading of the provisions
of section 69 ; as regards him, section 191 takes full and complete effect
according to its terms. On this construction of section 69 , we have a
substantive enactment, co-ordinate with section 191, by which, persons aiding,
abetting, counselling or procuring, are put upon the same plane as the
bankrupt, and become indictable and punishable for the offence in relation to
which they have so acted.

There is, therefore, nothing in the provisions
of section 191 necessarily or reasonably implying the exclusion of section 69 .

Section 201 cannot, I think, be properly read as
evidencing an intention on the part of the legislature to exclude the operation
of section 69 . It is limited to the case of offences committed by incorporated
companies, and it may well be that the framers of the Act desired to provide
against difficulties that might conceivably arise where the bankrupt is a
corporation. See King v. Daily Mirror[1].

On the other hand, I am unable to agree with the
argument advanced on behalf of the Crown, that section 198 affords an answer to
the contention of the appellants. Section 198 assumes that persons other than
the bankrupt may be guilty of an offence under the Act (for example, a creditor
or person claiming to be a creditor who has committed an offence under section
194). Section 198 does

[Page 30]

not indicate that any person other than the
classes of persons enumerated in section 191 can be guilty of an offence
created by that section.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Cannon J.—The appellants were convicted under the following indictment:

Irving Simcovitch et Harry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe”, magasin de chaussures dont
Cecilia Simcovitch était
propriétaire, et dont le dit Irving Simcovitch était le gérant et l’autre dit accusé était l’employé et
complice avant le fait, la dite compagnie ayant été déclarée en faillite, le ou
vers le 7 faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite
faillite pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils ont caché des comptes recevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant la même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à
savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The appeal to the Court of King’s Bench on the
facts and on points of law was dismissed, Mr. Justice St-Jacques dissenting on
a point of law which is now submitted to our consideration.

According to the formal judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, the learned justice would have quashed the conviction

because, according to 191 of Bankruptcy
Act, no other than the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that
article; and because the trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot
lodge a complaint against another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence,
unless he follows the enactment of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure
was not followed.

As the second reason of the dissenting judge was
not mentioned amongst the grounds of appeal, the appellants very properly state
in their factum that they cannot now support it before this court. We,
therefore, have to decide only whether or not none but the bankrupt can be
indicted for an offence under 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.

The learned dissenting judge says in his reasons
for judgment:

La question se pose
comme suit:

Les offenses, ou les séries d’offenses, que l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite édicte, peuvent-elles être mises à la
charge d’autres personnes que du failli lui-même? Et subsidiairement, peut-on
recourir à l’article 69 de la Loi
criminelle pour compléter l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite, et par application de cet article 69  du Code criminel , mettre en
accusation d’autres personnes que le failli lui-même pour la commission de
quel-

[Page 31]

qu’une ou de quelques-unes des offenses
édictées par l’article 191 de la Loi de faillite?

Il me paraît certain que le parlement fédéral
dans l’exercice des pouvoirs que lui donne la constitution de notre pays, a
voulu, en légiférant au sujet des faillites, créer un mécanisme complet, tant
au point de vue de la procédure civile que de la procédure criminelle.

Il a défini, entre autres, dans les articles
191, 195, 198 et 201, quels sont les actes qui, sans être criminels en
eux-mêmes, le deviennent eu égard à la faillite et s’ils sont commis dans les
délais et les conditions posés par la Loi de faillite. Par exemple, si
un commerçant enlève de son établissement de commerce une certaine quantité de
marchandises pour la porter ailleurs, cet acte n’est pas en soi un crime; mais
cet enlèvement devient une offense criminelle punissable, si l’enlèvement est
fait dans les six mois qui précèdent la faillite ou après la présentation d’une
requête de faillite avec l’intention de causer du préjudice aux créanciers,
c’est-à-dire avec une intention frauduleuse.

Cette offense créée par le statut des
faillites est punissable par une amende n’excédant pas $1,000, ou un terme
d’emprisonnement n’excédant pas deux années, ou, en même temps, l’amende et
l’emprisonnement.

(L’article dit que “toute personne (any
person) qui a été déclarée en faillite” etc, sera, dans chacun des cas énumérés
à l’article, coupable d’une offense “indictable” etc.

On sait que l’expression “personne” employée
dans cette loi de faillite s’applique aussi bien aux corporations qu’aux
individus.

Et pourtant, afin de donner une sanction
efficace à la loi de faillite, le législateur a disposé dans l’article 201 que
lorsqu’une offense, prévue par la loi de faillite, a été commise par une
compagnie incorporée, chaque officier, directeur ou agent de la compagnie qui a
participé dans la commission de l’offense, sera passible de la même pénalité
que la compagnie elle-même et tout comme s’il avait commis cette offense
personnellement.

A première vue, il semblerait étrange que les
termes généraux employés dans l’article 191 eussent été trouvés insuffisants
par le législateur pour permettre d’atteindre toute personne, autre que le
failli, qui aurait commis une offense de faillite.

Je crois que l’article 191 vise le failli
lui-même et nul autre.

Si le failli a commis l’une queconque des
offenses édictées par cet article, il peut être recherché en justice criminelle
et condamné à la punition prévue par la loi.

Dans le cas actuel, Cécilia Simcovitch
déclarée en faillite et ayant refusé de signer le bilan préparé par les
syndics, il y a contre elle de fortes présomptions qu’elle n’ignorait pas les
actes frauduleux commis par son gérant, à la veille même de la faillite. Elle
aurait pu, je crois, être atteinte par les dispositions de l’article 191.

Le législateur n’a pas voulu, toutefois, que
les personnes qui ont pu participer, soit directement, soit indirectement, à la
fraude ou aux actes frauduleux que la loi de faillite punit, échappent à la
justice.

En vertu de l’article 195, la cour des
faillites peut ordonner la poursuite de telle personne pour de telles offenses.

The Crown contends that section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act created an indictable offence for any person who has been adjudged
bankrupt, or in respect of whom a receiving order has been made, in each of the
cases therein enumerated.

[Page 32]

Once this offence has been committed, the Interpretation
Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 1, s. 28) applies. It reads as follows:

Every Act (of the Parliament of Canada) shall
be read and construed as if any offence for which the offender may be:—

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred were described or
referred to as an indictable offence; and

(b) punishable
on summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and,

all
provisions of the Criminal Code relating to indictable offences, or
offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every such offence.

Therefore, says the Crown, the Bankurptcy Act
not excluding this rule of interpretation, the provisions of the Criminal
Code , including section 69 , apply to this particular offence.

The Crown further contends that the appellants,
having aided and abetted the bankrupt Cecilia Simcovitch in the commission of
this indictable offence, were liable to arrest and conviction, as they have
been in this case. Cecilia Simcovitch, the bankrupt, could have have been
prosecuted together with her brothers and could even to-day be prosecuted for
the said offence.

First of all, it must be noticed that, as
pointed out by Mr. Justice Walsh in the majority judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, the legislators provided in section 198 of the Bankruptcy Act that

where there is ground to believe that the
bankrupt or any other person has been guilty of any offence under this
Act, the Court may commit the bankrupt or such other person for trial.

This section is designed to enable the court to
commit the bankrupt or any other person for trial without the necessity of a
preliminary inquiry before a magistrate; but it does not exclude the ordinary
procedure which has been adopted in the present case. The facts show clearly
that the offence was committed with the aid of the appellants. Can they escape
punishment on the technical ground that the goods that were concealed and
carried away were not their goods, but those of their bankrupt sister?

A somewhat similar question was raised in the
case of The King v. Kehr (No. 3)[2], in
which

it was urged on behalf of defendant that
the facts did not disclose an offence by the defendant, nor a lending by the
company, of whose branch office he was in charge as manager; that the offence
declared by the Money Lenders Act being purely statutory and its
prohibition not being

[Page 33]

general as to all persons, but limited to
the class specially named therein, i.e. “money lenders,” there could be no
conviction for aiding and abetting, (with the possible exception of another
money lender); that the class limitation of the statute excluded the operation
of sec. 69  of the Criminal Code  (1906), under ss. 2 and 28 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. (1906), c. 1.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
was delivered by Meredith J., who said in part:

I am also unable to see why one who is not
a money lender, within the meaning of the Act, may not be an aider and abettor
of one who is, in an infraction of its provisions.

It does not follow, from the fact that the
person who aids in the commission of a crime is, by the Criminal Code , declared
to be a party to and guilty of the offence, that one who could not alone have
committed it, cannot be convicted. One may be physically incapable of
committing a crime and yet guilty of it, through the act of another who is
capable and whose act is the act of both; and why not equally so where there is
legal incapacity?

That which the accused did would have been
none the more harmful, none the more against the object of the enactment, if
the accused, as well as his employer, had been a money lender.

Under section 69 of the Criminal Code ,

Every one is a party to and guilty
of an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any person
to commit the offence.

This has always been given this meaning: If a
person assists another in the commission of an offence, he is responsible as
though he had committed it himself. By aiding or abetting in the commission of
an offence, he becomes a party to and guilty of an offence. He does become a
party principal and there appears to be no reason why he should not be indicted
or charged as principal under the Code.

See: Rémillard v. The King[3] and Rex v. Daily Mirror[4].

I, therefore, reach the conclusion that the
rather technical point raised before us cannot prevail in face of the
provisions which are intimately connected of the Bankruptcy Act, the Interpretation
Act and the Criminal Code . The evident intention of Parliament was
that these three statutes should complete and aid one another in order to bring
to justice those who aided or abetted a bankrupt to commit offences to defraud
his creditors.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

[Page 34]

Crocket J. (dissenting): There is no doubt that the acts, with which the
appellants were charged as offences against clauses (d) and (e)
of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, are declared to be offences by that
section only when committed by a person, who has been adjudged bankrupt or in
respect of whose estate a receiving order has been made or who has made an
authorized assignment under that Act. The learned counsel for the Crown
conceded that the conviction could not be maintained against either appellant
under that section alone, inasmuch as neither was a person answering the
specific description stated in its opening words. Seeking for other provisions
with which s. 191 might be read to extend its application to any person,
whether the bankrupt or not, he argued in the first place that s. 198 of the Bankruptcy
Act itself had this effect. This argument, however, is not admissible for
the reason pointed out in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, viz: that
the language relied upon in the latter section comprehends not only the
offences described in s. 191 but other offences described in other sections of
the Act as well, which might be committed by other persons than the bankrupt
himself.

The real, substantial contention which has been
advanced in support of the conviction is that s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act must
be read together with s. 69  of the Criminal Code  in virtue of the
provisions of s. 28 of the general Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c.
1, and that s. 69  of the Criminal Code  makes any one, who abets the bankrupt
in the commission of the offence, or who does or omits an act for the purpose
of aiding the bankrupt to commit the offence, liable to prosecution for
committing the offence described in s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act as well as the
bankrupt himself.

Singularly enough, therefore, there is no
difficulty in the interpretation of s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act itself—the
enactment which creates and defines the alleged offence of which the appellants
have been convicted. Its language is as unequivocal as any language could well
be. The difficulty is encountered in the interpretation of s. 28 of the Interpretation
Act, through which it is sought to read s. 69  of the Criminal Code  into
the Bankruptcy Act for the purpose of reaching the appellants, not as
offenders who could themselves have committed the described offence, but as

[Page 35]

offenders, who might nevertheless be convicted
of that offence as accessories.

I regret that after much anxious reflection I
find myself quite unable to adopt the view of the majority of the judges of the
Court of King’s Bench of the province of Quebec and of my brethren in this
Court, that s. 28 of the Interpretation Act brings into operation, as
regards the particular offences created by s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act, the
provisions of s. 69  of the Criminal Code , so as to render a person liable to
prosecution and punishment therefor, who could not himself be guilty of the
offence as created and defined in the particular Act.

As I read s. 28 of the Interpretation Act, it
does not purport to do any more than to enact that whenever any statute of the
Parliament of Canada creates an offence, for which any person may be prosecuted
by indictment or liable to punishment on summary conviction, all the provisions
of the Criminal Code  relating to indictable offences, or offences, as
the case may be, shall apply to such offence. This section itself
prescribes a limitation to the words “any offence” in the same way as s. 191 of
the Bankruptcy Act prescribes a limitation to the words “any person.” It
qualifies the words “any offence” by the immediate addition of the words “for
which the offender may be prosecuted by indictment” or is “punishable on
summary conviction,” as s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act qualifies the words
“any person” by the words “who has been adjudged bankrupt,” etc.

It is in my judgment only to an offence, which
has been created or defined by the particular statute, to which the designated
provisions of the Criminal Code  are intended to be applied, not to an
act, which itself has not been declared by the statute to be an offence at all,
and that offence must be one, for which the offender within the
contemplation of the particular statute may be prosecuted by indictment or is
liable to punishment on summary conviction.

Once you have an offence created by the Bankruptcy
Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, of which any person,
whether adjudged a bankrupt or not, can be guilty and for which any
person can be prosecuted by indictment or is liable to punishment on
summary conviction, then I have no doubt that s. 28 of the Interpretation
Act

[Page 36]

would operate to apply all the provisions of the
Criminal Code  relating to indictable offences, or offences, to such an
offence in the same manner and with the same effect as they would apply to all
offences defined by the Criminal Code  itself. These provisions of the Criminal
Code  would then apply to such an offence without in any manner altering the
effect of the special enactment by which the offence is created.

If, however, s. 28 of the Interpretation Act is
construed in the sense contended for by the Crown we are at once confronted by
two contradictory enactments: one—the special enactment, providing that only a
person who answers a specific description, can commit the offence, which it has
created; and the other, s. 69  of the Criminal Code , providing that
anybody, whether he answers the specific description or not, can commit it. If
no one but the bankrupt is indictable for any of the offences described in the
special enactment, when that enactment is read by itself, as the Crown
concedes, and anybody is indictable for any of them, whether he be the bankrupt
or not, if the provisions of s. 28 of the Interpretation Act and s. 69 
of the Criminal Code  are read together with it, as the Crown contends
they ought to be, it necessarily follows, not only that the intendment of the
one enactment is radically different from that of the other, but that s. 69  of
the Criminal Code  is the governing enactment. Yet s. 2 of the Interpretation
Act itself, the controlling section of that statute, clearly recognizes
that it is the intention of the particular enactment which must always prevail
in the event of there being any inconsistency or repugnance between the
particular enactment and any provision of the Interpretation Act. S. 2
reads as follows:

Every provision of this Act shall extend
and apply to every Act of the Parliament of Canada, now or hereafter passed,
except in so far as any such provision,—

(a) is inconsistent with the intent
or object of such Act; or

(b) would give to any word,
expression or clause of any such Act an interpretation inconsistent with the
context; or

(c) is in any such Act declared not
applicable thereto.

In my opinion s. 28 of the Interpretation Act
and s. 69  of the Criminal
Code  can be read into s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act only in so far as
their provisions can consistently be read with those of s. 191 . If its language
is clear and free from all ambiguity in constituting any of the acts

[Page 37]

described in its various clauses as indictable
offences only when they are committed by a person who answers the specific
description stated in its opening and governing words, and there is no other
provision in the Bankruptcy Act to the contrary, it seems to me that it must
be taken that it was not intended to incorporate in the Act any provision of
the Interpretation Act, or of the Criminal Code , which would give
to that enactment any other effect than that which its own language so clearly
connotes.

With all deference to those who have reached an
opposite conclusion, I think the ground of Mr. Justice St. Jacques’ dissent in
the Court of King’s Bench was well taken. I would adopt his judgment, allow the
appeal to this Court and quash the conviction as one which discloses no offence
against s. 191 of the Bankruptcy Act.

Hughes J.—The appellants were tried and convicted in the Sessions of the
Peace at Montreal on an indictment the material parts of which are as follows:

Irving Simcovitch et Barry Simcovitch, en la cité de Montréal, en
rapport avec la compagnie “Paris Shoe Shoppe"", magasin de chaussures dont Cecilia Simcovitch était propriétaire, et dont
le dit Irving Simcovitch était le
gérant et l’autre dit accusé était l’employé et complice avant le fait, la dite
compagnie ayant été déclarée en faillite, le ou vers le sept décembre,
mil-neuf-cent-trente-deux, ont commis les actes criminels de faillite suivants:

(d) Dans les six mois qui ont précédé
la dite faillite ou après ils ont caché une partie des biens de la dite faillite
pour une valeur au delà $50 et ils
ont caché des comptes rerevables de la dite faillite;

(e) Durant le même période de temps,
ils ont frauduleusement enlevé une partie des biens de la dite faillite pour
une valeur d’au delà $50, à
savoir: pour une valeur de $5,000.

S.R.C. Loi des faillites, c. 11, art. 191, d et e.

The accused appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, and the appeal was dismissed with costs, Mr. Justice St.
Jacques dissenting. The grounds of dissent of the learned judge are set forth
in the formal judgment of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, as follows:

The Honourable Mr. Justice St. Jacques
dissenting, because, according to 191 of Bankruptcy Act, no other than
the bankrupt can be indicted for an offence under that article; and because the
trustee, by himself or by a representative, cannot lodge a complaint against
another than the bankrupt, for a bankruptcy offence, unless he follows the
enactments of 195 and 198 of the Act; and this procedure was not followed.

The appellants concede that the second reason
for dissent of Mr. Justice St. Jacques was not mentioned in the notice of
appeal as a ground of appeal and that it cannot now be urged before this Court.

[Page 38]

In his notes Mr. Justice St. Jacques said:—

Je crois que l’article 191 vise le
failli lui-même et nul autre.

The Crown, however, submits that section 69  of
the Criminal Code  is made applicable by the Interpretation Act, R.S.C.
1927, c. 1, s. 28, which reads as follows:

28. Every Act shall be read and construed
as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment,
howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to, were described
or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on summary
conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to indictable offences, or or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to
every such offence.

I am of opinion that section 69  of the Criminal
Code  is applicable.

The appeal should be dismissed.

St. Germain J. (ad hoc): I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Poisoning—Jury
trial—Misdirections by trial judge—Evidence—Admissibility—Declarations by
deceased—Res gestae—Ante mortem—Testimony by brother of accused, an
accomplice—Warning given to jury—Illegal comments by trial judge in his charge
—Whether “substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”—New trial Section 1014
(2) Cr. C.

The appellant was tried for the murder of her
husband, convicted and sentenced to death, the indictment charging her with the
administering of poison (arsenic). The conviction was affirmed by the appellate
court, two judges dissenting. The grounds of dissent were based on
misdirections by the trial judge in his charge to the jury on the

[Page 54]

two following matters. First: the Crown
brought witnesses who testified to declarations made by the deceased, in the
presence of the accused, four or five days before his death and nearly two
weeks after the date of the alleged offence, such declarations being to the
effect that he was dying from poison given to him by the accused. Counsel for
the accused having objected to the admissibility of such evidence, the trial
judge held that it could not be admitted “as being a deposition ante mortem,”
but he allowed it “as being a declaration made by the victim in presence of the
accused.” But, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge did not restrict
himself to instruct the jury accordingly, and, treating these declarations by
the deceased as being an important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make
an analysis of same and emphasized the statement made by the deceased that he
was going to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the
latter’s declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife. Secondly: the
principal witness for the Crown was one Gédéon Bernard, brother of the accused.
At the time of the trial he was serving a sentence of five years’ imprisonment
following a verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder. He
testified that the appellant came to his house and asked him if he had any
poison, as she wanted to get rid of her husband, that she agreed to pay him
$200; that he gave her some poison; that the appellant, seeing her husband ill
but not yet dead, asked him for more poison and he gave it. At the request of
counsel for the accused, the trial judge warned the jury of the danger of
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, although it was
within their legal province so to do; but he added (translation): “* * * to
tell you to take the evidence of Gédéon Bernard as that of an accomplice, I am
bound, at the request of the defence, to tell you that he was the aider and not
the principal. To be an accomplice, it is necessary that there should be a
principal, that another should have committed the crime. If it is absolutely
desired that I say to the jurors to regard Gédéon Bernard as an accomplice in
the present case, it would be necessary that the principal should be the
accused. It is not possible to be the accomplice of one who does not exist. * *
* He is not an ordinary accomplice. If he be the accomplice, he is the brother
of the accused.”

Held that the
trial judge misdirected the jury upon each of the two grounds of appeal above
mentioned and that those material misdirections were so grave as to necessitate
a new trial, the Crown having failed to shew that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice did not occur owing to such misdirections. Section 1014
(2) Cr. C.

Held, also,
that the declarations made by the deceased that he had been poisoned by his
wife were not admissible as forming part of the res gestae. These
declarations were made at the hospital nearly two weeks after the date of the
alleged offence and four or five days before his death: therefore they were too
much separated by time and circumstance from the actual commission of the
alleged criminal act. These declarations should have been alluded to only in
connection with the attitude of the accused.

Held, further
(St. Germain J. ad hoc expressing no opinion), that the trial judge
misdirected the jury in his remarks concerning the evidence of the brother of
the accused, if considered as an accomplice. The trial judge after having set
out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence
of an accomplice,

[Page 55]

destroyed in effect by his subsequent remarks
the warning given; some jurors may have in view of those remarks considered
that the request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.

Per Duff C.J.
and Crocket J.—The observations of the trial judge fall within the description
“matters which ought not to have been submitted” to the jury for consideration
by them “in aiming at their verdict.” Makin v. A. G. for N.S.W. ([1894]
A.C. 70).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, sustaining the conviction of the
appellant, on her trial before Louis Cousineau J. and a jury, on a charge of
murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on
the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the above
head-note and in the judgments now reported. The appeal was allowed; the
conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.

Antoine Rivard K.C. and Césaire Gervais
K.C. for the appellant.

Wilfrid Lazure K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Crockett J. was
delivered by

Duff C.J.—I concur with the conclusion of my brother Hughes and of Mr.
Justice St. Germain. I agree with my brother Hughes that the learned trial
judge misdirected the jury in the matter of the evidence of Gédéon Bernard, and
that this misdirection in itself was so grave as to necessitate a new trial. I
agree, moreover, with Mr. Justice St. Germain in what he says as to the statements
alleged to have been made by the unfortunate deceased, Ludger Chapdelaine, in
the presence of the accused.

The rule as to the admissibility of statements
made in the presence of the accused is stated by Lord Atkinson in Rex v.
Christie[1] in
these words:

As to the second ground, the rule of law
undoubtedly is that a statement made in the presence of an accused person even
upon an occasion which should be expected reasonably to call for some
explanation or denial from him, is not evidence against him of the facts stated
save so far as he accepts the statement, so as to make it, in effect, his own.
If he accepts the statement in part only, then to that extent alone does it
become his statement. He may accept the statement by word or conduct, action or
demeanour, and it is the function of the jury which tries the case to determine
whether his words, actions, conduct, or demeanour at the time when a statement
was made amounts to an acceptance of it in whole or in part. * * *

[Page 56]

Of course, if at the end of the case the
presiding judge should be of opinion that no evidence has been given upon which
the jury could reasonably find that the accused had accepted the statement so
as to make it in whole or in part his own, the judge can instruct the jury to
disregard the statement entirely. It is said that, despite this direction,
grave injustice might be done to the accused, inasmuch as the jury, having once
heard the statement, could not, or would not, rid their mind of it. It is,
therefore, in the application of the rule that the difficulty arises. The
question then is this: Is it to be taken as a rule of law that such a statement
is not to be admitted in evidence until a foundation has been laid for its
admission by proof of facts from which, in the opinion of the presiding judge,
a jury might reasonably draw the inference that the •accused had so accepted
the statement as to make it in whole or in part his own, or is it to be laid
down that the prosecutor is entitled to give the statement in evidence in the
first instance, leaving it to the presiding judge, in case no such evidence as
the above mentioned should be ultimately produced, to tell the jury to
disregard the statement altogether?

In my view the former is not a rule of law,
but it is, I think, a rule which, in the interest of justice, it might be most
prudent and proper to follow as a rule of practice.

The practice indicated in the judgment of
Pickford J. in Rex v. Norton[2]
which Lord Atkinson says

* * * where workable, would be quite
unobjectionable in itself as a rule of practice, and equally effective for the
protection of the accused,

is explained by Mr. Justice Pickford in these
words:

The fact of a statement having been made in
the prisoner’s presence may be given in evidence, but not the contents, and the
question asked, what the prisoner said or did on such a statement being made.
If his answer, given either by words or conduct, be such as to be evidence from
which an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the contents of the statement may
be given and the question of admission or not in fact left to the jury; if it
be not evidence from which such an acknowledgment may be inferred, then the
contents of the statement should be excluded. To allow the contents of such
statements to be given before it is ascertained that there is evidence of their
being acknowledged to be true must be most prejudicial to the prisoner, as,
whatever directions be given to the jury, it is almost impossible for them to
dismiss such evidence entirely from their minds. It is perhaps too wide to say
that in no case can the statements be given in evidence when they are denied by
the prisoner, as it is possible that a denial may be given under such
circumstances and in such a manner as to constitute evidence from which an
acknowledgment may be inferred, but, as above stated, we think they should be
rejected unless there is some evidence of an acknowledgment of the truth. Where
they are admitted we think the following is the proper direction to be given to
the jury:—That if they come to the conclusion that the prisoner had
acknowledged the truth of the whole or any part of the facts stated they might
take the statement, or so much of it as was acknowledged to be true (but no
more), into consideration as evidence in the case generally, not because the
statement standing alone afforded any evidence of the matter contained in it,
but solely because of the prisoner’s acknowledgment of its truth; but unless
they found as a fact that there was such an acknowledgment they ought to
disregard the statement altogether.

[Page 57]

It is desirable to emphasize what Lord Atkinson
says. These observations cannot, except in so far as they relate c to the
direction to the jury, now be regarded as laying down the law, but they may
properly be regarded as outlining a practice which “where workable” is
“unobjectionable” and may prove “effective for the protection of the accused.”

To these observations it may be useful to add
the following extract from the judgment of Lord Moulton at p. 559 of the same
case[3]:

There remains the second ground, namely,
that it is evidence of a statement made in the presence of the accused, and of
his behaviour on that occasion. Now, in a civil action evidence may always be
given of any statement or communication made to the opposite party, provided it
is relevant to the issues. The same is true of any act or behaviour of the
party. The sole limitation is that the matter thus given in evidence must be
relevant. I am of opinion that, as a strict matter of law, there is no
difference in this respect between the rules of evidence in our civil and in
our criminal procedure. But there is a great difference in the practice. The
law is so much on its guard against the accused being prejudiced by evidence
which, though admissible, would probably have a prejudicial influence on the
minds of the jury which would be out of proportion to its true evidential
value, that there has grown up a practice of a very salutary nature, under
which the judge intimates to the counsel for the prosecution that he should not
press for the admission of evidence which would be open to this objection, and
such an intimation from the tribunal trying the case is usually sufficient to
prevent the evidence being pressed in all cases where the scruples of the
tribunal in this respect are reasonable * * *

* * * The evidential value of the
occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that
some one makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime
cannot in itself have any value as evidence for or against him.

It is not seriously open to dispute that the
learned trial judge’s charge was calculated to convey to the jury the belief
that they were entitled to weigh the evidential value of the statement as if
the statement were evidence of the facts stated, apart from the behaviour of
the prisoner. This was done, moreover, in a manner calculated to influence
weightily the judgment of the jury in arriving at a verdict.

I find myself quite unable to accept the
contention made on behalf of the Crown that the appeal ought to be dismissed on
the ground that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
To quote the language of the Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the
Judicial Committee in Makin v. A.G. for N.S.W.[4].

Their Lordships do not think it can
properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, where on a point

[Page 58]

material to the guilt or innocence of the
accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to
consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been
submitted to them.

The matters discussed by the learned trial
judge, already referred to, in dealing with the statements of the accused,
plainly fall within the description “matters which ought not to have been
submitted” to the jury for consideration by them “in arriving at their
verdict.” This applies also to the observations of the learned trial judge upon
the evidence of Gédéon Bernard.

It is not within the province of this court to
substitute itself for the jury in such cases.

It is, I think, desirable, since there is to be
a new trial, that something should be said as to the principle governing the
admissibility of dying declarations. Whether the conditions of admissibility
are fulfilled is a question for the judge, and it is his duty to pass upon that
question before admitting evidence of the statement alleged to have been made.

First of all, he must determine the question
whether or not the declarant at the time of the declaration entertained a
settled, hopeless expectation that he was about to die almost immediately.
Then, he must consider whether or not the statement would be evidence if the
person making it were a witness. If it would not be so, it cannot properly be
admitted as a dying declaration. Therefore, a declaration which is a mere
accusation against the accused, or a mere expression of opinion, not founded on
personal knowledge, as distinguished from a statement of fact, cannot be
received.

In Rex v. Sellers, a decision
pronounced in 1796, reported in 1828 in the third edition of Carrington’s
Supplement to the Criminal Law, it was laid down that,

Nothing can be evidence in a declaration in
articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore,
anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is
receivable, but not what he says as matter of opinion.

That this statement of the law governs the
practice to-day is evidenced by the fact, that it is found in the leading current
textbooks on criminal law, Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., p. 1930; Archbold,
Criminal Evidence, 28th ed., 392; Roscoe, Criminal Evidence, 15th ed., 31;
Wills, Evidence, 2nd ed., 197.

[Page 59]

In the section of Lord Hailsham’s edition of
Lord Halsbury’s Laws of England devoted to the criminal law (9 Hals. 452) it is
reproduced almost ipsissimis verbis. The authors of that section are Mr.
Justice Avory, Sir Archibald Bodkin and Mr. R. E. Ross.

If alleged ante mortem declarations of
Ludger Chapdelaine are tendered as such during the course of the new trial, it
will be the duty of the judge to consider and decide, before permetting
evidence of them to go before the jury, whether or not these conditions have
been satisfied.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
should be ordered.

Cannon J.—I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that the learned trial
judge erred in matters of substance with respect to the declarations of the
deceased in the hospital, in the presence of the accused, and also in his presentation
to the jury of the appellant’s position if Gédéon Bouchard’s evidence was to be
considered as that of an accomplice. But I have pondered with grave anxiety
over paragraph 2 of article 1014  of the Criminal Code  which would allow this
court to dismiss the appeal and avoid a third trial if, notwithstanding our
opinion on the above grounds, we were also of opinion that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I cannot, however, reach the
conviction, to use the language of Lord He wart, C.J. re Jones alias Wright[5], that, without these irregularities
in the trial, the jury must inevitably have reached the same verdict of
guilty against the accused.

It is impossible for us to enter into a
speculation about what the jury might, could, would or should have done, and as
we do not feel able to say that they must “inevitably” have come to the
conclusion to which they did come, in the absence of the material improperly
admitted,

the conviction must be quashed and a new trial
ordered.

Hughes J.—The appellant was tried before Mr. Justice Louis Cousineau and a
jury at Sherbrooke, Quebec, January, 1934, on the following indictment:—

A East Angus, dans le district de St. François, dame Béatrice Bernard a assassiné son mari, Ludger Chapdelaine, dans les circonstances
suivantes, savoir: en faisant prendre, le ou vers 1e 15ème jour de février 1932, au dit Ludger Chapdelaine, malicieusement
et dans le but de l’empoisonner, un poison violent, savoir de l’arsenic,
qu’elle mêla à son breuvage, lors de son repas, le tout à l’insu du dit Ludger
Chapdelaine, et

[Page 60]

ce dernier mourut le 6
mars 1932, à
Sherbrooke, dit district, des suites du dit empoisonnement, la dite dame
Béatrice Bernard commettant par là un meurtre.

The accused was convicted and sentenced to
death.

The accused appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side. The appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment, Chief
Justice Sir Mathias Tellier and Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting.

From the judgment of the Court of King’s Bench,
appeal side, the accused now appeals to this Court.

The grounds of dissent as set out in the formal
judgment of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, are as follows:

Sir Mathias Tellier et
M. le Juge St-Jacques sont dissidents, parce que, suivant eux, le verdict est
vicié par suite de la preuve illégale admise au dossier, comme celle des
déclarations du défunt Ludger Chapdelaine et par suite de la direction illégale
et injuste donnée au jury, et que, dans ces conditions, il est impossible de
dire que, sans ces illégalités, le verdict du jury aurait été le même.

The notes of the Chief Justice and those of Mr.
Justice St. Jacques both shewed that the misdirection above referred to
concerned the declarations of the deceased and also concerned the evidence, as
an accomplice, of Gédéon Bernard, a brother of the appellant.

The declarations of the deceased, both as to
admissibility and direction, may first be taken up. It is not in dispute that
the deceased, on or about February 17, 1932, felt ill about two hours after he
had eaten some tomato soup prepared by the appellant, the remains of a can
opened by the deceased the day before. At first he thought it was indigestion
and had the doctor treat him. On February 23, the patient was removed by the
doctor to St. Vincent de Paul Hospital at Sherbrooke. He died there on Sunday,
March 6, 1932.

When, at the trial, Josephine Chapdelaine
Brault, sister of the deceased, was testifying to a statement made by the
deceased in the presence of the appellant the Tuesday or Wednesday before his
death, the Crown counsel endeavoured to lay a foundation for the admission of
the evidence as an ante mortem statement. The defence counsel objected,
and the learned trial judge said:—

Je ne l’accepterai pas comme une déposition ante mortem, mais comme une déclaration
ordinaire formant partie du res gestae en présence de l’accusée.

The learned judge added:—

Je ne permets pas la preuve comme étant une
déposition ante mortem, mais
je la permets comme étant une déclaration faite par la victime en présence de
l’accusée.

[Page 61]

The witness had, before the objection, testified
that the deceased had said, in his wife’s presence: “C’est toi qui m’as
empoisonné; tu le sais.” After the learned judge’s ruling, the witness added
that the deceased had also said that the appellant would appear in court and
would be hanged for it. The witness further testified that the appellant
appeared indifferent and did not reply at all. In cross-examination the witness
said the deceased had not spoken that way previously. The witness said to the
deceased that she should not say such things, but the deceased replied: “Oui,
ma tante, c’est elle qui m’a empoisonné.” He further
said:

Je pense que je vais mourir parce que je suis empoisonné; c’est de la soupe que j’ai
mangée * * * Oui, ma tante, c’est
elle qui m’a empoisonné avec la soupe qu’elle m’a donnée.

Napoléon Brault, a cousin of the deceased,
testified that he had been at the hospital to see the deceased the Sunday
before he died and also on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death. He was
asked by the Crown counsel if the deceased had spoken in the presence of the
appellant of what had happened to him. The defence counsel objected to the
admission of the statement of the deceased as a dying declaration. The learned
trial judge then ruled:—

Je suis de votre opinion. Mais je ne la prends pas comme ça. Je la prends comme une déclaration
faite en présence de l’accusée et comme faisant partie du res gestae, et je la permets.

The witness then testified that on the Wednesday
or Thursday the accused had said in the appellant’s presence: “C’est elle qui m’a
empoisonné”. The appellant did not say anything in reply.

Elie Chapdelaine, a brother of the deceased,
testified that he had gone to the hospital five or six times to see the
deceased and that he had met the appellant there on almost every occasion. The
Crown counsel asked the witness whether the deceased, during the last days, had
spoken of his dying condition, and what he had said. The defence counsel
objected to the admissibility of the evidence as a dying declaration. The
learned trial judge then ruled as follows:

Je suis de cette opinion là. Mais je ne la prends pas comme telle. C’est la déclaration de la
victime qu’il faut interpréter et non pas l’opinion du témoin; ce n’est pas une
déclaration ante mortem, mais
ça fait partie du res gestae. Ensuite ça ne regarde pas l’opinion du témoin, ça regarde la
déclaration de la victime elle même et elle fait partie du res gestae. Je permets la preuve.

[Page 62]

The defence counsel then objected to the
admission of the evidence as part of the res gestae. On this objection
the learned trial judge ruled as follows:

Je rends toujours le même décision et pour les
mêmes raisons.

The witness then testified that the deceased
had, on the Wednesday or Thursday before his death, said, in his wife’s
presence: “Je suis empoisonné, je vais mourrir; c’est elle Béatrice qui m’a
empoisonné.” The witness was asked what attitude the appellant had taken to
this statement and replied that the appellant had smiled and, to change the
subject, had said to the witness: “Ta femme est bien?” Previously the deceased
had always told the witness that he was ill of indigestion from eating soup
which the appellant had prepared from the balance of a can opened by the
deceased the day before his first illness.

Raoul Gosselin, also a Crown witness, testified
that he was a hospital attendant. He was asked by the Crown counsel if he had
heard what the deceased had said to the appellant about his illness and about
poison. He replied that he had heard it on two occasions. The defence counsel
objected to the admission of the evidence as a dying declaration or as part of
the res gestae. The learned trial judge ruled:

L’objection est renvoyée parce que toute
déclaration ainsi faite ne serait pas prise comme déclaration ante mortem faite par la victime, mais
comme déclaration de la victime en présence de l’accusée faisant partie du res gestae.

The witness then testified that the deceased had
said in the presence of the appellant:

Tu peux sortir ma maudite hypocrite, c’est toi
qui m’a empoisonné, et tu viens ici m’en faire acroire.

The witness did not remember any reply by the
appellant. The witness added that the deceased had been delirious almost
continually for three or four days before he died. From the arrival of the
deceased at the hospital he had been delirious at times.

Dealing with the declarations of the deceased
the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:

Maintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus
importante, quoiqu’on en dise. Ce sont les déclarations de la victime à
l’hôpital. Voici un homme qui dit à tout le monde qu’il va mourir, qu’il est
empoisonné, en présence de l’accusée; elle est là, elle est là tout le temps.
Il ne dit rien les premiers jours.

* *
*

Dans les premiers jours il ne dit rien; il ne
sait pas encore; mais c’est quand il est rendu à hôpital et puis que sa maladie
augmente tout

[Page 63]

le temps qu’il parle. C’est à vous autres à
vous demander:—Est-ce que c’est en
pleine santé, se voyant disparaître tout à coup, sachant qu’il est empoisonné,
et qu’il est empoisonné, d’après sa conviction, par sa femme, croyez-vous qu’il
est bien naturel qu’il ne se soit pas tu alors? Tous les médecins de l’hôpital
disent qu’il délirait par moment; tous ceux qui l’ont vu disent qu’en les
voyant entrer il les reconnaissait. Même ceux qui disent, du côté de la
défense, qu’ils y sont allés et qu’il a jamais parlé de rien, qu’ils ont jamais
crû qu’il était empoisonné, ne disent pas qu’il délirait dans ce temps là. Il
avait toute sa connaissance et souffrait. Maintenant quel intérêt avait-il
d’affirmer, de venir dire ça? Quel intérêt aurait cette dame Brault, sa tante.
Elle a rendu un témoignage, si je pouvais me servir d’une expression connue, de
sainte femme, sans aucune malice, au contraire. Et quand le savant procureur de
la défense lui demande si l’accusée a protesté contre les accusations du mari,
elle dit:—Non, elle n’a pas
protesté; c’est moi qui ai dit:—Ne
parle donc pas comme ça.—Et elle
dit sa réponse à lui:—C’est vrai
ma tante, c’est vrai ma tante.—Il
déclare qu’elle l’a empoisonné; et puis même il demande à son ami de la sortir
et il la traite d’hypocrite. Tous ces témoignages ont été entendus. C’était le
mercredi ou le jeudi; c’était quatre ou cinq jours avant sa mort, il n’était
pas encore entré dans le coma. Alors voici des déclarations excessivement
sérieuses d’un homme, quand même ça ne serait pas une déposition ante mortem, mais qui déclare qu’il sait
qu’il va mourir. Vous aurez à vous demander: quel intérêt Ludger Chapdelaine
avait-il d’accuser sa femme, puisque la défense reconnaît qu’ils vivaient bien
et étaient heureux tous les deux. Si encore on avait prouvé une animosité;
s’ils étaient déjà séparés, détestés. S’il y a eu une preuve de faite c’a été
contre l’accusée, qu’elle n’aimait pas son mari. Toute la défense a démontré
que c’était un ménage modèle, c’est son expression, elle a démontré qu’il n’y
avait aucun conflit entre les deux.

Vous devez vous demander si un homme qui a son
bon sens,—d’après tous les
témoins,—l’infirmier a dit:—Pour moi il était absolument normal,—et les réponses qu’il a données à sa tante au
moment où elle a dit:—Ne parle pas
comme ça.—C’est vrai ma tante, ce
n’est pas une réponse d’un homme qui délire. Vous êtes obligés de vous
demander, dans vos délibérations, quel intérêt avait-il d’accuser sa femme
plutôt qu’un autre? pourquoi? Enfin il disait qu’il croyait qu’il était
empoisonné, qu’il était pour mourir.—Je vais mourir, je meurs empoisonné; sortez moi cette hypocrite; je ne
veux pas la voir; elle essaie de m’en faire accroire.— Il disait qu’il allait mourrir et de fait il est mort.

It is clear that the declarations of the
deceased above referred to were not admissible as forming part of the res
gestae. They were made at the hospital within a week or thereabouts of the
death of the deceased and consequently long after the commencement of the
illness of the deceased They were, as Lord Atkinson said, in Rex v. Christie[6], so separated by time and circumstance from
the actual commission of the alleged criminal act that they were not admissible
as part of the res gestae. The Crown contended, however, that, if not
admissible as part of the res gestae, the declarations were admissible
statements made in the

[Page 64]

presence and hearing of the accused under such
circumstances that she might reasonably have been expected to have made some
answer or done something in repudiation thereof. Gilbert v. The King[7]. Hubin v. The King[8]. The appellant, on the other hand,
contended that the statements were mere opinions and therefore inadmissible,
but, assuming that the declarations were admissible as the Crown contended, the
learned trial judge did not explain to the jury that the statements made in the
presence of the appellant, even upon an occasion which should be expected
reasonably to call for some explanation or denial from her, were not evidence
against her of the facts, if any, stated save so far as she accepted the
statements or part thereof, so as to make them or part thereof, in effect, her
own, and that the evidential value of the statements depended on her behaviour
in response thereto. The King v. Christie[9].

The Crown further contended that the
declarations were admissible as dying declarations in any event and that the
learned trial judge sufficiently charged the jury. But the learned trial judge
refused to admit them as dying declarations and, in view of the disposition
that I think must be made of this appeal on the next ground, it is not
necessary to discuss them here in that light.

We now come to the evidence of Gédéon Bernard.
This witness, at the trial, testified that he was then serving a sentence of
five years’ imprisonment at St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary following a
verdict of manslaughter on an indictment for the murder of the same deceased,
Ludger Chapdelaine. He testified that during the winter of 1932, he lived at
Bishop Crossing, seven or seven and one-half miles from East Angus where the
deceased and the appellant lived. On “Samedi gras” the latter came to his house
and asked him if he had any poison for the purpose of poisoning her husband, as
she wanted to be rid of him. She told him that she would pay him $100. He asked
$300 and she said that she would give $200. He set out for East Angus on the
evening train. On Sunday morning he returned home. On Monday he went back to
East Angus. That evening he gave her some poison which he had brought in an
envelope and which he had taken from a

[Page 65]

little bottle in his own barn. He had purchased
it for his horses. Before that the appellant had written him a letter asking
for poison but the witness had thrown it in the stove. On February 21, he
received another letter, containing one dollar, which he took home and which
his wife read. The letter was as follows: “Tu viendras à East Angus. Tu sais
pourquoi.” That evening he went to East Angus. Ludger Chapdelaine was ill. The
appellant said to the witness:

Je lui en ai donné, je pensais qu’il était
pour mourir et il n’est pas mort. Tu vas m’en donner
encore.

The deceased was complaining of sickness at the
stomach and said he was going to die. The following morning, the appellant said
to the witness: “Tu vas m’en envoyer, tu m’en enverras, j’en ai plus.” That
evening she put in his pocket an envelope addressed to her at East Angus. In
the morning when he arrived home, he put the balance of the poison from the
bottle into the letter and sent it to her. After the death he asked her twice
for the hundred dollars she had promised him. The Crown
counsel then asked the witness:

Monsieur Bernard, le
vingt-deux, lorsque vous avez répondu à sa lettre et que vous êtes allé à East Angus, qu’est-ce qui s’est passé entre
vous et elle?

To the question the defence counsel objected.
The learned trial judge ruled, “Je permets la question.” The Crown counsel then
asked the witness if he had talked with the appellant and the witness answered,

Oui, j’ai causé avec elle quand je suis allé
chez elle; j’ai causé avec elle et j’ai eu des relations avec elle une fois.
C’est ça que vous voulez savoir, je vais vous le dire.

The Crown counsel then asked if that occurred on
the trip of the 6th or on the trip of the 21st, and the witness answered that
it was on February 8. In cross-examination the witness was asked about a
statement in writing previously made by him in which he had said that his wife
had heard the appellant say that she wanted poison to get rid of her husband,
and that his wife had said to make her pay dearly, to ask two hundred dollars.
To this question, he answered: “Je peux assermenter que non.” The witness also
in cross-examination was asked the following questions and made the following
answers:

Et puis, qu’un nommé Gagné le savait lui aussi; votre homme engagé, Oliva Gagné?
Je vous demandais, Monsieur Bernard, à la prison, avant votre procès, si ce que
vous aviez dit aux détectives, les déclarations aux

[Page 66]

détectives si c’était vrai, et vous avez dit
que c’était tout de travers, que l’arsenic, vous n’en aviez pas donné à votre
sœur, que vous aviez tout donné à vos chevaux, et que Oliva Gagné savait ça?—R.
Monsieur Gagné a travaillé pour moi dans l’été.

Q. Je vous demande si vous m’avez dit ça
déjà?—R. Oui, je vous l’ai déjà dit.

Introducing and speaking of the evidence of this
witness, the learned trial judge charged the jury as follows:

Maintenant, venons en aux faits. C’est là
dessus que je dois traiter de la question du complice.

S’il n’y avait que les symptômes trouvés par
les médecins tant durant la maladie de Chapdelaine que les symptômes trouvés
après sa mort, je dirais que la Couronne n’a pas tenté de faire la preuve
complète de l’accusation portée contre l’accusée. Mais il y a d’autres preuves
et la Couronne a essayé de démontrer, a lié, par des faits antérieurs, la
maladie soufferte par Chapdelaine qui a amené sa mort.

Le principal témoin c’est Gédéon Bernard.
C’est un complice * * * Vous devez prendre le témoignage d’un complice, pour me
servir d’une expression assez connue, avec un grain de sel. Vous devez le
prendre avec beaucoup de précaution, malgré que vous ayez le droit de
considérer ce témoignage, celui du complice, sans corroboration. Vous avez
droit de le croire, mais il doit être supporté, d’après moi, pour que, dans une
accusation aussi sérieuse que celle-ci, vous deviez le prendre en considération
* * *

Dans les circonstances je ne crois pas que
vous ayez de doute que Gédéon Bernard était un complice, parce qu’il a subi son
procès sur la même offense et a été condamné à cinq ans de pénitencier, qu’il
purge à l’heure actuelle. Mais la question présente un côté assez sérieux au
point de vue des précautions que vous devez prendre, avant de prendre son
témoignage, surtout dans la présente cause. Il y a un caractère absolument
particulier qui se présente dans cette cause spécialement, qui n’est pas dans
une autre cause. Pour que Gédéon Bernard soit complice, soit l’aide de
quelqu’un qui a commis un meurtre ou un crime, il faut qu’il y ait un crime. La
défense me demande de vous dire de prendre le témoignage de Gédéon Bernard avec
beaucoup de précaution parce qu’il est complice dans la mort de Ludger
Chapdelaine; on me dit de vous demander de prendre son témoignage avec beaucoup
de précaution, parce que si on a tué par le poison, l’arsenic, Ludger
Chapdelaine, Gédéon Bernard y a participé.

Donc, pour que je vous dise de prendre le
témoignage de Gédéon Bernard comme complice, je suis obligé, à la demande de la
défense, de vous dire qu’il a été l’aide et n’a pas été le principal auteur.
Pour être le complice de quelqu’un il faut un auteur, il faut qu’un autre
commette le crime. Si on veut absolument que je dise aux jurés de reconnaître
Gédéon Bernard comme complice dans la présente cause, il faudrait que le
principal acteur soit l’accusée. Il ne peut pas être le complice de quelqu’un
qui n’existe pas. Il faut que le meurtre ait existé pour que je vous demande de
le considérer comme complice, et dans ce cas, prenez son témoignage avec
beaucoup de précaution. Mais s’il est vrai, d’après les prétentions de la
défense, qu’il n’y a pas eu de meurtre, que Ludger Chapdelaine est mort de mort
naturelle et non de mort violente par arsénic, il n’est plus le complice; c’est
un témoignage indépendant qui n’aurait aucun défaut, et que vous seriez obligés
de prendre en entier. L’un ou l’autre, ou il est le complice ou il ne l’est
pas. S’il est complice

[Page 67]

il est complice de l’accusée et le meurtre a
été commis. S’il n’est pas le complice, c’est un témoin absolument impartial et
vous devez le prendre en entier. Je ne sais pas si je m’exprime assez
clairement pour vous démontrer dans quelle position assez embarrassante au
point de vue de l’interprétation du complice vous êtes. Alors, s’il est le
complice, prenez le avec précaution. En dehors de ça je suis obligé de vous
dire: ce n’est pas un complice ordinaire, s’il est le complice, c’est le frère
de l’accusée.

Il est en preuve qu’il
n’y a jamais eu aucune animosité entre l’accusée et Gédéon Bernard; il est en
preuve qu’ils se visitaient. Ce n’était pas rien qu’un frère, c’était un ami,
et un ami très intime. C’est en preuve. On n’a pas amené dans cette cause qu’il
y avait une rancune quelconque existant entre les deux. Gédéon Bernard est
condamné à cinq ans de pénitencier; il ne peut pas être touché de nouveau sur
la même accusation. Il a été trouvé coupable et c’est fini. Quand même on découvrirait
aujourd’hui qu’il est l’acteur principal, on ne peut pas le mettre en
accusation. Quel intérêt le complice aurait-il à venir rendre témoignage? Quel
intérêt avait-il? Vous pouvez vous demander ça. La vengeance? Ca n’a pas été
prouvé. Au contraire, c’est de l’amitié qu’on vous a démontrée entre les deux.
Ils ont eu un intérêt commun, à un moment donné, au point de vue du meurtre,
mais aujourd’hui il n’y en a plus; il n’y a aucun danger pour lui de parler.
Quant aux promesses qu’il aurait pu recevoir pour rendre son témoignage, où en
est la preuve? Aucune * * * vous
devez vous demander toutes ces questions. C’est en analysant toutes les
attitudes de Gédéon Bernard depuis le commencement jusqu’à aujourd’hui que vous
aurez la véritable interprétation de son témoignage.

In Vigeant v. The King[10], a new trial was ordered by this Court
where the trial judge had omitted to instruct the jury on what was an
accomplice in law and to warn them of the danger of convicting on the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice although it was within their legal
province so to do. This rule applies whether there is or is not corroborative
evidence of the testimony of the accomplice. Boulianne v. The King[11]. In the case at bar the learned trial
judge appeared to have set out to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on
the uncorroborated evidence of Gédéon Bernard, but he destroyed, in effect, by
the subsequent remarks, particularly those beginning with the words “Mais la
question * * *” and ending with the words “* * * de l’accusée,” the warning
given. Some jurors may have, in view of those remarks, considered that the
request of the defence was tantamount to an admission of guilt.

But the Crown alleges that, if there was
misdirection, in respect of the declarations of the deceased or in respect of
the evidence of Gédéon Bernard or both, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice actually occurred and that

[Page 68]

there should not be a new trial, Criminal Code ,
section 1014 (2) , particularly as there was ample other evidence of guilt. Boulianne
v. The King[12]. It is
not possible in the case at bar to say to what extent the jury or some of the
jurors were materially prejudiced against the appellant by the misdirection
concerning the evidence of Gédéon Bernard alone, but it is clear that there was
material misdirection. Allen v. The King[13]. Where the jury has been misdirected on a
material matter, the onus is upon the Crown to shew that the jury, charged as
they should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have given on the evidence
a verdict other than one of guilt. Brooks v. The King[14]. The Crown has failed to shew this.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

St-Germain J. ad hoc: Regarding the admission of the declarations made
by Ludger Chapdelaine, at the hospital, and narrated by some of the Crown
witnesses, as evidence in the case, I am of the opinion that these declarations
were rightly rejected by the learned trial judge as “dying declarations.” In
making these declarations, Chapdelaine was merely expressing the opinion that
he had been poisoned by his wife and was not asserting a statement of fact. Had
Chapdelaine been able to testify himself at the trial, such declarations would
not have been allowed. In a case of Rex v. Sellers, reported in
Carrington’s Treatises on the Criminal Law, p. 233, it was decided that:

Nothing can be evidence in a declaration in
articulo mortis that would not be so if the party were sworn. Therefore,
anything the murdered person, in articulo mortis, says as to facts, is receivable,
but not what he says as matter of opinion.

These declarations, however, though rejected as
“dying declarations,” were admitted as res gestae. Here again I must
come to the conclusion that said declarations should have also, as such, been
rejected, first, for the very same reason above mentioned as to “dying
declarations,” and, secondly, for the further reason that, having been made
several days after the date on which the appellant was accused of having given
poison to her husband, said declarations did not “constitute or accompany
and explain, the fact or transaction in issue” and therefore were

[Page 69]

not admissible “as forming parts of the res
gesta”; (Phipson, 7th Ed., p. 54).

These declarations could only have been admitted
to prove the accused’s attitude or answers and, thereby, allow the jurors to
draw their own conclusions as to such attitude and answers of the accused.
Unfortunately, the learned trial judge in his charge did not restrict himself
to instruct the jury accordingly; on the contrary, treating said declarations
as the most important part of the evidence, he proceeded to make an analysis of
same and emphasized the statement made by Ludger Chapdelaine that he was going
to die, and so to give more weight to the truthfulness of the latter’s
declarations that he had been poisoned by his wife.

Maintenant, il y a pour moi la partie la plus
importante, quoiqu’on en dise. Ce sont les déclarations de la victime à
l’hôpital. Voici un homme qui dit à tout le monde qu’il va mourir, qu’il est
empoisonné, en présence de l’accusée; * * *

Est-ce que c’est bien naturel pour un homme de
trente ans encore en pleine santé, se voyant disparaître tout à coup, sachant
qu’il est empoisonné, et qu’il est empoisonné, d’après sa conviction, par sa
femme, croyez-vous qu’il est bien naturel qu’il ne se soit pas tu alors? * * *

Maintenant quel intérêt avait-il d’affirmer,
de venir dire ça? * * *

Alors voici des déclarations excessivement
sérieuses d’un homme, quand même ça ne serait pas une déposition ante mortem, mais qui déclare qu’il sait
qu’il va mourir. Vous aurez à vous demander: Quel intérêt Ludger Chapdelaine
avait-il d’accuser sa femme, puisque la défense reconnaît qu’ils vivaient bien
et étaient heureux tous les deux * * *

Thus by his remarks the learned trial judge
invites the jurors to consider as the most important part of the evidence the
declarations of the deceased, while they should have been alluded to only in
connection with the attitude of the accused. These declarations as commented
were surely illegal evidence submitted to the jury.

Having reached that conclusion, even after the
reading of the whole evidence, in view of the decisions of Allen v. The
King[15], and Gouin
v. The King[16], I
cannot but conclude that the appeal must be allowed, the conviction quashed and
a new trial directed.

Seeing my conclusion on the first ground raised
by the appellant, I need not express any opinion with regard to the second
ground as to the comments of the learned trial judge concerning the accomplice.

Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Formal
judgment of appellate court—Mere mention of dissenting opinion—Not specifying
grounds of dissent—Section 1023 Cr. C.—Subsection 6 of section 1013 Cr. C.—21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14.

The appellant was convicted under subsection
(a) of s. 415 Cr. C. Upon
appeal, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court, the dissent of
one judge being merely mentioned in the formal judgment. Under a recent
amendment (s. 14 of c. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), subsection 6 was added to s. 1013
Cr. C. providing that, in case of a dissenting opinion, the formal judgment
should specify the grounds in . law on which such dissent was based. The Crown
contended that, owing to the failure of the appellate court so to specify the
grounds of dissent, an appeal to this Court was not open to the appellant.

Held that this
Court had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The only section of the
Criminal Code  dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023 , under which the fact
that there has been a dissent on a question of law is the sole condition for
the foundation of its jurisdiction: the circumstance that the grounds of
dissent are not specified in the formal judgment of the appellate court does
not avoid the fact of there having been a dissent, which is the only
requirement contained in section 1023  Cr. C.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by the Court of King’s
Bench, criminal side.

The appellant was convicted of the following
offence: Being president and general manager of a company called

[Page 695]

Rayon Trimmings Limited, which company had
been declared insolvent and was being wound up, he has, during the year
preceding the winding up order of the company, committed the following
indictable offence, to wit: “Acting in his capacity of president and general
manager, with intent to defraud, he did destroy, alter, mutilate and/or falsify
the books, papers, writings, valuable securities and documents belonging to the
Rayon Trimmings Limited, and/or concur in the same being done.” This is an
offence against subsection (a) of section 415  of the Criminal Code . The
accused had also been found guilty of an offence under section 417  of the
Criminal Code , but his appeal was unanimously allowed on this last conviction
by the appellate court. The Crown contended that the appeal to this Court
should be dismissed, because the judgment of the appellate court was not
rendered in accordance with section 1013  of the Criminal Code  as amended. In
1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14, subsection (6) was added to 1013 of the
Criminal Code  reading as follows: “Whenever an appeal under this section is
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and any judge of such Court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Court, the formal judgment of the
Court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.”

The formal judgment of the appellate court
did not specify the grounds in law on which the Honourable Judge Howard was
dissenting: it merely stated that Howard J. was dissenting.

On the appeal to this Court, it was held that
the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant’s
appeal. On the merits of the appeal this Court held that there was evidence on
which it could well be found that the appellant was guilty.

Lucien Gendron K.C. and Moses Doctor for
the appellant.

Gérald Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment follows:

The Court:—The appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of section
415  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 696]

Upon appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the
majority of the Court of King’s Bench, but Mr. Justice Howard dissented. In the
formal judgment of the Court, the dissent is merely referred to as follows:

This is the judgment of this Court, Mr. Justice
Howard dissenting.

Under a recent amendment (sec. 14 of s. 28 of
21-22 Geo. V), the following subsection was added to section 1013  of the
Criminal Code :

(6) Whenever an appeal under this section
is dismissed by the Court of Appeal and any judge of such court expresses an
opinion dissenting from the judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the
court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based
either in whole or in part.

In this case, the formal judgment does not
specify the grounds on which the dissent of Mr. Justice Howard is based, and
the Attorney-General, invoking former judgments of this Court (Davis v. The
King)[1]; Gouin
v. The King[2], and De
Bortoliv. The King[3]),
contends that, owing to the failure so to specify the grounds of dissent, an
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.

We are of opinion that such contention cannot be
up-held. The only section of the Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023. It gives to

any person convicted of any indictable
offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section
1013  (the right of appealing) against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The fact that there has been dissent on a
question of law is therefore the only requirement.

In the Davis case1 and in
the others referred to by the Crown, upon the state of the law as it then was,
no dissenting judgment could be legally pronounced, unless the court of appeal
directed to the contrary, and unless the direction was plainly “evidenced by
the order of the Court” (Gouin v. The King[4]); and this Court held that dissenting
opinions expressed contrary to the prohibition of the statute should be treated
as non-existent—the consequence being that there was to be found, in the
record, no dissent as a result of which the right of appeal could operate under
section 1023 of the Code.

ON APEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA

Criminal law—Murder—Jury—Proper instructions as to
circumstantial evidence—Prospective jurors—Examination on voir dire—Not given
under oath—Mention by the trial judge as to the possibility of executive clemency.

[Page 688]

The appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to be
hanged. Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed, McGillivray J. dissenting. The
questions of law upon which the latter based his dissent are: (1) That the
trial judge failed to give to the jury a proper direction with respect to the
law relating to circumstantial evidence; (2) that his ruling with respect to
the questions permitted to be asked of the prospective jurors on their
examination on the voir dire was erroneous and that the examination was
not under oath—the alleged error was that, although the trial judge allowed the
accused to ask each juror challenged for cause, if, from what he had heard or
read, he had formed an opinion on the case to be tried, he refused to allow a
further question as to the nature of that opinion—; and (3) that the direction
of the trial judge to the jury respecting the possibility of executive
intervention was, as given, insufficient.

Held that the appeal should be dismissed.

On the first point, this Court is of the opinion that the
accused had no substantial ground of complaint, taking the charge to the jury
as a whole, although the trial judge could have given a more proper direction
to the jury as to the circumstantial evidence. There is no single formula which
it is the duty of the trial judge to employ; but as a

[Page 689]

rule he would be well advised to adopt
the language, or its equivalent, of Baron Alderson, in the Hodge case (2
Lewin C.C. 227): the trial judge should instruct the jury that, in so far as
they relied upon circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the
guilt of the accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion.

On the second point, this Courts is of the opinion that the
accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the question,
which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is unnecessary to
determine; for, assuming that he had, he had suffered no prejudice by the trial
judge's refusal. As to the objection that the juror witnesses were not sworn, held
that it was the duty of the accused, as the challenging party, to see that
the witnesses he called to support the challenge were properly sworn.

On the third point, although the reference to the executive
clemency was an unfortunate one, this Court is satisfied that no harm has been
done to the accused, if the trial judge's instructions to the jury are taken as
a whole.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing his appeal by a majority
of the Court from his conviction by Ewing J. and a jury, for murder.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are
stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. and Neil Primrose for the
appellant.

J. J. Frawley for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court follows:

THE COURT:—The appellant was convicted of the murder of
Walter James Parsille, near Manville, Alberta, and sentenced to be hanged. Upon
appeal the conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta (McGillivray J. dissenting).

The questions of law upon which McGillivray J. based his dissent,
and to which we are confined in this appeal, are set out in the formal judgment
of the court as follows:

(1) That the learned trial judge failed to give to the jury
a proper direction with respect to the law relating to circumstantial evidence.

(2) That his ruling with respect to the questions permitted
to be asked of the prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire was
erroneous and that the examination was not under oath.

(3) That the direction of the learned trial judge to the
jury respecting the possibility of executive intervention was, as given,
insufficient.

[Page 690]

(1) The respect in which the learned
judge's charge is said to be insufficient as a proper direction to the jury is
that he did not instruct them that, in so far as they relied upon
circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not
only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the guilt of the
accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion. This is the rule laid down by Baron Alderson as far back as the
Hodge case[1], and it
has ever since been recognized as a proper direction to jurors.

It is of last importance, we do not doubt, where the evidence
adduced by the Crown is solely or mainly of what is commonly described as
circumstantial, that the jury should be brought to realize that they ought not
to find a verdict against the accused unless convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable explanation of the
facts established by the evidence. But there is no single exclusive formula
which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule he would be well
advised to adopt the language of Baron Alderson or its equivalent.

One most important element in the case advanced against the
appellant was the evidence of one Ward. The accused, Ward deposed, admitted to
him when they were in gaol together in Knoxville, Tennessee, that he (the
accused) and his father, having decided to rob the deceased Parsille, decided
also, in order to avoid a possible subsequent recognition of them by the
deceased, that it would be necessary to kill him. This design, according to the
statement of the accused as recounted by Ward, was carried out and the deceased
was shot by the father in the presence of the son.

The learned trial judge did not explicity tell the jury that they
ought not to convict the prisoner unless they believed the testimony of Ward,
but, on the other hand, he did not explicitly tell them that it would be open
to them to find a verdict against the accused if they disbelieved Ward. As to
this there are, first of all, these three relevant sentences:—

It may be that in the trial of a criminal charge there are
facts or sets of facts which are very suggestive but which if standing alone
would fall far short of being sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused
beyond.

[Page 691]

any reasonable doubt. But it may
also be that there are facts or sets of facts in sufficient number and of
sufficient cogency which combined may amount to proof beyond all reasonable
doubt. Such facts or sets of facts if appearing in sufficient numbers and of
sufficient force may prove beyond all reasonable doubt not only that the
accused committed the offence but that on no other reasonable hypothesis could anyone
else have committed it.

If these sentences contain a suggestion
that the jury might find a verdict of guilt without regard to Ward's testimony,
then they seem also to convey, pretty clearly, the caution that, if they should
proceed upon the circumstantial evidence alone, they must be satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion, consistent with the facts
proved, was that the accused was guilty. But the final sentence of the learned
judge's remarks on this subject is this:

You will weigh all the evidence in this case including all
these statements alleged to have been made to Ward and if you believe them to
have been made and if you believe them to be true you will say whether or not
they satisfy you beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

We think that this sentence, when read with the learned judge's
exposition of the facts and the evidence in the earlier part of his charge,
would be calculated to convey to the jury the impression that their verdict
ought to turn chiefly, if not entirely, upon their belief or disbelief of the
testimony of Ward and of the truth of the statement of fact which, according to
Ward's account, was made to him by the accused.

We are satisfied that the accused has no substantial ground of
complaint under this head.

(2) The error alleged in the judge's ruling as to the questions
which might be put to prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire
was, that, although the judge allowed the accused to ask each juror challenged
for cause, if, from what he had heard or read, he had formed an opinion on the
case to be tried, he refused to allow a further question as to the nature of
that opinion.

The accused had challenged several jurors for cause, and the
challenges were tried. In the case of three jurors the triers found against the
challenge and declared the jurors indifferent. In each such case the accused
challenged peremptorily. When the full: complement of jurors had been sworn the
accused had one peremptory challenge left, and he had a jury, every man of
which the accused, through

[Page 692]

his counsel, had expressly declared to be
unobjectionable. Notwithstanding this the accused now contends that he had a
right to put to each of these jurors the question which the learned judge disallowed,
and that, as his rights were denied him, he is entitled to a new trial.

We are fully conscious that in the administration of criminal
justice nothing is more important than that the constitution of the jury should
be free from all objection and that the accused should have the full advantage
of every safeguard which the law has provided to enable him to secure this
right, which is of the very essence of a fair trial. We, however, think that
the accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the
question, which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is
unnecessary to determine, for, assuming that he had, he has suffered no
prejudice by the judge's refusal. By his own act in peremptorily challenging
these jurors, he elected to pursue that remedy instead of having the question
of their indifference as between himself and the King determined by way of
challenge for cause. This was held in the case of Whelan v. The Queen[2]. In that case the accused desired to
challenge for cause one S., one of the jurors called. The judge ruled that he
must first exhaust his peremptory challenges. In deference to the judge's
ruling the accused challenged S. peremptorily. Afterwards, having exhausted his
twenty challenges, including S., he claimed the right to challenge peremptorily
one H. on the ground that he had been compelled to challenge S. peremptorily
and should not be obliged to count him as one of the twenty. It was held that
the trial judge was wrong in ruling that the accused must exhaust his
peremptory challenges before challenging for cause and that if S. had been
sworn there must have been a venire de novo, but it was also held that
by the peremptory challenge of S., which excluded him from the jury, the error
in the judge's ruling was nullified. As to H. the objection could not be
maintained because the accused had, in fact, twenty peremptory challenges. That
judgment was given by a very strong court and, in our opinion, the point was
rightly determined, and governs the objection now under consideration.

[Page 693]

In reference to the further objection that these juror witnesses
were not sworn, it is sufficient to point out that it was the duty of the
accused, as the challenging party, to see that the witnesses he called to
support the challenge were properly sworn.

As to the third ground of objection, the passage in question is
in these words:—

You need not concern yourselves with the penalty that is
attached to this or to any offence. It does not follow that because a man is
convicted on a capital charge that he will necessarily be hanged. It is true
that the Criminal Code  of Canada makes it incumbent upon the Court to pronounce
the sentence of death but the responsible officers of the Crown may in their
wisdom if they see fit commute that sentence. In any case that responsibility
is theirs and not yours or mine. The oath which you have taken calls upon you
to decide this case upon the evidence which you have heard from this witness
box and upon nothing else. And I need scarcely add you need have no moral fear
about doing your duty whether that duty leads you to conviction or to
acquittal.

We have no doubt that the reference to the executive clemency was
an unfortunate one. There was not the least ground for supposing that a verdict
against the accused founded on the evidence adduced and on a proper charge
would be interfered with. Such a reference could not assist the jury in
performing their duty to decide the issue of fact before them, and there is
always some risk that a suggestion that the verdict is to be reviewed may
result in some abatement of the deep sense of responsibility with which a jury
ought to be brought to regard their duty in passing upon any criminal charge,
and, preeminently, when the offence charged is murder, to which the law
attaches the capital penalty. Such observations as those addressed to the jury
by the counsel for the defence can always, if they seem likely to be harmful,
be counteracted without resorting to suggestions which may mislead the jury
into a misconstruction of their own duty.

In this case, however, we are satisfied that no harm was done.
There is, first, the immediate context of the impeached observations; which in
itself was perhaps sufficient to counteract the effect of those observations.
But, however that may be, the learned judge's observations, as a whole, were
admirably calculated to impress upon the jury a sense of the duty, with which
they were charged, to examine for themselves, and to bring to the test of their
own judgment, all the matters submitted to them; and the con

[Page 694]

text of the two sentences of which the
accused complains must, we are satisfied, have made it quite clear to the jury
that those sentences were not intended to qualify the instructions already
given to them, or to modify the impressions they must have received from what
had already been said.

The appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Evidence—Proof of
unlawful agreement—Instances when evidence is relevant—Whether irrelevant
evidence, prejudicial to accused, should be merely ruled out, or a new trial
ordered, is a matter primarily to be decided by trial judge.

On a charge of conspiracy, the agreement
itself, no doubt, is the gist of the offence; but the actual agreement need not
be proven by direct evidence. It may be gathered from several isolated doings,
having possibly little or no evidentiary value taken by themselves, but the
bearing of which one upon the other must be interpreted; and their cumulative
effect, properly estimated in the light of all surrounding circumstances, may
raise a presumption of concerted purpose entitling the jury to find the
existence of the unlawful agreement.

Admissions directly from the mouth of the
accused of a nature to elucidate the true meaning and the character of his
relations with an alleged co-conspirator constitute relevant evidence.

On a charge of conspiracy to set fire to a
building, evidence of a recent attempt on the part of the accused to induce
another person (not connected with the present charge) to commit the offence,
is relevant as tending to establish criminal intent and guilty design, if the
defence is trying to assign an innocent purpose to the acts directly charged as
establishing the conspiracy.

It is not error for a trial judge to permit
proof of acts of the alleged conspiracy to be given in evidence before the
agreement to conspire has been established, provided the latter is in fact
proved during the course of the trial.

There may be extreme cases where an
unexpected and irrelevant reference made by a witness to a statement alleged to
have been made by an accused is so prejudicial, that merely ruling out the
evidence is insufficient

[Page 166]

fully to protect the accused, and the jury
should be discharged and the prisoner tried before a fresh jury. But it is
primarily for the trial judge to decide whether such a course ought to be
followed, under the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal
will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that
decision.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the jury’s verdict of
conviction of the present appellant on his trial (before Gibsone J. and a jury)
on a charge of conspiracy to commit arson. The material facts for the purposes
of the present appeal, and the questions in issue in the appeal, are
sufficiently stated in the judgment of Rinfret J., now reported. The appeal to
this Court was dismissed.

Lucien Gendron K.C., Oscar Gagnon and
William Paradis for the appellant.

Valmore Bienvenue, K.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Rinfret J.—This case is the consequence of a fire which partly destroyed a
furniture factory at Daveluyville, in the province of Quebec, during the night
of the 29th of December, 1931.

In May, 1932, one Donat Pépin, who was night
watchman at the factory, was convicted of having wilfully set the fire.

In June of the same year, the appellant was
charged with conspiracy to commit the crime with Pépin, or with other persons
unknown. He was found guilty by the jury. He appealed to the Court of King’s
Bench, and the conviction was confirmed by a majority of the judges of that
Court, Howard J. dissenting with regard to the admissibility in evidence of
certain telegrams and of the testimony of one Bergeron. The points of dissent
alone must be considered and determined on the present appeal.

First, as to the telegrams.—

In attempting to place before the jury the facts
tending to establish the existence of the conspiracy, it was part of the
Crown’s case to prove that Pépin had been hired as night watchman at
Daveluyville, at the suggestion and through the endeavours of Paradis, in
furtherance of the plot to burn the factory.

[Page 167]

On December 21, 1931, Paradis was proven to have
written to the Victoriaville Furniture Co., owners of the factory, a letter
reading as follows:—

Paradis
& Pellerin Limitée,

Successeurs
de J. W. Paradis & Jean A. Pellerin,

J. W. Paradis, Courtier en Assurances,

Victoriaville,
Qué. ce 21 décembre
1931.

Victoriaville
Furniture Ltd.,

Victoriaville, P.Q.

Messieurs:—Attention
M. Georges Cantin.

J’ai examiné les polices
d’assurance et je considère qu’il serait mieux pour vous d’avoir un gardien de nuit et un de jour,
parce que les compagnies d’assurances croient qu’un homme ne peut pas garder
pendant 24 heures, parce que
lorsqu’il a gardé pendant 12 heures,
c’est tout ce qu’il peut faire.

Alors veuillez donc, s’il vous plaît, vous
entendre avec M. Donat Pépin, le garçon de Jules, pour qu’il puisse garder la
nuit.

J’ai parlé à M. Pépin qui est allé recevoir un
char de bois actuellement, mais il doit revenir mercredi soir, et il serait
prêt à commencer jeudi. En attendant je notifie les compagnies d’assurance que
vous avez un gardien de jour et un de nuit.

Bien à
vous,

(Signé) J. W. Paradis.

In that letter as will have been noted, Paradis stated
he had already spoken to Pépin about the suggested engagement.

The next day, December 22, the following
telegrams were alleged to have passed between Pépin and Paradis:—

Daaquam,
Qué. 22 décembre 1931.

J. W. Paradis,

Veuillez me faire remplacer par Maurice Lachance, rue St-Jean-Baptiste, d’ici
quelques jours; je serai pas Victoriaville avant vendredi, tel
qu’entendu tous les deux.

Donat
Pépin.

Victoriaville,
le 22 décembre 1931.

Monsieur Donat Pépin,

Daaquam, Co. Montmagny.

Sur quel train arriverez-vous vendredi?

J. W. Paradis.

Daaquam, 22 déc. 1931.

J. W. Paradis,

Je calcule arriver vendredi par train de nuit.

Donat
Pépin.

[Page 168]

There was ample evidence for the jury to find
that the telegrams had been actually exchanged between the parties. But the
appellant sought to discount their evidentiary value on the ground—to quote the
learned dissenting judge—that

The language of the telegrams conveys no
hint of any concealed, sinister purpose; one has to read into them what is not
there to give them any such import. And that is all the writing connected with
the accused that there is of record. No one professes to have been present when
the alleged plot was formed between Paradis and Pépin or to have overheard it or
even to have seen them together in conference before the fire.

We think the objection is untenable. Conspiracy,
like all other crimes, may be established by inference from the conduct of the
parties. No doubt the agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but
only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence.
Ordinarily the evidence must proceed by steps. The actual agreement must be
gathered from “several isolated doings”, (Kenny—“Outlines of Criminal Law”, p.
294) having possibly little or no value taken by themselves, but the bearing of
which one upon the other must be interpreted; and their cumulative effect,
properly estimated in the light of all surrounding circumstances, may raise a
presumption of concerted purpose entitling the jury to find the existence of
the unlawful agreement.

In that view, the telegrams exchanged between
Pépin and Paradis were undoubtedly receivable. Indeed, when connected with the
other facts of the case, they might well be regarded as part of the agreement
itself. At least, they formed important links in the chain of detached acts of
the parties obviously tending towards the common design and from which the
conspiracy might be inferred.

We have no doubt that, in the premises, the
telegrams were rightly admitted in evidence by the learned trial judge.

The other question raised by the dissenting
judgment refers to the legality of portions of Bergeron’s testimony with regard
to certain conversations he declared he had with the appellant on the 22nd of
December, 1931, and later with Pépin before and after the fire.

Proof of the conversation with the appellant
should not have been permitted—so it is contended—“because of its obvious
irrelevance”.

Bergeron testified that, on the 22nd of
December—and therefore barely six days before the happening of the fire—

[Page 169]

the appellant, who was then his employer, called
him to his office and offered him five hundred dollars to burn the factory. He
stated furthermore that he asked him to drive with him to Daveluyville. On
their way, to quote the words of the witness himself,

Dans l’automobile, il m’a proposé de mettre le
feu à la manufacture, même de me faire nommer gardien à la manufacture; qu’il
pouvait me faire nommer quand il
voudrait; que c’était facile pour lui; qu’il n’avait que la peine de donner une
lettre etc.

After they had reached Daveluyville, Paradis showed
him around the factory and, during the course of this visit, pointed to him a
likely convenient place to set the fire (“Ici, ce serait une très bonne place,
c’est bien sec “). He added:

Le bon temps pour faire brûler ça, c’est le
jour de Noël au soir, pendant la messe de minuit; tout le monde serait à
l’église, il y aurait personne pour remarquer le gars qui mettrait le feu.

And, as he was positively indicating his
unwillingness to act, Bergeron relates that Paradis then said:

J’aurais bien Donat Pépin pour faire la job . . . (mais) il n’est pas ici; il est rendu au diable au vert. J’ai reçu un
télégramme à matin, il ne pourra pas être ici avant le Jour de Noël après-midi
. . . Il ne sera pas là; puis,
finalement, on pourra pas le faire brûler le jour de Noël.

Thereupon, seeing that Bergeron persisted in his
refusal, Paradis is stated to have said:

Pense plus à ça. Parles-en pas même à
ta femme çà, je ne voudrais pas que personne sache çà.

We are unable to agree that the above evidence
ought not to have been received. So far as it contained admissions directly
from the mouth of the accused of a nature to elucidate the true meaning and the
character of his relations with Pépin, the evidence was clearly relevant. If,
as suggested by counsel for the appellant, it tended to show, on the part of
the accused, a previous attempt to commit a similar offence, still in our
opinion the trial judge was right in allowing it to be made in the present
case. Indeed, in our view, it was more than evidence of a similar offence; it
proved an effort by Paradis to pursue the very object of the conspiracy.

Treating the matter merely from the viewpoint of
a similar offence, the rule is that acts of the accused, though not forming
part of the incriminated transaction, are relevant, if they bear

upon the question whether the acts alleged
to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental.

[Page 170]

(Makin v. Attorney-General for New
South Wales[1]; and
see Baker v. The King[2].

It was competent to the Crown to adduce evidence
with the object of showing that the appellant had in mind the setting of the
fire to the Daveluyville factory. Bergeron’s deposition afforded proof on
Paradis’ part of a recent attempt to induce Bergeron to commit the offence
coinciding with the first steps in the conspiracy with which Paradis was
charged. To these initial steps in the alleged unlawful agreement, the defence
was trying to assign an innocent purpose. The impugned evidence was relevant as
tending to establish criminal intent and guilty design; in fact, it was
evidence of the intention to do the very thing for which he was indicted.

The other portions of Bergeron’s testimony to
which exception was taken have reference to statements of Pépin related by
Bergeron and alleged to have been made a few days before the fire, on the 26th
of December, 1931, as well as after the fire, in January and February, 1932.

In the dissenting judgment, the objection to the
admissibility of those statements is put upon exactly the same ground as the
objection in respect of the telegrams already discussed. It is said that
neither the telegrams, nor the testimony of Bergeron with regard to the
conversations with Pépin, should have been admitted “inasmuch as the Crown
failed to make by other means prima facie proof of the existence of the
alleged conspiracy.”

We have already indicated that, upon the ground
thus stated, the opinion of the learned dissenting judge cannot be upheld; for,
in our view, and quite independently of the declarations said to have been made
by Pépin, there was evidence in the record establishing prima facie that
the appellant was engaged in the unlawful conspiracy. Nor would it be error for
a trial judge to permit proof of acts of alleged conspiracy to be given in
evidence before the agreement to conspire has been established, if the latter
is in fact proved during the course of the trial. The King v. Hutchinson[3].

No further point need be discussed, for that
disposes of all the questions of law raised in the dissenting judgment

[Page 171]

which alone is the foundation of the
jurisdiction of this Court in the matter. Perhaps we may add that Pépin’s
statements to Bergeron were not received as proof against Paradis. The trial
judge so ruled and the jury was so told. But the indictment mentioned Pépin’s
name as one of the conspirators and, in this way, it was sought to establish
Pépin’s connection by evidence tending to show the actual consummation of the
crime by him. We will deal later on more fully with the statements of the 26th
of December, 1931. As for those of January and February, 1932, they do not
incriminate Paradis and in no way do they refer to him. In fact, if anything,
that part of the evidence rather leads away from him; at most, it was
unnecessary. More particularly in view of the express warning in the presiding
judge’s address, later to be referred to, we are unable to conclude that any
harm was done in the special circumstances.

Before us, however, counsel for the appellant
strongly urged that a particular statement of Pépin referring to the accused
was of such a character that the whole trial was thereby vitiated.

Although we entertain serious doubt as to
whether the point is covered by the dissenting judgment,—and our present view
would be that it is not—since we have heard counsel for and against it, we may
express the opinion that a full consideration of the able argument presented to
us would not warrant, on this point, our interference with the judgment of the
majority of the Court of King’s Bench.

The statement incriminating Paradis was made on
the 26th of December by Pépin to Bergeron, under the following circumstances:

In conformity with the telegrams exchanged on
the 22nd of December and with the interview between Pépin and Paradis, as
stated in the latter’s letter of December 21 already referred to, Pépin had
come to Victoriaville; and, on the 26th of December, he was preparing to leave
for Daveluyville to take charge of his job as night watchman. That morning, so
Bergeron testifies, he met Pépin on the street. Pépin was in Paradis’
automobile, a Hudson car, on his way to the garage, where he was to take
Paradis’ truck for the purpose of driving to Daveluyville. The truck had been
out of commission for some time; it required to

[Page 172]

be looked after; it needed chains and a new
battery. Pépin asked Bergeron to help him in this work of preparation. After
they were through, and just as Pépin was leaving, he volunteered the statement
that he was starting out for a “damned job”. Bergeron said to him he would be
better not to undertake it, to which Pépin is alleged to have made the
unexpected reply: “Oh, well! I am a bachelor and the Paradis have lots of influence”
(“Les Paradis ont de l’influence en masse”).

Objection was taken immediately. A long
discussion ensued at the conclusion of which the trial judge ruled that the
reference to Paradis should be struck from the deposition. Notwithstanding the
learned judge’s ruling, the appellant strongly contends that the reference was
so prejudicial to the accused that the jury should have been discharged and the
prisoner tried before a fresh jury.

There may be extreme cases where the suggested
procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question whether such a
course ought to be followed is primarily for the trial judge to decide upon the
circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal will always
approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that decision. In
this instance, at all events, there are clearly no adequate grounds for holding
that the learned judge ought to have acted otherwise than he did.

Bergeron’s testimony as to the preparations made
by Pépin, when leaving for Daveluyvile, in Paradis’ car, was admissible both as
tending to show Paradis’ connection with the scheme and as being evidence of
acts done by Pépin within the scope of the objects of the conspiracy with which
Paradis was identified. (Baker v. The King)[4]. It was therefore contended by the Crown
that Pépin’s remarks, made at the time of doing such acts in pursuance of the
common design, should not be regarded as mere admissions uttered by him but as
“contemporaneous comments” so related to the incidents reported by Bergeron and
so intimately connected with them as to form part of the acts themselves, the
evidence of which was properly receivable. (See Russell on Crimes, 8th ed.,
vol. I, p. 189, and the authorities therein collected.) But it is not necessary
to decide that point in this case, in view of the ruling

[Page 173]

made by the learned trial judge. We refer to it
only to indicate that the mere mention of the appellant’s name at the place
complained of in Bergeron’s testimony did not, in the circumstances, carry the
serious consequences represented to us. In the premises, the evidence objected
to was ruled out and all mention of Paradis’ name by Pépin was ordered struck
from the record. We find, moreover, that in his address to the jury the
presiding judge gave them a special direction on this point. He reminded them
of his decision that Pépin’s statements mentioning the name of Paradis were
inadmissible, that any such statements were made without right, and he warned
them that the evidence in that respect should be regarded as excluded (“Des paroles
que Pépin aurait dites, que Paradis était mêlé à l’affaire, ça, j’ai dit que ça
ne pouvait pas faire preuve contre Paradis”).

We are satisfied that the appellant has no
substantial ground of complaint in the premises.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Leave to appeal—Section 1025 Cr. С.—Application
should indicate judgments alleged to be in conflict—Rule 54 of this
court—Conviction of an insolvent for not having kept books—Whether conflicting
decisions were “in a like case” and from an “other court of appeal”—Section
417c Cr. С—Section 193 Bankruptcy Act.

When application is made under section 1025 Cr. С. for leave to
appeal in a criminal case, it is not sufficient to allege that the decision
which is intended to be appealed from “conflicts with decisions of different
courts of equal jurisdiction”; but the application, in order to comply with
rule 54 of this court, should indicate specifically the judgments of other
courts of appeal alleged to be in conflict with the decision to be appealed
from.

The appellant was an insolvent trader and had
been convicted under section 417c Cr. С. for not having kept proper books of
account. Application for leave to appeal under s. 1025 Cr.
С. was made on the ground
that, inasmuch as section 417c Cr. С. was alleged to have been virtually
abrogated by section 193 of the Bankruptcy
Act subsequently enacted, the decision of the appellate court in
affirming the conviction failed to apply the principle of law that a subsequent
statutory enactment has the effect of abrogating an anterior enactment which is inconsistent
with it; and, at the hearing, counsel for the applicant cited three judgments
which were alleged to be in conflict with the above decision.

Held that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed as the
judgments cited were not rendered “in a like case” and by an “other court of appeal”
within the provisions of section 1025 Cr. С.; besides, they were not in conflict
with the decision intended to be appealed from: the appellate court had clearly
admitted the principle of law above cited; but it had held that section 193 of
the Bankruptcy Act was not
inconsistent with the provisions of section 417c Cr.
С.

Semble that a single judge, although sitting on appeal from a conviction by
a magistrate, is not a “court of appeal” within the meaning of section 1025 Cr. С.

the decision of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,

Rinfret, J.—Les conditions exigées par l’article 1025 du code criminel pour qu’un juge de cette
cour puisse permettre l’appel sont que

le jugement dont il est interjeté appel (soit)
en apposition à celui d’une autre cour d’appel dans une cause de même nature.

La requête que l’on m’a présentée se contente d’alléguer
ce qui suit:

Whereas the decision of the said Court of
Appeal conflicts with the definition of the Criminal Code  and that of the Bankruptcy Act, which two acts are in
contradiction, and also with the decisions of different courts of equal
jurisdiction:

Je doute que cette allégation soit rédigée conformément à la règle 54 des Règles de cette cour. Dire simplement
que la décision dont on entend interjeter appel “conflicts
with the decisions of different courts of equal jurisdiction” ne me paraît guère se
conformer à la règle qui veut que “the notice of motion shall set out fully the grounds upon which it is based”; et je croirais qu’un avis de motion, pour se prévaloir de cet article,
devrait nécessairement indiquer quels sont les jugements des autres cours d’appel
avec lesquels la décision dont on se plaint est en opposition. Cependant le
savant procureur de la Couronne ne s’est pas objecté à ce que la requête me fût
présentée dans la forme où elle était; et je me bornerai donc à indiquer qu’à
mon avis cette requête n’était pas rédigée conformément aux règles de la cour.

A l’audition, de la part de l’appelant, l’on m’a
indiqué trois jugements où l’on prétendait trouver le conflit exigé par l’article
1025 pour qu’un appel pût être
permis. Ce sont les causes de Regina v. Rose[1], The King v.
Stone[2] et Rex v. Staneley[3].

L’offense dont l’appelant a été trouvé coupable est

* * * que depuis cinq
ans ou environ en la cité de Québec, dans le district de Québec, un nommé Sam Liebling, faisant affaires à Québec sous la raison
sociale “La Maison Lucille”, comme commerçant, ayant un passif de
plus de mille douars, étant incapable de payer intégralement ce qu’il doit à
ses créanciers, n’a point tenu de livres de compte qui, dans le cours ordinaire
du commerce ou du négoce qu’il a exercé, étaient nécessaires pour faire
connaître ou expliquer ses opérations, contre les dispositions de l’article 417c
du code criminel.

Le conflit, d’après ce que l’on prétend, existerait
dans le fait que le paragraphe с de l’article 417 du code
criminel

[Page 103]

constituerait une législation en matière de
faillite et qu’il aurait été implicitement abrogé par l’adoption de l’article 193 de la loi de faillite, qui, suivant le
savant procureur de l’appelant, a pour but et pour effet de pourvoir à un cas
semblable à celui qui était jusque-là couvert par le sous-paragraphe С de l’article 417. La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec, en confirmant la
conviction de Liebling, aurait donc
refusé de reconnaître le principe bien établi qu’une loi spéciale postérieure
abroge la disposition incompatible qui se trouve dans une loi générale
antérieure; Maxime qui nous vient du vieux droit romain: “Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant” (2
Inst. p. 685).

L’appelant ne saurait obtenir la permission d’appeler
à raison des jugements qu’il m’a cités.

Et d’abord, ces jugements n’ont pas été rendus dans
une cause semblable, ni par une autre cour d’appel, au sens de l’article 1025 du code criminel.

Dans Regina v. Rose[4], il s’agissait d’un habeas corpus pour obtenir l’élargissement d’un
prisonnier qui avait été trouvé coupable de “personation”,
en vertu des dispositions de The Consolidated Municipal
Act—1892 d’Ontario. La
requête a été présentée, non pas à une autre cour d’appel, mais à Boyd С. Sa décision
fut:

Where a clause in a statute prohibits a particular
act and imposes a penalty for doing it, and a subsequent clause in the same statute imposes a different
penalty for the same offence, which cannot be reconciled either as cumulative
or alternative punishment, the former clause is repealed by the latter.

Nous n’avons donc ici ni une “cause de même
nature”, ni le jugement “d’une autre cour d’appel"". En plus, comme
nous le verrons plus loin, le jugement n’est pas en opposition avec celui de la
Cour du Banc du Roi dont on se plaint.

Dans The King v. Stone[5], il s’agissait encore d’une requête pour habeas corpus présentée
à M. le juge Trenholme,

to review the decision of Extradition
Commissioner Choquet, who decided that the prisoner, Isaac Stone, alias
Schwartz, be surrendered on application by the United States Government on the
charge of having committed an offence against the bankruptcy law of the United
States, section 26b, United States Bankruptcy Act.

Si le juge Trenholme, en l’espèce, pouvait être considéré comme étant “une autre cour d’appel”
conformément aux

[Page 104]

exigences de l’article 1025,
il ne s’agissait pas, à tout événement, d’une cause
semblable; et le procureur de l’appelant a admis qu’il ne me citait cette cause
que pour signaler que le juge avait assimilé l’article 417
du code criminel à une législation en matière de faillite.

Enfin, dans Rex v. Staneły[6], il s’agissait, là encore, seulement d’une requête à un juge (Boyle J.) pour faire
annuler une conviction par un magistrat en vertu de The Government Liquor Control Act, 1924, de l’Alberta.

Ici encore, je doute fort que, par le seul fait que
le juge Boyle siégeait en appel de la
conviction prononcée par un magistrat, il pourrait être considéré comme étant
une cour d’appel teille que l’envisage l’article 1025 C.Cr. Mais je n’ai pas besoin de m’arrêter à la discussion de ce point,
puisqu’il ne s’agit pas d’une cause semblable, et surtout parce que cette
décision n’est pas en conflit avec cesile dont l’appelant veut interjeter appel.

En effet, il n’est pas exact de dire que, dans la
présente cause, la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec s’est prononcée
à l’encontre du principe bien connu qu’une législation spéciale postérieure a
pour effet d’abroger une législation antérieure sur le même sujet et avec
laquelle elle est incompatible. Au contraire, chacun des juges qui a écrit des
notes tient ce principe pour acquis et s’applique à démontrer qu’il n’y a pas
lieu de le suivre en l’espèce, parce que l’article 193 de la loi de faillite n’est pas, à son avis, incompatible avec l’article
417c du code criminel.

Voici, en effet, ce que dit M. le juge Tellier:

Comme on le voit, ledit article.
193 et ledit article 417 ne sont pas faits pour le même cas.
Ils peuvent donc exister simultanément, l’un et l’autre; et l’accusé a tort de
prétendre que ledit article 193, parce
qu’il est de date plus récente que ledit article 417, a implicitement abrogé ce
dernier.

Voici maintenant ce que dit M. le juge Rivard:

Il est vrai que l’un et l’autre article font
une contravention du défaut de tenir des livres de compte; mais ila s’arrête la similitude entre les deux
dispositions. Ce n’est pas pour si peu que, de deux lois inscrites dans les
statuts et conservés dans leur refonte, on peut dire que l’une d’elles se
trouve implicitement rappelée. Entre 193 de la Loi de faillite et 417 du code ‘criminei, il n’y
a rien d’incompatible, rien qui répugne. Ce sont deux contraventions
distinctes.

Et voici cе que dit M. le juge Galipeault:

Il s’agit donc, encore une fois, de deux
recours distincts qui ne s’excluent pas. Il serait donc oiseux de discuter, si
la Loi de Faillite étant

[Page 105]

postérieure au code criminel, et si étant une loi spéciale, alors que le code criminel est
une loi générale, si la peine prévue par l’Acte
de Faillite est moins lourde que celle portée au code criminel, il y
avait Heu de poursuivre en vertu de la Loi
de Faillite.

Bien loin de répudier le principe, comme on le
voit, chacun de ces honorables juges s’en inspire, mais fait remarquer qu’il ne
s’agit pas d’un cas où le principe s’applique et que, par conséquent, il ne
peut servir de base au jugement.

Bien entendu, l’appelant
n’a pas été capable de me citer un jugement d’une autre cour d’appel qui
décidait que l’article 193 de la Loi de faillite était
incompatible avec l’article 417c du code criminel, et que, par conséquent, le
premier devait prévaloir. Une décision dans ce sens eût fait tomber la requête
actuelle strictement dans les conditions prévues par l’article 1025 du
code criminel.

L’appelant n’avait même pas besoin de se trouver
dans une situation aussi claire. Il n’était pas nécessaire que l’arrêt ‘d’une autre cour d’appel fût dans
une cause identique, pourvu qu’il eût soulevé une question de droit analogue tranchée dans un sens différent. (The King v. Boak[7]; Barré v. The King)[8].
Mais ici non seulement il n’y a pas conflit entre les
décisions; l’on est, au contraire, en
présence de cours qui, partant du même principe général qu’elles admettent
toutes, font la distinction entre des cas où l’application
du même principe entraîne des résultats différents.

La Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec a
admis sans discussion le principe invoqué par l’appelant;
mais elle déclare dans son jugement que ce principe ne s’applique pas à la
présente cause. En décidant ainsi, le jugement qu’elle a rendu n’est
certainement pas en opposition à ceux des autres cours que l’on m’a cités, et il se conforme
exactement à la règle telle qu’elle est
exprimée dans Beale’s Cardinal Rules of Legal
Interpretation, 3rd ed., p. 525:

Every affirmative statute is a repeal by
implication of a precedent affirmative statute, so far as it is inconsistent or
repugnant thereto and no further.

J’arrive donc à la conclusion que la requête pour
permission d’appeler doit être rejetée
avec dépens.

Application dismissed
with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Club—Benevolent
Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1911, c. 19—Place "" kept for gain""—Common
gaming house—Game of cards played—Criminal Code , section 226 —The Societies Act,
R.S.B.C., 1914, c. 236.

The appellant was steward of a
bona fide club organized pursuant to the Benevolent Societies Act
(now the Societies Act) of British
 Columbia.

[Page 627]

The club had a membership of
1,700 and provided all the regular facilities of a social club, including
meals, billiard rooms, reading rooms, various card games, etc.; it also leased
and operated a football field. Members contributed ten cents apiece to the
funds of the club for each half hour's play at the poker table, irrespective of
whether they were winning or losing. This money was not taken from the stakes
or the pot, but was collected by the appellant, as steward, from the players
and paid over to the club. Only members were allowed in the premises, a by-law
expressly forbidding the introduction of visitors to any part of the club
property. The appellant was convicted, under section 226  of the Criminal Code ,
of unlawfully keeping a common gaming house; and the conviction was affirmed by
the appellate court.

Held, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal
([1932] 1 W.W.R. 154), that, upon the facts, the club was not ""a house ***
kept *** for gain "" within the meaning of section 226  Cr. C. and that the
appellant had been wrongly convicted.

R. v. Riley ( (1917) 23 B.C.R. 192 and R. v.
Cherry and Long ( (1924) 20 Alta. L.R. 400) approved; R. v.
Sullivan ( (1930) 42 B.C.R. 435) overruled.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , maintaining the conviction of the appellant of
having kept a common gaming house.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the
judgments now reported.

J. W. de B. Farris K.C.
for the appellant.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgments of Anglin C.J.C.
and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. were delivered by

ANGLIN C.J.C.—After careful
consideration of this appeal, I am satisfied that the order made by Newcombe J.
granting leave herein was providently made and that this court has jurisdiction
to entertain this appeal, on the ground of conflict between the decision of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia in it and the decision of the

[Page 628]

same court in R. v.
Riley[2]
, which, although impliedly overruled in R. v. Sullivan[3]
, had in the meantime been followed in R. v. Cherry and Long[4],
decided by the Appellate Division of Alberta in 1924. No allusion was made by
the Court of Appeal, either in the Sullivan case[5]
or in the present case, to R. v. Riley[6]
or R. v. Cherry and Long[7]
, although both were brought to the attention of the court, as appears in the report
of the Sullivan case[8] at p.
436, and here in the appeal case and factums, probably because they had to do
with payments for refreshments and were thought, on that ground, to be
distinguishable.

We might have been disposed to
hold that this case fell within clause (b) (ii) of s. 226  of the
Criminal Code , but for the fact that the evidence does not shew that

the whole or any portion of
the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such games (i.e., games of
chance, or mixed games of chance and skill) (was) either directly or indirectly
paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.

In fact, the players would appear
to have paid this money to the steward out of their own pockets rather than
from any proceeds of the game. This appears from the evidence throughout the
case. On this point we adopt the view of Beck J.A. in R. v. Cherry
and Long[9]
(at p. 407), where that learned judge says:

In my opinion, the only
reasonable interpretation of this clause ( (b) (ii) of s. 226  Cr. C.) is
that it refers, and refers only, to a payment made to the keeper out of one or
all of the ""pots"" under a rule, regulation, agreement or
understanding exacted by the keeper that such a payment shall be made as a rake-off,
commission or other form of profit to the keeper.

As to clause (a) of s. 226 , we
find it difficult to say that the "" house, room or place (was) kept ***
for gain."" No doubt, the moneys paid by the players constituted largely
the revenue of the club and belonged to its members, playing being confined to
them.

The question really presented for
our determination is whether the decision of the Appeal Court of B.C. in R. v.
Sullivan[10]
or that earlier delivered by the same court (then (1916) composed of Macdonald
C.J.A. and Martin and McPhillips JJ.A.) in Rex v. Riley[11]
appeals to us as the better.

[Page 629]

In R. v. Riley (1),
Macdonald C.J.A. said:

In Halsbury's Laws of England, vol.
4, p. 406, (par. 860), a club is defined as

A society of persons
associated together for social intercourse, for the promotion of politics,
sport, art, science or literature, or for any purposes except the
acquisition of gain.

There is no finding that the
Pender Club was not a bona fide club; there is no suggestion that the
accused conducted the house under the name of the Pender Club for personal
gain, and apart from the finding as to the "" rake-off"" it is not
suggested that the Pender Club was conducted by the members thereof for gain.
The real question involved in the submission therefore turns on whether or not
the receipt by the club of moneys for refreshments, in the manner above set
out, proves a keeping of the club premises for gain.

The rake-off was not
compulsory; that was merely the method adopted by the players of paying for
their refreshments. Instead of each one paying for his own refreshments, or
treating in turn, they took from their common store from time to time
sufficient money to pay for all the refreshments which they consumed.

*****

I think the section is aimed
at the keeping of a house for gain to which persons come by invitation, express
or implied. The members of a bona fide club come as of right. This case
is analogous to the case of Downes v.Johnson[12],
where it was held that members of a bona fide club were not to be
considered persons who resorted to the club.

and Martin J.A. said :

It cannot properly be said,
on such facts (i.e., those in the case) that the house or place in question,
conducted by the hundred (here seventeen hundred) members of the social club
all equally interested (cf. Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 4, p. 406, par.
862) was ""kept *** for gain"" within the meaning of the section and as
defined by e.g., Rex v. James[13].

That learned judge concluded his
judgment as follows:

His Worship has found that
this benevolent club is only enabled to be kept open because of the gambling
that is admittedly going on there, its revenue being otherwise very
insufficient, but the correction of such an evil is for the legislature, and in
the circumstances the courts can do nothing to stop it.

In R. v. Cherry and Long[14]
, Beck J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division of Alberta
said,

There is a company, duly
incorporated under The Companies Act as ""The Cooks and Waiters
Club."" In the memorandum of association, the objects of the company are
stated as follows:

*****

(b) To carry on a
club for the use and recreation of cooks and waiters in Edmonton.

*****

The company was incorporated
on December 7, 1923. The company undoubtedly carried on a bona fide club
*** there was provision for admitting visitors or temporary members, on the
recommendation of two

[Page 630]

members, for thirty days,
after which period, if they desired to become permanent members they had to be
voted for. Persons who were not cooks or waiters could not become permanent
members; others could become visitors for thirty days.

*****

The club kept generally a
small stock of soft drinks, coca-cola, etc., "" just ordinary refreshments
served in a club,"" but there was no restaurant in the club.*** 

There was evidence given by
the police, who watched the playing through the window on two occasions for a
very few minutes, that Cherry was seen taking, sometimes twenty-five and
sometimes fifty cents, from the ""pot,"" on several occasions; that
Cherry put this in the outside pocket of his coat. It seems to me the natural
thing that, if provision was being made for paying for refreshments, the money
should be kept by one person. Cherry was evidently selected as that person. It
is not probable that he kept his own money in the outside pocket of his coat,
so that it is to be inferred that he was keeping this refreshment money
separate, to be used as occasion arose for the purpose intended.

It was suggested during the
argument that we should infer that Cherry, who was only a visiting member, had
in some way rented or got control of the use of the particular room in which he
was, for his own purposes and profit, but such an inference from the evidence
would, to my mind, be quite unreasonable. Long was a permanent member of the
club, and was voluntarily in charge on the occasion in question for a portion
of the time during which the play was going on.

*****

The first question for
decision *** is whether the place was being conducted "" for gain.""

As to whether a place is
kept for gain, if, from the stakes, bets or other proceeds at or from the game,
money is paid to a bona fide club, in whose premises the game is being
played, in payment for refreshments supplied by the club, I adopt the decision
of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R. v. Riley[15]
, and hold that in such a case the club is not kept for gain within the meaning
of the statute.

*****

Such a payment is not made
to the keeper qua keeper, but as a seller of refreshments. Nor is the
money paid qua part of the pot, but is in reality a contribution by the
several players out of their own pockets, just as much as if they severally
contributed to the fund from their own pockets. It is paid for a purpose and
for a consideration in no way incident to the game as a game, and I think,
therefore, for the two reasons indicated, it is not the kind of payment which
is contemplated by the Act.

This view is strengthened by
two considerations: (1) The Act under consideration is criminal, and nothing is
to be found in it by intendment, but only what is clearly expressed ; and (2)
To hold otherwise would be to interfere with a harmless practice which is not
uncommon in what perhaps may be called high-class social clubs, those resorted
to by persons of divers callings, occupying the highest positions in the public
and social life of the country.

[Page 631]

The case at bar, in its facts,
seems to be clearly indistinguishable from R. v. Sullivan[16]
. For instance, here, as there, the bona fide existence of the club is
conceded, the players, who sat at the poker table for a certain period of time,
all contributed (ten cents apiece for each half hour in this case), to the
funds of the Club; no profits were or could be distributed amongst the members,
although all the property of the Club and its revenues belonged to them (The
Societies Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 236, s. 5) ; the steward collected this
money from the players and paid it over to the club; only members were allowed
in,—in fact, in the present case, by-law no. 18 expressly forbade the
introduction of visitors to any part of the club premises; the accused was
steward of the club. In all these features the case resembles R. v.
Sullivan[17]
, where the decision was based on s. 226 , 1  (a), of the Code, and the
Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the court said,

The appellant swore that he
received nothing but his salary as steward. I think, however, that s. 69  of the
Criminal Code  is applicable to the appellant, since it is apparent that the
club was a common gaming house.

From this passage and the rest of
the report, however, it would seem that the main question considered by the
court was the responsibility of the steward in the premises, rather than the
question now before us.

But, we agree with Martin J.A.,
where he said, in the case at bar,

This case cannot, in my opinion,
be distinguished in principle from our decision in R. v. Sullivan[18]
. Indeed, in some respects it is a stronger case for conviction than that ***.

Not improbably the learned judge
here referred to the fact that, in the Sullivan case[19]
, the club in question had, in addition to other features, a lunch counter
where patrons could buy meals, soft drinks, tobacco and cigars,—a feature which
was entirely lacking in the present case.

The same points made at bar in
the present case would appear to have been made in the Court of Appeal in the Sullivan
case[20] , yet
the court there held that,

The appellant, therefore,
was properly convicted of being a keeper (of a common gaming house kept for
gain within clause (a) of s. 226 ).

The present case, however, would
seem to be a fortiori a case for conviction in that here the moneys paid
by the

[Page 632]

card players constituted a chief
source of revenue of the club.

After having given to this case,
and to the cases cited at bar, the fullest consideration, we prefer the
decisions and the reasoning put forward in the Riley case[21]
and in R. v. Cherry and Long[22]
to the decision and the reasons in support thereof given in the Sullivan
case[23] . That
being so, it follows that the Sullivan case[24]
must be overruled, the appeal herein allowed and the conviction against the
appellant must be quashed.

DUFF J.—The question is whether,
on the facts disclosed in evidence, the appellant could be lawfully convicted
of keeping a common gaming house, within the meaning of section 226  of the Criminal
Code . The relevant parts of the section are as follows:

Section 226 . A common gaming
house is

(a) a house, room or
place kept by any person for gain, to which persons resort, for the purpose of
playing at any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill; or

(b) a house, room or
place kept or used for playing at any game of chance, or any mixed game of
chance and skill in which

1. ***

2. The whole or any portion
of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from such game is either directly
or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house, room or place.

The appellant was the steward of
the club, which, admittedly, was a social club, incorporated under the Benevolent
Societies Act (now the Societies Act), which owned a club house, as
well as a football ground, and provided facilities for the social intercourse
and the amusement of its members. The indoor amusements consisted of billiards,
card games, including poker.

The point in controversy concerns
the manner in which poker games were conducted, and the particular fact upon
which the Crown relies is this: every half hour a member occupying a seat at a
table and engaged in playing poker was charged a certain sum. It is true also
that the respondent, the steward, provided chips to members for which no charge
was made, a circumstance, which, so far as 'I can see, has no bearing on the
question at issue.

[Page 633]

Members only were admitted to the
premises; and it is well perhaps to emphasize the fact already mentioned that
the club was not a proprietary club, but a club incorporated under the Societies
Act. I have no hesitation in holding that there is no evidence that this
club was "" a house, room or place kept by any person for gain."" There
is not the slightest evidence to indicate that the club was not precisely what
it purported to be—a club kept for the amusement and recreation, and solely for
that purpose, of the members. Fees and other contributions made by the members
were for the purpose of defraying the expenses.

The real question seems to be
whether or not the accused can be convicted under subsection (b) 2 of
section 226 , i.e., whether or not the room in which poker was played was

a room or place kept or used
for playing therein at any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill
in which the whole or any portion of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or
from such games as either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping
such house, room or place.

It is argued by Mr. Farris that
the small fee charged for the use of the chair cannot be described as a
""gain,"" within the meaning of these words. I pass by that question
because my mind is perfectly clear upon this point, namely, that the payment of
this fee is not a payment of

the whole or any portion of
the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or from

the games. Admittedly, it is, of
course, not a payment from the bets or stakes. Is it a payment of ""the
whole or any portion "" or "" other proceeds at or from such games
""? The word "" proceeds"" here must be read in connection with
bets and stakes, and I think we are justified in saying that the word is noscitur
a sociis, and that it is limited to the proceeds of a betting or gambling
game as such, and proceeds similar in character to bets and stakes. The broader
construction would lead to consequences which it is impossible to suppose could
have been contemplated. The section is aimed, I think, at the participation by
the owner of the place where the game is carried on, in the profits or other
proceeds accruing to members from the game itself.

No doubt where it is shewn that
gain is the real object of the keeping of the place, you have a case within
subsection (a). But, as I have said, no such case is made out 

[Page 634]

here, and I think the argument
based upon subsection (b) fails also.

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction quashed.

Appeal allowed.

conviction by a jury and

[Page 197]

their sentence by the Court of King’s Bench,
criminal side, Wilson J., for the offence of speaking seditious words.

The appellants were granted special leave to
appeal to this court by Smith J., in chambers, on the ground that, at first
sight, the judgment appealed from apparently conflicted with a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of Ontario in a case of The King v. Buck[2].

On the appeal to this court, after hearing
argument of counsel, the Court delivered judgment orally, quashing the appeal
for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that such conflict did not exist.

Appeal quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Aliens—Immigration Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 93,
ss. 41, 42, 21—Complaint— Warrant—Examination by Board of Enquiry—Resolution
for deportation—Appeal to Minister—Detention—Habeas corpus—Sufficiency of
complaint—Examination of evidence.

Each of the appellants was taken into custody
under a warrant or order issued under s. 42 of the Immigration Act (R.S.C.,
1927, c. 93), pursuant to a complaint, by the Commissioner of Immigration,
expressed to foe “made under section 41 of the Immigration Act and Regulations
that (appellant) is a person other than a Canadian citizen, who advocates in
Canada the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of Canada, the
overthrow by force or violence of constituted law and authority and by word or
act creates or attempts to create riot or public disorder in Canada.” A Board
of Enquiry found each appellant guilty of the acts alleged in the complaint and
passed a resolution for his deportation. Each appellant appealed to the
Minister of Immigration and Colonization, and also, before the Minister’s
decision, applied for discharge from custody under the Liberty of the
Subject Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 231, and obtained ex parte an order nisi
in the nature of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. To
this order the Board made its return. Carroll J. refused the applications (5
M.P.R. 151), his decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en
banc (ibid), and appellants appealed to this Court.

Held: Appellants
were entitled to apply to the court. Broadly speaking, every alien who has been
admitted into and is actually in Canada and who has been taken into custody on
a charge for which he may be deported, is entitled to the benefit of the writ
of habeas corpus to test in court if his detention is according to law.

Appellants’ detention was authorized under
the Immigration Act, and their applications for release were rightly
dismissed.

The complaint was sufficient, notwithstanding
that it did not state the date when, or the particular place where, the acts
charged had been committed. All that is necessary is that it makes known with
reasonable certainty to the person against whom the investigation is directed
his alleged conduct, in violation of the Act, to which objection is taken. (Samejima
v. The King, [1932] Can. S.C.R. 640, distinguished). There is no
analogy between a complaint under the Immigration Act and an indictment
on a criminal charge (The King v. Jeu Jang How, 59 Can. S.C.R.
175, Immigration Act, ss. 33 (2), 42 (2), referred to). Moreover, the
objection of insufficiency in the complaint was not open to appellants because
(1) they did not challenge the return, which stated that the case was considered
by a Board of Enquiry 

[Page 37]

constituted under the provisions of the Immigration
Act, and, under English law, the facts stated in a return to a writ of habeas
corpus or order in lieu thereof are taken to be true until impeached; and
(2) in the proceedings before Carroll J. and the Court en banc they did
not question the regularity or sufficiency of the complaint or the warrant;
and, before this Court, they stated they were not impeaching the validity of
the warrant.

After the Board’s decision, and pending the
Minister’s decision on the appeals to him, the appellants were lawfully
detained under s. 21 of the Immigration Act.

The, court was not entitled to examine the
evidence as to its sufficiency to justify the Board’s decision (McKenzie v.
Huybers, [1929] Can. S.C.R. 38; Samejima v. The King, [1932]
Can. S.C.R. 640, referred to).

APPEALS (consolidated) from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1]
dismissing the present appellants’ appeals from the judgment of Carroll J.1
refusing the appellants’ applications, on the return of an order nisi in
the nature of habeas corpus under the provisions of the Liberty of
the Subject Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 231, to discharge them from custody.
They were kept in custody under the provisions of the Immigration Act, R.S.C.,
1927, c. 93. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the
judgment now reported. The appeals to this Court were dismissed.

L. A. Ryan and M. Garber for the appellants.

C. B. Smith K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Lamont J.—This is an appeal by Stefan Worozcyt and seven others from the
judgment of the court en banc of Nova Scotia1
affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll1 who refused the
appellants’ application for their discharge from custody. The facts briefly are
as follows:—

Each of the appellants was taken into custody by
virtue of a warrant or order issued by the Deputy Minister of Immigration and
Colonization under the provisions of section 42 of the Immigration Act (R.S.C.,
1927, ch. 93) pursuant to a complaint by the Commissioner of Immigration. The
complaint in the case of Stefan Worozcyt reads as follows:—

To the Minister of Immigration and
Colonization.

Complaint is hereby made under Section 41
of the Immigration Act and Regulations that Steve Worozcyt, Montreal, is a person
other than a

[Page 38]

Canadian citizen, who advocates in Canada
the overthrow by force or violence of the Government of Canada, the overthrow
by force or violence of constituted law and authority and by word or act
creates or attempts to create riot or public disorder in Canada.

Sgd. A. L. Joliffe,

Commissioner of
Immigration.

The complaint in the case of each of the other
appellants was to the same effect.

The warrant described the offence practically in
the terms of the complaint and directed that the person charged therein “be
taken into custody and detained for examination and an investigation of the
facts alleged in” the complaint. The examination was to be made by a Board of
Inquiry or officer acting as such.

On arrest each appellant was conveyed to the
immigration station at Halifax and there brought before a Board of Inquiry and
informed of the complaint against him. He was given the opportunity of having
counsel and three of them in fact had counsel at the hearing. Each was
separately examined by the Board of Inquiry as to the charges alleged in the
complaint and each was found guilty of the acts therein stated, and a
resolution for his deportation was passed. After the resolution had been
carried the Chairman of the Board stated to each of the appellants that he had
a right to appeal from the decision of the Board to the Minister of Immigration
and Colonization. They all appealed and the appeals are still pending before
the Minister. Section 20 of the Act provides that notice of appeal shall act as
a stay of all proceedings until a final decision is rendered by the Minister.

Instead of waiting for the decision of the
Minister, each of the appellants made an application to Mr. Justice Carrol in
Chambers for his discharge from custody under and by virtue of the provisions
of the Liberty of the Subject Act (R.S.N.S., 1923, ch. 231), and
obtained ex parte an order nisi in the nature of habeas corpus
with certiorari in aid. The order in the Worozcyt case directed that
the Board of Inquiry “do have before me or such other Judge of the Supreme
Court as may be presiding in chambers at the County Court House, Spring Garden
Road in the City of Halifax, on Monday, the 16th day of May, A.D. 1932, at the
hour of 11 o’clock * * *.”

[Page 39]

(a) the body of Stefan Worozcyt with the
cause of his detention;

(b) the warrant of the Deputy Minister,
and

(c) the depositions, minutes of evidence,
minutes of proceedings and all such other orders and proceedings had and taken
before the Board of Inquiry respecting the detention of said Stefan Worozcyt.

To this order the Board certified a return
which, inter alia, set out:—

2. That the applicant is now detained in custody
by virtue of the warrant or order of the Deputy Minister of Immigration and
Colonization under the provisions of the Immigration Act.

3. That Exhibit “A” is a true copy of the said
warrant or order.

4. That Exhibit “B” is a true copy of the
complaint upon which the warrant or order was granted.

5. That on May 2nd, 1932, the case of the said
applicant was considered by a Board of Inquiry constituted under the provisions
of the said Immigration Act, and that Exhibit “C” is a copy of the
record of the proceedings and the decision of the Board.

6. That the said applicant has appealed from the
said decision of the Board to the Minister under the provisions of section 19
of the said Act, and the Minister has not yet rendered decision in the said
appeal.

7. Pending the decision of the Minister the said
applicant is kept in custody at the Immigration Station at Halifax aforesaid
under the provisions of section 21 of the said Act.

On perusing the return made by the Board, Mr.
Justice Carroll dismissed the application of each of the appellants and his
decision was unanimously affirmed by the court en banc. The appellants
now appeal to this court.

Although the applications were made by the
appellants individually, they have been consolidated and this appeal includes
them all.

That the appellants were acting within their
rights in making their applications to the court is, I think, not open to
dispute. Broadly speaking, every alien, who has been admitted into and is
actually in Canada and who has been taken into custody on a charge for which he
may be deported,

[Page 40]

is entitled to the benefit of the writ of habeas
corpus to test in court if his detention is according to law. If it is not,
the applicant may be released. If, however, his detention is authorized by law
his application must be refused.

It is generally considered that by the law of
nations the supreme power in every state has the right to make laws for the
exclusion and expulsion of aliens and to provide the machinery by which these
laws can be effectively enforced. In the distribution of legislative powers
between the Dominion and the provinces made by the B.N.A. Act, 1867, the
exclusive legislative jurisdiction over “naturalization and aliens” was given
to the Dominion (section 91 (25)). In the exercise of the power thus given
Parliament passed the Immigration Act. The question, therefore, in this
appeal, is whether the Immigration Act authorizes the detention of the
appellants.

Section 41 of the Act provides that any person
guilty of the acts therein described (among which are those alleged against the
appellants in the complaints) shall, for the purposes of the Act, be considered
and classed as an undesirable immigrant, and that it is the duty of every
officer becoming cognizant thereof, and the duty of the officials of the
municipality wherein such person may be, to forthwith send a written complaint
thereof to the Minister, giving full particulars. Then section 42
provides:—

42. Upon receiving a complaint from any
officer, or from any clerk or secretary or other official of a municipality
against any person alleged to belong to any prohibited or undesirable class,
the Minister or the Deputy Minister may order such person to be taken into
custody and detained at an immigrant station for examination and an
investigation of the facts alleged in the said complaint to be made by a Board
of Inquiry or by an officer acting as such.

* * *
* *

3. If upon investigation of the facts such
Board of Inquiry or examining officer is satisfied that such person belongs to
any of the prohibited or undesirable classes mentioned in the two last
preceding sections of this Act, such person shall be deported forthwith,
subject, however, to such right of appeal as he may have to the Minister.

Up to the decision of the Board of Inquiry there
can be no question that the appellants were properly detained under the warrant
of the Deputy Minister provided the conditions precedent called for by the Act
had been complied with.

[Page 41]

The only grounds upon which the appellants
challenge the judgments below are:

1. That the complaint was bad in that it did not
set out full particulars of the offences alleged, that is to say it did not
state the date when, and the place where, the appellant had been guilty of the
acts charged in the complaint, and

2. That the evidence did not warrant the
findings of the Board.

The first of the above grounds is really not
open to the appellants, because,

1. They do not challenge the return, which
states that the case was considered by a Board of Inquiry constituted under the
provisions of the Immigration Act, and, under English law, the facts
stated in a return to a writ of habeas corpus or order in lieu thereof,
will be taken to be true until impeached. Short & Mellor’s Practice of the
Crown Office, 2nd ed., page 326.

2. In all the proceedings before Mr. Justice
Carroll and the court en banc, they did not question the regularity or
sufficiency of the complaint or the warrant of the Deputy Minister, and, even
on the opening of the argument before us, the leading counsel for the
appellants stated that he was not impeaching the validity of the warrant. If
the warrant is valid so also must be the complaint upon which it is founded.

Assuming, however, that the objection had been
taken before Mr. Justice Carroll and was still open to the appellants, it
cannot, in my opinion, prevail. A perusal of section 41 shews that the
particulars called for by that section can only be those in the possession of
the officer or official making the complaint. The Act does not call for an
investigation by the officer or official to ascertain the particular place
where, or the particular time when, the act alleged against the immigrant was
committed. These particulars are within the knowledge of the immigrant himself.
The very fact that the appellants did not challenge the complaint until now
shews that they understood it and did not consider they were prejudiced through
lack of particulars. In fact, until near the close of the argument before us,
the appellants’ objection to the complaint was not that it contained
insufficient particulars but that it contained a

[Page 42]

multiplicity of charges—a contention
subsequently withdrawn.

All that is necessary, in the complaint, in my
opinion, is that the allegation shall make known with reasonable certainty to
the person against whom the investigation is directed, the conduct on his part,
in violation of the Act, to which objection is taken. There is no analogy
between a complaint under the Immigration Act and an indictment on a
criminal charge. The King v. Jeu Jang How[2]. In the latter case the Crown cannot compel
the accused to go into the witness box and answer all questions put to him,
while, under the Immigration Act, the immigrant is detained “for
examination and an investigation” into the facts alleged, and he must answer
the questions put to him. (Section 33 (2) and section 42 (2).) The object of
making provision for a Board of Inquiry is to have at hand a tribunal which can
without delay inquire into the truth of the allegations made in the complaint.
In many cases the immigrant himself must necessarily be the chief witness.

It was argued that the complaint in this case
brought it within the principle of Samejima v. The King[3]. In my opinion there is no similarity
whatever: in the Samejima case3 the complaint was that Samejima “was in
Canada contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act, and had
effected entrance contrary to the provisions of section 33, subsection (7) of
the said Act.” Such a complaint did not inform the immigrant of the charge made
against him and which he had to meet; while in the case before us the complaint
sets out in clear and unambiguous language, in fact in the very words of the
statute, the acts charged against these appellants. This ground of appeal
therefore fails.

The complaint and other proceedings up to the
time the Board gave its decision being valid, there was statutory authority for
detaining the appellants under the warrant of the Deputy Minister. After the
Board gave its decision the appellants appealed to the Minister. That brought
section 21 into play. It reads:—

21. Pending the decision of the Minister,
the appellant and those dependent upon him shall be kept in custody at an
immigrant station, unless released under bond as hereinafter provided.

[Page 43]

As the Minister has not yet given his decision
the appellants are lawfully detained, as the return states, by virtue of this
section. Their applications for release were, therefore, rightly dismissed.

The second ground of appeal—that the evidence
does not warrant the finding of the Board, must also, in my opinion, be
determined against the appellants.

As a general rule in habeas corpus matters
we are not entitled to look at the evidence to see if it is sufficient to
justify the decision arrived at. In McKenzie v. Huybers[4], the appellants were imprisoned under the Collection
Act, R.S.N.S., 1923, c. 232, for fraudulently contracting a debt which
formed the subject of a judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, they “intending
at the time of the contracting of said debt not to pay the same.” The
appellants made an application to Mr. Justice Mellish for discharge from
custody. He refused their application. There was then an appeal to the court en
banc and, by special leave, to this court. In giving the judgment of this
court, Anglin, C.J., said:—

The evidence cannot be gone into for the
purpose of ascertaining whether there was anything in it to warrant the finding
of fraud.

See also Samejima v. The King[5].

Moreover, the appellants having appealed from
the decision of the Board of Inquiry to the Minister, the sufficiency of the
evidence is a matter with which the Minister can deal in the appeal but unless
he reverses the finding of the Board its decision is final.

The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Penal law—Illegal conveying of liquors—Boat confiscated and later
stolen—Revendication by the owner

APPEAL by the plaintiff appellant from the
decision of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior
Court, Bouffard J., and dismissing the appellant’s action.

The action was brought by the appellant
against the respondent to recover possession of a vessel which he alleged he
owned and which was seized at the instance of the respondent when transporting
alcohol contrary to the provisions of a provincial statute.

The trial judge held that the appellant had
not established title to the vessel, and his judgment was affirmed by the
appellate court.

On the appeal to this Court, after hearing
argument of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day
delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, holding that, if the
evidence did not establish who the real owners of the vessel were, it did
establish that the appellant was not the real owner and that, consequently, his
action must fail.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW
BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Trial—Direction to
jury as to uncorroborated evidence of accomplice—Refusal to allow opinion
evidence of ballistic expert—Competency to testify as to handwriting.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, Appeal Division, setting aside a jury’s verdict of acquittal of
appellant on a charge of murder, and ordering a new trial, was affirmed, on the
ground that

[Page 70]

the trial judge charged the jury in such a
way as to give the impression that they should not convict on the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice and, unless they found corroborative
evidence, their duty was to acquit; that this was a misdirection in law; and,
under the circumstances, probably had a material effect upon the jury’s minds.

The jury should be told that it is within
their legal province to convict, but should be warned that it is dangerous to
convict, and may be advised not to convict, on the uncorroborated evidence of
an accomplice. Rex v. Baskerville, [1916] 2 KB. 658; Rex v. Beebe, 19 Cr. App. R. 22; Gouin
v. The King, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 539, and other cases referred to.

Crocket J. took also the ground that the
trial judge erroneously refused to allow a certain ballistic expert witness to
state his opinion as to whether or not the bullet which caused the death had
been fired from the revolver produced. (Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ., while
holding that the trial judge’s ruling out was wrong, were of opinion that, in
view of later evidence from the same witness, the ruling out had not much
effect).

Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. held that the
trial judge had rightly refused to allow the evidence of a certain witness as
to certain letters being in appellant’s handwriting, as the witness’ competency
to testify in that regard had not been established; a witness may be competent
to testify as to a person’s handwriting by reason of having become familiar
with his handwriting through a regular correspondence; but in the present case
the evidence to establish competency did not shew sufficient to constitute a “regular
correspondence.”

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, setting aside the jury’s verdict of
acquittal of the present appellant on his trial (before Le Blanc J. and a jury)
on a charge of murder, and ordering a new trial. The material facts for the
purposes of the present appeal, and the questions in issue on the appeal, are
sufficiently stated in the judgment of Smith J. now reported. The appeal to
this Court was dismissed.

C. T. Richard for
the appellant.

C. D. Richards K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.
was delivered by

Smith J.—The appellant was indicted for murder and tried at Bathurst,
N.B., on the 19th August, 1932, and acquitted. The verdict of not guilty was
appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, and was set
aside on the 4th October, 1932, and a new trial ordered, on the following
grounds:

[Page 71]

1. The learned trial judge was in error in
refusing to admit in evidence certain letters written by the accused and found
undelivered in his cell.

2. The learned judge was in error in refusing to
permit the ballistic expert witness, Dr. Rosalier Fontaine, to give evidence
expressing his opinion as to the mortal bullet having been fired from the
revolver in the possession of the accused.

4. The learned judge was in error in his charge
to the jury on the question of corroboration:

(a) in instructing the jury that they
should not convict instead of warning them of the danger of convicting on the
evidence of an accomplice unless corroborated in some material particular
implicating the accused;

(b) in placing undue stress on the point
that they should not convict on the evidence of an accomplice unless
corroborated in some material particular implicating the accused; and

(c) in instructing the jury as follows:

If you have found that corroborative
evidence and believe the evidence of Wallace Pitre and if you find that he has
been corroborated in the way in which I have marked out to you, then your duty
is to convict and to find the prisoner guilty. If you find the evidence of
Wallace Pitre has not been corroborated in the way which I have marked out,
then your duty is clear to acquit him.

The appeal is from this judgment, setting aside
the acquittal on these three grounds.

The evidence excluded, which is referred to, in
the first of the grounds mentioned, was that of Audina Auber, who was called to
prove that certain letters, found in the cell of the accused, were in his
handwriting. She testified that she had known the accused for six months, and
that he had been “keeping company” with her; that he was away from home last
winter, and sent her two post cards, which she read, but did not keep. She
further testified that since the appellant had been in jail, she had received
two letters from him, brought to her by some boys, one of whom she recognized.

Relying on the receipt, in this way, by the
witness of the two post cards and the two letters, and on nothing else, the
Crown proposed to prove by her that the paper writing

[Page 72]

produced marked “M” was in the handwriting of
the appellant. This evidence was objected to, and the Court ruled, “I will not
allow that evidence at present”; and the witness stood aside. She was recalled,
at a later stage, but the Crown made no further effort to examine her as to the
appellant’s handwriting.

It is not necessary to prove handwriting by an
expert witness, but it must be established that the witness has in some way
become competent to testify as to the handwriting; and it has been laid down
that a witness may be competent by reason of having become familiar with a
person’s handwriting through a regular correspondence or through having
frequently seen the person’s handwriting. On the bare facts established here, I
do not think the learned trial judge erred in refusing to accept the witness as
one competent to testify as to the appellant’s handwriting. Two post cards and
the letters, unanswered, without any indication as to their contents, or any
circumstances brought out to indicate that the witness had reason to believe
that these two post cards and two letters were actually in the handwriting of
the accused, do not go far enough, in my opinion, to constitute a regular
correspondence within the meaning of the rule laid down by Lord Coleridge in Rex
v. O’Brien[1], as
follows:

To prove handwriting, it is necessary that
a witness should have either seen the person write, or corresponded regularly
with him, or acted upon such a correspondence. Then the witness may swear to
his belief as to the handwriting, but without one of these foundations for his
belief the question is inadmissible.

The Crown was not precluded by the ruling from
further questioning the witness to show grounds for her belief that the
documents she had received were really in the handwriting of the accused, but
simply dropped the matter.

As to the second ground quoted above, Dr.
Fontaine, a qualified expert, had examined the bullet of .38 calibre that
caused the death, and had examined also a .38 calibre revolver shown to have
been in the possession of the accused the day before the murder, and had fired
another bullet from this revolver, and then compared by a microscope and
photographs the marks left on the two bullets by the barrel of the revolver
from which they had been fired. He found seven similar marks on each bullet. He

[Page 73]

was asked, as an expert, from the experiment and
observations he had made, his opinion as to whether or not the bullet which
caused the death had been fired from the revolver mentioned. He testified that
he was in a position to give an opinion, and was finally asked:

And what would be your opinion?

The Court:
I will not allow him to express an opinion. I will shut it out.

This ruling was wrong, but it is claimed that
the effect of it is modified by what followed. The witness is next asked if the
points of similarity would indicate anything to him, and what, and he answered:

That indicates that the two bullets
compared were fired from the same revolver.

The Court:
They are indications——

A. It is an opinion, not a certitude.

The Court:
You say that positively——?

A. They might indicate——

The Court:
They are indications——?

A. They are indications——

The Court:
That the two bullets might have come from the same revolver?

A. Yes.

The Court:
And that is as far as any man can go?

A. Yes.

It is argued from this that the witness actually
gave his opinion, and that all he could say was that these two bullets, both of
.38 calibre, might have come from the same revolver. It would hardly take an
expert of Dr. Fontaine’s experience and capacity, with his microscopes and
experiments, to be able to say that two bullets of .38 calibre might have been
fired from the same revolver of .38 calibre. Under these circumstances, it can
hardly be said that the original ruling out of his opinion had much effect.

The fourth ground upon which the setting aside
of the acquittal is based is therefore the serious one.

The learned trial judge, in instructing the jury
in his charge as to what they should do with regard to the uncorroborated
evidence of the accomplice, many times gave them misdirection. At p. 159 he
says:

* * * although you may convict upon Wallace
Pitre’s evidence alone uncorroborated you should not do so. I am warning you
that Wallace Pitre being an accomplice his evidence should be corroborated by
other testimony implicating Rufus in some of the material particulars of the
offence, and I am repeating it to you because it is important and I want you to
understand it—that a jury although they may convict on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice, they ought not to do so and it

[Page 74]

is the duty of the trial judge to warn you
not to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, in this case,
Wallace Pitre is an accomplice of Rufus Pitre, and you should not convict on
his evidence alone unless you find it is corroborated in some material
particular by independent evidence implicating Rufus Pitre.

At p. 168, he says:

* * * I have explained to you how although
you may convict on his uncorroborated evidence, that you should not unless it
was corroborated by independent evidence of witnesses testifying as to
independent particulars implicating the accused.

At p. 169, he says:

If you find the evidence of Wallace Pitre
has not been corroborated in the way which I have marked out then your duty is
clear to acquit him.

Again, on the same page, he says:

* * * although you may convict on the
uncorroborated evidence of Wallace Pitre who is an accomplice, you should not
do so unless his evidence is corroborated in some material particular by
evidence implicating the accused * * *.

The rule as to what direction should be given to
a jury concerning the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice was settled in The
King v. Baskerville[2].

In the subsequent case of Rex v. Beebe[3], Lord Hewart C.J., gives in a few words the
rule laid down in the Baskerville case2, as follows:

[The jury should be told] that it is within
their legal province to convice; they are to be warned in all such cases that
it is dangerous to convict; and they may be advised not to convict.

He further points out that a direction in such a
case to the jury that they ought to convict would not be according to the law
laid down in the Baskerville case2.

These judgments have been referred to and acted
upon in a number of cases in this Court, particularly Gouin v. The
King[4]; Brunet
v. The King[5]; and Vigeant
v. The King[6].

In the Baskerville case2 Lord Reading quotes from Rex v. Everest[7], as follows:

The rule has long been established that the
judge should tell the jury to acquit the prisoner if the only evidence against
him is that of an accomplice, unless that evidence is corroborated in some
particular which goes to implicate the accused;

and, commenting on this quotation, says:

“Tell the jury to acquit” should read “Warn
the jury of the danger of convicting.”

[Page 75]

Again he says, on the same page, that the Everest
case statement quoted above goes too far in saying that the judge should
direct the jury to acquit.

In the present case, it will be seen that the
learned trial judge, in the quotations set out above, misdirected the jury in
telling them on these various occasions throughout the charge that they should
not convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice, and that it was
their duty to acquit.

In the reasons of the Court of Appeal, one of
the passages from the learned trial judge’s charge, quoted above, is set out,
as follows:

* * * a jury although they may convict on
the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, they ought not to do so and it is
the duty of the trial judge to warn you not to convict on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice;

and the following comment is made on it:

The latter sentence is correct; the former
is an error.

I am of opinion that the latter sentence is not
correct. The learned trial judge was entitled to advise the jury not to
convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, or to warn them that
it was dangerous to convict.

There was, of course, evidence before the jury
corroborating the evidence of the accomplice and implicating the accused; and
it was only in the event of the jury disbelieving or discarding such
corroborative evidence that they were called upon to make a finding upon the
uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice; and it becomes difficult to
understand why the learned judge kept impressing upon the jury so many times
their duty to acquit on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. In
addition to the fact that these repeated directions were wrong, they probably
had the effect of leading the jury to believe that the case must be disposed of
on the theory that there was no evidence corroborating the accomplice. Under
all the circumstances, the repeated misdirections of the learned trial judge
probably had a material effect upon the minds of the jury.

The appeal therefore should be dismissed.

Crocket J.—I am of opinion that the learned trial judge in his directions to
the jury regarding the corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice,
Wallace Pitre, went

[Page 76]

beyond the rule laid down in Rex v. Baskerville[8], and adopted by this Court in Gouin v.
The King[9] and Vigeant
v. The King[10]. While
he had the right, if in his discretion he deemed it wise to do so, to advise
the jury not to convict in the absence of independent evidence corroborating
the testimony of the accomplice in some material particular implicating the
accused, the effect of the several passages quoted from the judge’s charge by
my brother Smith is such that the jury might well have supposed that, no matter
how fully they may have believed in the truth of the testimony of the
accomplice, they could not convict upon it alone. The statement “If you find
the evidence of Wallace Pitre has not been corroborated in the way which I have
marked out then your duty is clear to acquit him” could leave no other
impression than that of an imperative and positive direction to acquit in the
absence of corroboration. Such a direction cannot, I think, be justified within
the rule, as now recognized in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and in
this Court, that a trial judge may in his discretion advise the jury not to
convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Whatever formula
judges may adopt in giving such advice, when they deem it proper to do so, it
ought not to be given in language which may convey to the jury the impression
that they cannot convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice if
they are convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that the testimony of the
accomplice is in fact true, and see fit thus to act upon it.

Upon this ground as well as upon the ground of
the refusal of the learned trial judge to allow Dr. Fontaine, the ballistic
expert, to state his opinion as to whether or not the mortal bullet was fired
from the revolver which was produced in court—a question to which the Crown was
entitled to have a definite answer—I think the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick was fully justified under the law, as it now stands in
this country, in setting aside the verdict of acquittal and ordering a new
trial, and for these reasons would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Jury trial—Trial
judge—Charge—Misdirection—Common fault—Annuity table—Estimate of damages—New trial—Exception to the
charge—Presence of the judge when made—Arts. 466, 467, 498, 500, 506
C.C.P.—Supreme Court Act, ss. 47,
48.

In an action for damages brought by the
appellant for injuries suffered by him as the result of a collision between his
horse-driven truck and one of respondent’s tramcars, the jury rendered a
verdict in favour of the appellant for $23,040,
the full amount claimed. But the appellate court ordered a new trial on
the ground of misdirection by the

 [Page 121]

trial judge in not
instructing the jury properly as to the application to the case of the doctrine
of common fault, and as to the use to be made of annuity tables by the jury in
arriving at the amount of the verdict.

Held that the order for a new trial pronounced by the appellate court
should not be interfered with.

Per Anglin C.J.С. and Smith J.—It is unnecessary to
decide the question whether or not the respondent was entitled as a matter of right to the order for a
new trial made by the appellate court, as the result of the trial is so
unsatisfactory that this court in the exercise of its own judicial discretion,
inherent and statutory, ought to affirm such order.

Per Duff, Rinfret and Cannon JJ.—As to the question whether counsel for
the respondent, at the trial, has “duly excepted to such misdirection” by the
trial judge in the manner provided for by article 498 C.C.P., the circumstances
of this case and the entries in the book of proceedings show that there has
been a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the code. Moreover, per Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ., this
being a matter of practice and procedure, the judgment of the appellate court
should be clearly wrong before this court ought to reverse it.

Per Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ.—The fact that no mention of a by-law of
the city of Montreal applicable to the case was made by the trial judge, in his
charge made in French, (although asked to do so), and also the manner in which
it was referred to in his charge made in English, amounted to a refusal “to
instruct (the jury) on a matter of law” (Art. 498 C.C.P.) and constituted an
additional reason for granting a new trial.

Judgment of the Court of King’s Bench (Q.R.
50 K.B. 414) aff.

APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King’s
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1],
reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., in favour of the appellant and ordering a new trial.

The appellant was conducting a horse-driven
truck out of a yard when he noticed a street car, some distance away; thinking
that he had sufficient time to cross the tracks, he continued his way, but the
tram-car struck the wagon killing one of the horses and throwing the appellant
on the pavement, causing him serious injuries. The appellant brought an action
in damages against the respondent company, and the latter alleged in its plea
that the appellant was to blame in driving his truck in front of a moving
tram-car when so close as to render the accident inevitable. The jury found the
appellant was blameless and having in no way contributed to the accident and
assessed the damages at $23,040, the full amount claimed. The trial

[Page 122]

judge rendered judgment according to the
verdict. The respondent then appealed to the Court of King’s Bench, first, on
the ground that the damages awarded were excessive, and also on grounds of
misdirection: first, as to the doctrine of common fault, and, second, as to the
use to be made of annuity tables in assessing damages. As to the question of
common fault the trial judge made the following remarks: “That question is put
to the jury because both parties might be at fault, but, as a rule, I would say
that in nine cases out of ten, there is no such a thing as a common fault;
there is generally one determining fault that causes the accident, and the
other one is not a contributing fault in the sense of the law. I might say,
with due respect to my fellow judges, that the common fault is often only an
easy way to decide a doubtful case. When it is not quite clear who is at fault,
they say: Both at fault, and let it go at that.” As to
the question of the annuity tables, the trial judge gave these directions: “D’après les tables d’assurance,
à trente ans, s’il était normal, il devrait vivre trente-cinq ans de plus. On
vit plus longtemps que cela des fois, mais il y en a qui vivent moins
longtemps; trente-cinq ans c’est la moyenne. Et à cet âge-là, pour acheter une
rente viagère de cent dollars, cela lui coûterait dix-sept cent
quatre-vingt-deux dollars ($1,782) et pour deux cents dollars ($200) le double et ainsi de suite. Si vous arrivez à la conclusion que quand
il était normal il gagnait mille dollars ($1,000) et qu’aujourd’hui il ne peut pas gagner plus, disons, que cinq cents
dollars ($500) ce sera une base
avec la table d’assurance, pour établir le montant des dommages que vous
devez accorder pour cet item-là. Ce sera un guide pour vous aider. Vous direz: il perd cinq cents dollars ($500) par année. Si pour se rattrapper il veut acheter une pension viagère, il
faudra qu’il paie cinq fois dix-sept cents quatre vingt-deux dollars ($1,782). S’il verse entre les mains d’une compagnie
d’assurance dix-sept cent quatre-vingt-deux dollars ($1,782)
la compagnie va lui payer cent dollars ($100) par année pour le reste de sa vie. Les
rentes viagères plus vous êtes jeune, plus ça coûte cher. Quand vous êtes
vieux, ça ne coûte plus bien cher. Cela n’est pas une règle absolue, c’est
seulement un moyen, une indication pour vous aider à arriver à une conclusion.”

[Page 123]

The Court of King’s Bench set aside the verdict
and ordered a new trial on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the
jury in these two important respects and substantial prejudice had thereby been
occasioned. The appellant then appealed to this court and urged as his first
ground of appeal (which was also raised before the Court of King’s Bench) that
the objections to the particular statements made by the trial judge in his
charge to the jury-were not taken at the proper time. Under the Code of Civil
Procedure (art. 498),

a new trial may be granted:

* *
*

3. When the judge has misdirected the jury or
refused to instruct them on a matter of law, and the party complaining has duly
excepted to such misdirection or refusal.

But the causes for a new trial, mentioned in
this paragraph,

can be ascertained only by means of the
minutes of trial, and when the party has caused his objections to be entered
therein.

(art. 506, C.C.P.). With regard to the minutes
of trial, the code contains the following provisions:

466. The prothonotary keeps, under the
direction of the judge, full minutes of the proceedings at the trial, including
all admissions, and all exceptions taken, or objections made, orally in court.

467. A copy of such minutes is made out by
the prothonotary, and, after being certified by the judge, is filed of record,
and is held to be the true record of all proceedings mentioned therein, and
stands in lieu of any bill of exceptions by either party against the evidence
or the trial.

What took place after the learned trial judge
had completed his address to the jury is recited thus in the minutes of trial:

Les jurés se retirent aux fins de délibérer.

* *
*

M. Vallée fait quelques exceptions à l’adresse
du juge et M. Genest y répond. Le tout est sténographié.

The material parts of the stenographic report referred
to and thereby incorporated in the minutes of the trial read as follows:

Me Genest, C.R., conseil du demandeur:

La cour voudrait-elle demander aux parties si
elles désirent que quelque chose soit ajouté à votre charge?

Le juge: C’est après que le jury sera retiré.
(Les jurés se retirent. Le juge aussi se retire.)

Exceptions à la charge du juge aux jurés.

Après la charge aux jurés, alors que le juge
et les jurés se sont retirés de la salle d’audience, Me Arthur Vallée, С.R., avocat de la
défenderesse, fait la déclaration suivante:

[Page 124]

Le procureur de la défenderesse excipe
respectueusement de la charge du juge aux jurés pour les raisons suivantes:

* *
*

Parce que le président du tribunal n’a pas
éclairé suffisamment le jury sur les dispositions du règlement 890 de la cité de Montréal, et surtout sur les
dispositions de ľarticle 64 du contrat entre la cité de Montréal et la compagnie défenderesse;

Parce qu’il a mal défini la faute commune et
mal avisé les jurés, en leur disant qu’il ne pouvait y avoir faute commune en l’occurrence,
de même qu’il les a mal avisés en référant au montant nécessaire pour payer une
annuité.

Under the above circumstances the effect of the
judgment of the Court of King’s Bench is that the manner in which the
objections were taken was a compliance with the articles of the code sufficient
to found a judgment ordering a new trial.

R. Genest K.C. and В. Robinson for the appellant.

Arthur Vallèe K.C. for the respondent.

Anglin, C.J.C.—After giving full
consideration to this case and to the arguments of counsel for the appellant
and respondent, respectively, I am of the opinion that it is not possible for
us to interfere with the order for a new trial. Having reached this conclusion,
I abstain, as is our custom, from comment on the evidence or discussion of the
facts. Without necessarily agreeing with the view of the Court of King’s Bench
that there had been sufficient compliance by counsel for the respondent company
with art. 498 (3), I think that,
in a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we should refrain from interfering
with the order pronounced by that court. The trial already had, having regard to
the manner in which the case was presented by the learned trial judge to the
jury, cannot, as a whole, be regarded as other than most unsatisfactory.

It is almost impossible to say whether the jury
was, or was not, properly instructed as to the application to the case at bar
of the doctrine of common fault. Indeed, what was said by the learned trial
judge may well have been taken by some members of the jury to amount to a
withdrawal from its consideration of that issue. Yet, there certainly is
evidence in the record of circumstances from which it might be inferred by the
jury, as a reasonable deduction, that the plaintiff was not entirely free from
fault.

Upon the other point of alleged misdirection,
viz., as to the use to be made of annuity tables by the jury in arriving

[Page 125]

at the amount of their verdict, the charge is
also unsatisfactory, because, although it may not be possible to point to any
particular statement of the learned judge, in the course of his directions in
regard to the use the jury might make of these tables, as clearly erroneous,
the charge was “out of harmony with the ideas that have always obtained as to
the manner in which a jury should deal with” such tables, when presented for
its consideration. Nor does the charge, read as a whole, so qualify or modify
the effect of either of these objectionable features as to render them clearly
inocuous. This case does not fall within art. 500 C.C.P.

Personally, I should have been prepared to
accept our decision in Barthe v. Huard2, as
conclusive that a new trial should be had in this case, even if counsel for the
defendant had failed to comply with the requirement of art. 498 (3) in regard
to taking exceptions to the charge at the trial, before verdict, and in the
actual presence of the trial judge. But I understand that some of my learned
brethren take a different view of the decision in Barthe v. Huard[2]. I, therefore, do not base this judgment
upon it.

There, no
objection to the charge was taken at the trial, although formal objections in writing
were filed after verdict, on the morning following the hearing. Notwithstanding
this state of facts, however, this court, reversing the Court of King’s Bench,
ordered a new trial. To quote from the judgment of Davies J., concurred in by Girouard and Duff JJ., a majority of the court,

While the judge’s charge to the jury was
not objected to as a whole, objection was taken to a particular part of it in
which the judge told the jury that “they should consider the case as if the
charge of drunkenness had been made against themselves, their brother or their
friend.”

I cannot but think that this was an
entirely wrong and false doctrine to lay down as to the proper functions of a
jury. It was calculated to mislead their minds as to the manner and extent to which
they should assess the damages or make their findings.

It is possible that if the learned judge’s
attention had been called to this language and its full meaning at the time,
and objection taken to it he would have corrected the apparently misleading direction
before the jury had retired, or if they had already retired, before they had
agreed upon their verdict, but no such objection was taken at the time.

This only goes to shew the imperative
necessity of Courts of Appeal insisting, when asked to grant new trials as a
matter of right, that only objections to particular statements made by the
judge in his charge to

[Page 126]

the jurу will be considered or given
effect to when it is shewn that objection has been taken to them at the time when their misleading character
can be corrected before the jury.

A converse case came to this court in Lamontagne
v. Quebec Light, Heat &
Power Company[3], of
which the headnote reads, in part, as follows:

Where no objection has been taken to the
judge’s charge to the jury at the trial and it does not appear that any
substantial prejudice was thereby occasioned there should not be an order for a
new trial under the provisions of articles 498 et seq. of the Code of
Civil Procedure.

Here, the
objections on both points of misdirection by the learned trial judge are to be
found formulated in the stenographer’s notes which were, apparently, made part
of the minutes of trial referred to in art. 506 С.С.Р.,
and, on that ground, would seem to have been treated by
the Court of King’s Bench as having been properly taken as exceptions under
art. 498 (3), С.С.Р., and as entitling the respondent to a new trial as a matter of right. It is said, however, by
counsel for the appellant that, although these objections are found in the
stenographer’s notes, those notes also shew that they were taken after the
learned judge had left the bench and while the jury was deliberating, and that
they were not known to the trial judge until after the verdict. In answer to
this, counsel for the respondent assures us that they had been stated, in
substance, to the learned judge before he left the bench and that they were
inserted in the stenographer’s notes by his express direction. I find it
unnecessary to pass upon the question of fact raised by this regrettable
contradiction.

In my view, it is also unnecessary now to decide
the question discussed by this court in Barthe v. Huard[4], and impliedly passed upon in Lamontagne
v. Quebec L.H. & P. Co.3, as to whether or not the respondent
was entitled, as a matter of
right, to the order for a new trial made by the Court of King’s Bench,
since I think that the result of the trial already had is so unsatisfactory
that we should, in the exercise of our judicial discretion, inherent and
statutory (R.S.C., c. 35, s. 47), affirm the order of the Court of King’s Bench
for a new trial. Without, therefore, involving art. 495 С.С.Р.,
and without expressing approval or disapproval of the
ground on which the Court of King’s Bench based its order, I accept its
conclusion.

[Page 127]

The costs of the appeal to this court shall be
to the defendant in any event of the cause, to be set off against the amount of
any verdict which the plaintiff may obtain on a new trial.

This somewhat unusual disposition is made in
ease of the plaintiff, who might otherwise be embarrassed by having to pay
these costs forthwith. As a price of this concession in favour of the plaintiff,
I think it reasonable to order the set-off directed,—the whole in the exercise
of the discretion conferred on us by s. 48 of the Supreme Court Act.

The judgment of Duff and Rinfret JJ. was delivered by

Rinfret J.—For the reasons given in the judgment of the Court of King’s Bench,
we agree that the particular statements referred to therein and made by the
learned trial judge in his charge to the jury were of a misleading character
and substantial prejudice to the respondent must have been thereby occasioned.
(Art. 500 C.P.)

The appellant urged that the misdirection
complained of could not be made the ground of an order for a new trial,
because, as he alleged, the objections to the misdirection were not taken at
the proper time.

It is not disputed that the objections were
taken before verdict. Further, we must hold that they were entered in the
minutes of trial as required by art. 506 C.P. They form part of the
stenographic report. The minutes of trial state the fact that the objections
were made and refer to the stenographic report for the purpose of ascertaining
what the nature of these objections was. But the contention is that they were
taken after the judge had retired, and, therefore, at a time when the
misleading character of the charge could not be corrected before the jury.

The article of the Code of Civil Procedure
dealing with this question reads as follows:—

498. Subject to the qualifications stated
in the next following articles, a new trial may be granted in any of the
following cases:

* *
*

3. When the judge has misdirected the jury
or refused to instruct them on a matter of law, and the party complaining has
duly excepted to such misdirection or refusal.

The French version uses the word “objecté” as
the corresponding word for “excepted.”

[Page 128]

It will be noticed that the article provides for
two distinct cases: the first is misdirection and the second is non-direction.
When there has been non-direction, the judge в must be asked to instruct the jury on the point of law he has
omitted to discuss; and if he refuses, exception must be taken to his refusal.
When there has been misdirection, all that is required, according to the
decision of the Court of King’s Bench, is that the party complaining should
have “duly excepted to such misdirection.”

That is precisely what the respondent has done
in the present case. The entry is as follows:—

“Le procureur de la
défenderesse excipe respectueusement
de la charge du juge aux jurés pour les raisons suivantes,” etc.

The Court of King’s Bench held that that was a
sufficient compliance with the requirements of the code, and it gave effect to
the objections.

As a mere question of the interpretation of the
code, we are not prepared to differ from the Court of King’s Bench on that
point. Moreover, this being a matter of practice and procedure, we should be
slow in reversing the judgment of the court of last resort of the province on a
question of that kind.

What we have said thus far would be sufficient
to dispose of the appeal; but, as there is to be a new trial, we think our view
ought to be stated as to a further point raised by the respondent.

At the time of the accident which gave rise to
the present action, there was in force, in the city of Montreal, bylaw no. 890
entitled: “Règlement relatif à la circulation et à la sécurité publique.” This by-law contained the following article:—

Article 15. Le
conducteur d’un véhicule, en virant à une croisée ou en passant d’une ruelle, d’un
garage ou d’une propriété privée, dans une rue, doit avertir de son intention
de ce faire, avancer avec beaucoup de prudence et attendre qu’il ait un passage
libre.

While the presiding judge was addressing the
jury, counsel for the defendant asked him to call their attention to that
by-law. Acceding to the request, the learned judge made reference to it in the
following way:

There is a by-law of the city of Montreal
known as by-law 890, an article of which I will read to you.

Article 15 of that by-law reads as follows:
(It is in French, I will translate it.)

[Page 129]

“The conductor of a vehicle, making a turn
at an intersection, or coming out of a lane or of a private property into a
street, must give notice of his intention so to do, advance with great prudence
and wait until the way is clear.

That is the by-law. I am not going to tell
you it applies to this case or not, that is the by-law.

No mention whatever of the by-law was made by
the learned trial judge when addressing the French-speaking jurors. The absence
of any reference to the by-law in the charge made in French and the manner in
which it was referred to in the charge made in English amounted, in our view,
to a refusal “to instruct (the jury) on a matter of law.”

On this point, even if the construction put
forward by the appellant should prevail, all the requirements of art. 498 (3)
of the code were fully met, and exception to the refusal was duly taken.

We think it was the duty of the trial judge to
instruct the jury as to the legal purport of article 15 of the by-law and to
tell them that they should consider whether, upon the proven facts, the
plaintiff complied with it and, if not, how far his failure to do so had any
bearing upon the accident which happened later. The refusal of the trial judge so
to instruct the jury, is an additional reason why a new trial should be
granted.

1. The disposition made by the Court of King’s
Bench of the costs of the appeal to that court should not be disturbed. We
notice, however, that, evidently through an oversight, no mention was made of
the costs of the abortive trial. This clerical omission should be corrected by
stating that these costs should be costs in the cause.

2. The costs of the present appeal should be to
the respondent in any event; but, for the reasons stated in that respect by our
Lord the Chief Justice, we think the right of the respondent to claim them
should be suspended until after the new trial, at which time, if the appellant
should secure a verdict in his favour, the respondent will be entitled to set
off the said costs against the amount of that verdict; if, on the contrary, the
verdict should be against the appellant, the respondent will then be entitled,
if so advised, to collect his costs in the usual way, the bond given by the
appellant upon his appeal to this court to remain in force in the meantime.

[Page 130]

Smith, J.—One of the grounds of appeal is that objections to the
misdirection of the trial judge were not taken at the time and in the manner
required by the Code of Civil Procedure, article 498. The Court of King’s Bench
have held against this contention, and I agree with my brother Rinfret that we
should not lightly interfere with the judgment of that court upon a mere matter
of practice and procedure unless there is clear error. This, in itself, might
be a sufficient ground for dismissing this appeal.

I am, however, also in agreement with my Lord
the Chief Justice that the trial already had, having regard to the manner in
which the case was presented by the learned trial judge to the jury, cannot, as
a whole, be regarded as other than most unsatisfactory; and that the result of
that trial is so unsatisfactory that we should, in the exercise of our
discretion under article 495 and R.S.C.,
c. 35, s. 47, affirm the order of the Court of King’s Bench for a new trial.
There is no doubt that, in view of the express provisions of article 498 as to
new trials, resort for the granting of a new trial should not ordinarily be had
to these general provisions. Where, however, the ends of justice clearly
require it, as here, this may be done.

In addition to the misdirection on the two
points referred to in the Court of King’s Bench, I am in agreement with what my
brother Rinfret says as to the by-law he refers to, and there is also to be
noted the evident lack of information upon the part of the jury when they
proceeded to consider their verdict. An amendment of the claim for damages had
been asked and granted at the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, by which the
amount of damages originally claimed under each heading was greatly increased.
The answer of the jury as to the amount of damages that they awarded was first
in the following words: “Plein montant réclamé * * * Unanime”. Then we have, in
the “extrait du procès-verbal d’audience”, the following:

Les jurés reviennent dans la salle d’audience.

Appelés, ils répondent à leurs noms et ils
donnent les réponses qui suivent.

Mais comme ils ne spécifient pas clairement
les dommages qu’ils accordent, la cour leur demande de retourner dans leur
chambre de délibérations, et d’exprimer par un chiffre le montant des dommages
qu’ils conviennent d’accorder.

Ce qu’ils font pour revenir avec leurs
réponses complétées à la satisfaction du tribunal.

[Page 131]

From this it is quite clear that the jury, in
returning the verdict for the full amount claimed, had no idea of what that
amount was, and were prepared to give a verdict for the full amount, whatever
it might be. They were sent back to find out the amount in figures, and then
returned with the amount $23,040 filled in, after the words “Plein montant réclamé”.

A verdict for this large amount, arrived at in
this manner, is certainly unsatisfactory, and a strong ground for ordering a
new trial.

I agree with the disposition of the costs of
this appeal proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice and my brother Rinfret, and
agree with the latter that the costs of the abortive trial should be provided
for as he suggests, and that it would be well to have it specially mentioned
that the bond for costs of appeal to this court is to remain in force.

Cannon, J.—Pour les motifs exposés dans ses notes par l’Honorable Juge-en-chef de la province de Québec, je suis d’avis de
confirmer l’arrêt de la Cour du Banc du Roi accordant un nouveau procès. L’appel
doit donc être renvoyé. J’accepte aussi la décision de l’Honorable Juge-en-chef
du Canada quant aux dépens devant cette cour.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF
THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Statutes—Retrospective construction—Statute giving new
right of appeal—21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025, Cr. Code).

Legislation
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal
cannot be construed retrospectively, so as to cover cases arising prior to such
legislation, unless there is something making unmistakeable the legislative intention
that it should be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right. (Doran
v. Jewell, 49 Can. S.C.R. 88; Upper Canada College v. Smith,
61 Can. S.C.R. 413).

In the present
case, held, that 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025 of the Cr. Code)
did not give a right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the
sustaining of the appellant’s conviction by a judgment of the Appellate
Division, Ont., rendered prior to such legislation.

APPEAL by the
defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Ontario[1], dismissing his appeal from his
conviction by Wright J.[2]

[Page 71]

of offences against
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy,
contrary to the provisions of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b) and (d)
of the Criminal Code .



Singer, the present
appellant, was tried jointly with others, namely, Belyea, Weinraub, O’Connor,
Paddon and Ward. At the trial, Singer, Paddon and Ward were found guilty; and
Belyea, Weinraub and O’Connor were found not guilty2 Singer, Paddon
and Ward appealed from their conviction; and the Attorney-General for Ontario
(under the provisions of the Act of 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28, amending
the Criminal Code ) appealed against the acquittal of Belyea and
Weinraub. The Appellate Division1 dismissed the appeals of Singer,
Paddon and Ward; and allowed the appeals of the Attorney-General, and set aside
the acquittal of Belyea and Weinraub and adjudged them guilty.[3]










The present appeal was
brought under s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36), as
amended by 21-22 Geo. V (1931), c. 28, s. 15. By said amending Act (s. 15), the
following was substituted for subs. 3 of said s. 1025 :



3. Any person
whose acquittal has been set aside may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
against the setting aside of such acquittal, and any person who was tried
jointly with such acquitted person, and whose conviction was sustained by the
Court of Appeal, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the
sustaining of such conviction.



The present appellant
was convicted on March 23, 1931, and his conviction was sustained by the
Appellate Division on June 26, 1931. The said amending Act, which was assented
to on August 3, 1931, provided (s. 16) that it should come into force on
September 1, 1931.



A question of
jurisdiction arose, counsel for the respondent contending that no appeal lay;
that the said amendment, which was subsequent to the judgment in question of
the Appellate Division, was not retroactive, and upon the delivery of the
judgment the conviction was affirmed, and the right of appeal must date from
the rights in law existing at the time of the delivery of judgment.

W.F. O’Connor K.C. for the appellant.

D.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.C. McRuer K.C.
for the respondent.

[Page 72]



At the opening of the
hearing of the appeal, argument was heard upon the question of jurisdiction,
and after hearing counsel for the parties, the Court retired for a few minutes
for consideration and, on its returning to the Bench, the Chief Justice delivered
judgment orally as follows:



ANGLIN C.J.C.—The
appeal in this case was taken under s. 15, c. 28, Stats. of Canada, 1931, which
became law on the 1st of September, 1931. The appellant was convicted on the
23rd of March, 1931, and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on
the 26th of June, 1931.



It is common ground
that, unless there is something making unmistakeable the intention of the
Legislature that a retrospective construction should be put upon the
legislation so that it may cover cases arising prior thereto, no clause,
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal, can
be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right.










The decision in Doran
v. Jewell[4], is binding upon us and is conclusive to that
effect. If further authority be required on this point, it may be found in Upper
Canada College v. Smith[5].



The language relied
upon here, as indicative of the intention of the Legislature to require a
retrospective construction of the Act, consists merely in the fact that the
perfect tense is used in dealing with the matter. This, however, is legislation
in regard to appeals, where it seems almost inevitable that the past, or
perfect, tense should be used, as the matter dealt with, viz., the conviction
in the judgment appealed from, must necessarily be an event of the past when
the appeal is taken. At all events, we find nothing in the language of the
Legislature in this amendment to the Criminal Code  indicative of an
intention that it should receive a retrospective construction.

Appeal
quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Section
1025 Cr. С.—Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada—Conflicting decisions—“Judgment
of any other court of appeal”—Must be courts within Canada—Cr. C. s. 1012, 1025.

The provisions of section 1025  of the
Criminal Code , giving right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, upon
leave to appeal being granted, “if the judgment appealed from conflicts with
the judgment

[Page 159]

of any other court of appeal,” must be taken
to refer to courts within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and not
to courts outside the Canadian territory. Brunet v. The King ([1928] S.C.R. 161) ref.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a
decision of the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], upholding the conviction of the appellant
for the offence of selling narcotic drugs.

Lucien Gendron for the applicant

Gustave Monette contra.

RINFRET J.—The application is made under section 1025  of the Criminal Code , on
the ground that the judgment appealed from conflicts with two decisions of the
Court for Crown Cases Reserved, in England, respectively delivered in 1890 and
1894.

I think the alleged conflict does not bring the
case within the condition essentially required by section 1025  of the Criminal
Code . The wording of the section is that the conflict must be “with the judgment
of any other court of appeal.” In my view, those words used without
qualification in a Canadian statute mean any other Canadian court of appeal.
When the legislature of this country uses language of that kind it must be
taken to refer to courts within its jurisdiction, and not to courts outside the
Canadian territory. (Jeffrys v. Boosey [2]; Cooke v. Charles A. Vogeler
& Company[3]. It is
to no purpose to argue that criminal courts in Canada may, and possibly will,
follow the decisions of the English courts of criminal appeal. The whole
question here is what parliament is presumed to have intended when referring to
“any other court of appeal” in section 1025 of the Canadian Criminal Code; and
I think the principle is that general words in a statute refer only to persons
or things within the territory, unless the con intention is shewn.

In addition to the rule just stated, we have in
section 1012 of the code the legislative interpretation of the words in
question precisely for that part of the Criminal Code 

[Page 160]

dealing with appeals from convictions on
indictments. Under subsection (b) of section 1012,

“court of appeal” means the court
designated by paragraph (7) of section. 2 of this Act (i.e., the code) as the
court of appeal from the province in which the conviction or indictment was
had.

Paragraph 7 of section 2 just mentioned is an
enumeration of the courts of the several provinces of Canada which are stated
to be included in the expression “court of appeal.”

The evident intention of Parliament in enacting
section. 1025 was to insure uniformity in the administration of criminal law by
the courts of Canada. Bearing that in mind, the expression “any other court of
appeal” should, I think, be interpreted as meaning any other court of appeal to
which “a like case” may be brought under the Canadian Criminal Code, and
therefore: any other court of appeal in Canada.

I have, for these reasons, reached the
conclusion that the petitioner does not allege nor show a conflict between the
courts of appeal contemplated by section 1025  of the Criminal Code , and that
this is not a case where I have jurisdiction under that section to grant leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The petitioner relied, of course, on the
decision in Brunet v. The
King[4], where
special leave was granted in not dissimilar circumstances. It will be seen,
however, that when the case came before the full court (including the learned
judge who granted leave), the court took particular care to state (Brunet v. The King)[5], that it was not. “passing on the question
of whether or not this is an appealable matter, even with leave.”

For that reason, I feel that I am at liberty to
decide as above. If I am wrong the appellant may yet find relief by asking the
full court to revise my decision. (In re Sproule[6]; The Industrial Acceptance Corporation v.
Canada Permanent Trust Company[7].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Practice and procedure—Jury
trial—Charge of the trial judge—Misdirection—Sworn statement by stenographer
conflicting with report of the judge—Section 1020 Cr. C.

The appellant, having been convicted of the
crime of rape and condemned to fifteen years imprisonment and lashes, appealed
to the court of appeal principally on the ground that the trial judge had erred
in his

[Page 195]

instructions given to the jury. In the record
were the notes of the stenographer at the trial who certified, under oath, to
the delivery of a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him,
contained a clear misdirection. The appellate court, having determined that, on
the stenographic transcription, the appeal should be allowed, directed that a
report be furnished by the trial judge in accordance with section 1020 Cr. C.
The trial judge then prepared, two or three months after the trial, a
certificate containing a number of statements made by him in answer to a
corresponding number of objections to his charge which formed the grounds of
appeal and stating, according to his recollection, that in fact his direction
was precisely the contrary of that reported.

Held that such
certificate of the trial judge was not a report within section 1020 Cr. C.: it
did not contain the judge’s “notes of the trial” nor was it a “report giving
his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case”; and,
therefore, the court being left with nothing authentic and regularly before the
court to establish that the charge was not as reported, the appellant was
clearly entitled to a new trial. Section 1020 Cr. C. apparently contemplates
that the judge or the magistrate should furnish “his notes of the trial” or his
report immediately after the trial, or at least, so soon as an appeal is
lodged; and it was never intended by this section to enable the trial judge,
after an appeal had been argued, to put before the court of appeal, by way of
certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or by direction of the
court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken upon the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the
appellant for the crime of rape.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment
now reported.

C. Bourgeois K.C. for the appellant.

P. Bigué K.C. and Laetare Roy K.C. for
the respondent.

At the close of the arguments by counsel for the
appellant and for the respondent, the judgment of the court was orally
delivered by

Anglin C.J.C.—We regard this as a case of the utmost importance. A
conviction for the crime of rape is always a serious matter. In the present
case it is more than ordinarily so because the penalty imposed is fifteen years
imprisonment and lashes.

[Page 196]

It is the aim of this court, as of all courts of
law, to do justice,—not abstract justice, but justice according to law.
Elementary justice seems to require that a conviction for a serious crime
should not stand if it may have been based on illegal evidence.

In criminal matters, under s. 1014 of the Code,
the court of appeal may set aside a conviction, if of the opinion “that on any
ground there was a miscarriage of justice.” This power might well have been
exercised here having regard to the charge as a whole. But, our jurisdiction is
much more restricted. Under s. 1023 we can entertain an appeal only

against the affirmance of (a)
conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court
of Appeal.

The present case has some most unpleasant
aspects. A stenographer of repute has certified, under oath, to the delivery of
a charge by the trial judge which, as reported by him, contains a clear
misdirection. The learned trial judge, as reported, told the jury that a
statement of the complainant to her aunt, which was admissible only to show the
consistency of her conduct, in itself amounted to distinct evidence of the
guilt of the accused.

On the other hand, we have also before us a
statement or certificate, furnished by the trial judge under direction of the
Court of King’s Bench, in which he says his direction was not as so reported,
but precisely the contrary. This is relied upon by the Crown as a report under
s. 1020  of the Criminal Code , and it is contended that effect must be given to
it and the stenographer’s transcription ignored.

Were the certificate of the trial judge before
us really a report made in conformity with s. 1020  of the Criminal Code , the
case would present greater difficulty and it may be that effect would have to
be given to it. But, as we read s. 1020 , the certificate of the trial judge now
before us, which consists in a number of statements made by him in answer to a
corresponding number of objections to his charge, which formed the grounds of
appeal, and was prepared by him some two or three months after the trial and
after the argument of the appeal in the Court of King’s Bench—indeed, counsel
assure us, after that court had determined that, on the stenographic
transcription, the appeal before it must be allowed,—is not such a report as

[Page 197]

s. 1020  contemplates. It certainly does not
contain the learned judge’s “notes of the trial”; nor is it a “report giving
his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case.”

S. 1020  provides that, as part of the material
to be put before the court of appeal, the trial judge or magistrate shall
furnish to the court “his notes of the trial” and shall also send “a report
giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case” and
apparently contemplates this being done immediately after the trial, or at
least, so soon as an appeal is lodged. It was never intended by this section to
enable the trial judge, after an appeal had been argued, to put before the
court of appeal by way of certificate or otherwise, whether proprio motu or
by direction of the court of appeal, his answer to the various points taken
upon the appeal. That, in substance, is what has been done in this case. We
cannot regard such a certificate of the trial judge as having been properly
given, nor as a report within s. 1020 . That being so, we are left with nothing
authentic and regularly before the court to establish that the charge was not
what the stenographic transcription shews; and upon that, as already stated,
the misdirection is so plain and so fatal in its consequences that a new trial
is inevitable. Justice requires that a conviction where there is such grave
uncertainty as to the propriety of the direction under which it was made should
not be allowed to stand.

That such uncertainty exists in this case is
obvious, since, against the accuracy of the note made at the moment of
utterance by a careful, sworn stenographer, acting in the discharge of his
usual functions, there is nothing but the recollection by a judge, however
eminent and careful, of the precise language used by him some two or three
months before.

This case is most exceptional. We trust such
circumstances will not again arise; and the present decision can be relied upon
only in a case which is on all fours with that before us.

The conviction will accordingly be set aside and
a new trial had.

Appeal allowed.

Act , R.S.C. [1927], c. 60, ss. 127, 128, 176—Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,
R.S.C. [1927], c. 144, s. 4— Information—Sufficiency as to description of

Per Rinfret J.—Under section 654 of the Criminal Code ,
any person, upon reasonable or probable grounds, may make a complaint or lay an
information against an accused person in respect of the offences, relating to
illicit distilling, mentioned in section 176  of the Excise Act ; but even
if it should be inferred from the provisions of that Act taken as a whole that
officers of excise alone were competent to lay such information, it would not
be necessary, though perhaps desirable, to specify particulars of the informant
in the warrant of commitment. Moreover, the information laid against some of
the applicants, which describes the informant, as a customs and excise officer
acting "" on behalf of His Majesty the King "" was quite sufficient to
justify the magistrate in proceeding with the trial. R. v. Limerick
(37 C.C.C. 344) and R. v. Ed. (47 C.C.C. 196) dist.

Per Rinfret J.—On an application for habeas corpus,
a contention by the petitioner that no proof of the authority of the informant
was adduced at the trial does not raise a question of jurisdiction: if the
judge before whom the application is made is right in his view that the
magistrate had the right to enter on, and proceed with, the case, he had not to
consider the sufficiency of the evidence on which the former was convicted. R.
v. Nat Bell Liquors ([1922] 2 A.C. 128, at pp. 151, 152) foll.

 [Page 46]

Per Rinfret J. Under sections 127 and 128 of the Excise
Act , a magistrate has the power both to imprison and fine the accused by
summary conviction and is not restricted to impose one penalty to the exclusion
of the other.

Per Rinfret J.—When the order of imprisonment is
absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a
fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of the inferior tribunal are
severable. Therefore, when a petitioner urges, as a ground for the issue of a
writ of habeas corpus, the illegality of the part dealing with the
further imprisonment, such application is premature before the expiration of
the term for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of imprisonment; up
to that time, the applicant cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of
his liberty.

Per Rinfret J.—Where a warrant of commitment contains a
valid order of imprisonment and also an order imposing a lighter fine than the
minimum imposed by the statute, this order being illegal, the portion providing
for imprisonment is nevertheless valid; and the illegal order can still be
remedied by applying the provisions of sections 754  and 1125  of the Criminal
Code .

Per Rinfret J.—A warrant of commitment requiring the
payment of the costs of conveying the accused to jail is not invalid for
failure to state the amount of these costs.

Per Rinfret J.—The word "" penalties "" in par.
2 of s. 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act means the imprisonment and
the fine and does not include the costs. Therefore, a condemnation to a fine of
"" two hundred dollars"" will not be invalid as being a lighter fine
than the minimum ($200 and costs), imposed by section 4, par. (d) (b)2(?)
of that section. Moreover, nothing in the Act compels the magistrate to award
costs; and in such a case, section 735  of the Criminal Code , under which the
costs are in the discretion of the magistrate, would apply.

The judgments of Rinfret J.,
in chambers, rendered upon these four applications for habeas corpus,
were, on appeal, affirmed by the Court,

Held, that, in the cases of Henderson, Broder and Joe Go
Get, the warrant of commitment shewed a valid conviction, and even assuming it
to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated, that would not
be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus: Section
1121 , Criminal Code .

Held, also, that, in the Stewart case, assuming the
defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any
of the defective clauses, and the application is at best premature.

APPEAL from the judgments of
Rinfret J. dismissing petitions for a writ of habeas corpus.

The material facts, and the
grounds of the petitions are sufficiently set out in the judgments of Rinfret
J. now reported.

The appeal from the judgments was
dismissed.

The petitions were heard by
Rinfret J. on June 4, 1929.

National Revenue.

On June 5, 1929, Rinfret J. gave
judgment as follows:

RINFRET J.:—

In re John Henderson.

In re John George Broder.

The applicant Henderson complains
that he is illegally detained in custody in Oakalla Prison Farm, a common gaol
for the county of Vancouver,
and prays for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directed to W. G.
McMynn, the warden of the prison, and for his subsequent discharge.

The same relief has already been
refused by the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and
by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald, a judge of the same province[1].

According to the warrant of
commitment by reason of which he is held prisoner, Henderson was
convicted before H. O. Alexander, a stipendiary magistrate in and for the county of
Vancouver, for that he,

on December 5, 1928, at
Pocahontas Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully, without having a
licence under the Excise Act  then in force, did have in his possession a still
suitable for the manufacture of spirits, without having given notice thereof as
required by the Excise Act , such still not having been a duly registered
chemical still of capacity not exceeding three gallons, as provided for in the
Excise Act , contrary to the form of statute in such case made and provided

and he was adjudged

to be imprisoned in the
common gaol for the said county of Vancouver at
Oakalla Prison farm, Burnaby, in the county of Westminster, in the province of British
  Columbia, for the term of twelve
months,

and also that he shall

forfeit and pay the sum of
five hundred dollars ($500) to be paid and applied according to law and, in
default of payment of the said sum of $500, that he should be imprisoned in the
said common gaol for the county of Vancouver in the county of Westminster for a
further term of six months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and
charges of conveying (him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

[Page 48]

The warrant commanded the
constables or peace officers in the county of Vancouver to take and convey Henderson 

to the common gaol at
Oakalla Prison Farm aforesaid and there to deliver him to the said keeper
thereof, together with this precept;

and commanded the keeper to
receive Henderson

into (his) custody in the
said common gaol and there to imprison him for the term of twelve months.

The warrant further commanded the
keeper to imprison Henderson

for the further term of six
months to commence at the expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded
by the sentence above set out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and
charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said Henderson *** to the
said gaol are sooner paid unto the said keeper or until he shall be otherwise
discharged in due course of law.

The application is based on a
number of grounds and I will endeavour to consider and determine them in the
order in which they are submitted to me:

1. The trial magistrate is
alleged to have been

without jurisdiction to try
the case and to take proceedings on the information sworn or to act thereon

because the informer

did not swear that he was an
excise officer or acting under instructions from the Minister of National
Revenue, and the proceedings were void ab initio, as no averment is
sufficient in excise cases.

There is authority in this court for
the proposition that, on the return of a writ of habeas corpus, the only
consideration which can be entered upon by a judge of the Supreme Court of
Canada is the sufficiency of the commitment. (In re Trépanier[2];
In re Sproule[3];
Ex parte McDonald[4].

In this case, however, the
applicant further complains that the magistrate neglected

to show in the warrant and
conviction that the proceeding by summary conviction was by virtue of the
authority of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise, ss. 133
and 134 of the Excise Act .

And, in addition to a copy of the
warrant of commitment, the petitioner has filed before me, without objection
from the Crown, copies of the conviction, of the information and other papers
accompanied by an affidavit, to show the alleged want of jurisdiction.

[Page 49]

I find nothing in sections 133 
and 134  of the Excise Act  to the effect that the commitment must show
the proceedings to have been held

by virtue of the authority
of the Minister of National Revenue, Department of Excise.

The offence, of which Henderson
is stated in the warrant to have been convicted, is covered by s. 176  (e)
of the Excise Act  where it is declared to be an indictable offence,
(although by force of section 127 of the Act, the penalty or forfeiture and the
punishment may be sued for and recovered or imposed by summary conviction). The
offence is not in terms one which is only cognizable upon the information of a
specified class of persons. All provisions of the criminal code relating to
indictable offences apply to it (see Interpretation Act, c. 1 of R.S.C.
1927). It may therefore be argued with great force that anyone, upon reasonable
or probable grounds, may make a complaint or layan information against an
accused person in respect of such offence. (Crim. Code, s. 654). There are
sections of the Excise Act  giving special powers to inspectors and
officers appointed under it for the purposes of entry into buildings, or into
the premises of any dealer, of inspection and examination of apparatus, works,
stills, etc.; also, under the authority of a writ of assistance, for the
purpose of searching for, seizing and securing goods or things liable to
forfeiture under the Act and of arresting and detaining any person whom they
detect in the commission of any offence against the provisions of the Act. No
powers are stated to be required to lay an information in respect of an offence
under s. 176 ; and counsel for the petitioner was unable to point to any section
of the Act having that effect.

Should we, however, infer from
the provisions of the Excise Act  taken as a whole that officers of
excise alone are competent to lay informations concerning offences against
section 176 , even then it is not necessary, though perhaps desirable, to
specify particulars of the informant in the warrant of commitment (Paley on
Summary Convietions, 9th ed. p. 470). This would dispose of the argument that
the authority of the informant is not shown in the warrant of commitment.

Assuming however that ""for
the purpose of an inquiry into the case of commitment"" (which is the
extent of my

[Page 50]

jurisdiction under s. 62 of the Supreme
Court Act) I should go behind the warrant, I find in the information laid
against Henderson, and of which he himself filed a copy before me,
that the informant is therein described as a customs and excise officer acting
"" on behalf of His Majesty the King "". The information was taken and
sworn before the stipendiary magistrate and, in my view, the oath of the
informant covered the particulars relating to his capacity and authority to
act. This was quite sufficient (Crim. Code 1128) to justify the magistrate in
proceeding with the trial, even if it be true that only an officer of excise
could lay the information.

I will say nothing of the fact
that, admittedly, this point was not taken at the trial.

I am not overlooking the
decisions in Rex v. Limerick[5], and Rex v. Ed.[6]
In addition to what I have already said upon the points which they cover, I may
add that neither case was an application for habeas corpus. Rex v. Limerick[7]
was a proceeding for the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Act and was
before the court on an order for certiorari. It was there made to appear
that the informant was not an officer of the department of Inland Revenue and,
at the hearing, the magistrate's jurisdiction had been challenged. In Rex v.
Ed[8],
a case was stated for the opinion of the court after the appellant was found
guilty in a prosecution under the Income War Tax Act, and 

as stated by the magistrate,
it was not alleged in the information or shown in the evidence before him that
(the informant) was authorized by the Finance Department or any other
department of the Government to lay the information or otherwise to enforce the
provisions of the Income War Tax Act (Rex v. Ed.[9]
).

Both cases are distinguishable
from the present one.

As to the contention that no
proof of the authority of the informant was adduced at the trial, I would say
that it does not raise the question of jurisdiction. If I am right in my view
that the magistrate had the right to enter on the case, I am not to consider
the sufficiency of the evidence on which he convicted. (In re Trépanier[10].
In the words of Lord Sumner, re Rex v. Nat. Bell Liquors[11],

[Page 51]

A justice who convicts
without evidence is doing something that he ought not to do, but he is doing it
as a judge, and if his jurisdiction to entertain the charge is not open to
impeachment, his subsequent error, however grave, is a wrong exercise of a
jurisdiction which he has, and not a usurpation of a jurisdiction which he has
not ***. To say that there is no jurisdiction to convict without evidence is
the same as saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right, and
none if it is wrong; or that jurisdiction at the outset of a case continues so
long as the decision stands, but that, if it is set aside, the real conclusion
is that there never was jurisdiction.

For all these reasons the
petitioner fails on the first ground of his application.

2. The second ground may be
stated as follows: The information was first laid before P. C. Parker,
stipendiary magistrate. It was afterwards withdrawn and a new information was
laid before H. O. Alexander, another stipendiary magistrate whose jurisdiction,
so it is contended, was barred by sections 85 (4)  and 129  of the Excise Act .

Section 85 must be disregarded.
It has no application to this case, which is not a prosecution under its
provisions, but, as already stated, a proceeding by summary conviction under
sections 176 and 127 of the Act (as amended by c. 24 of 18-19 Geo. V).

Section 129  reads as follows:

129. If any prosecution in
respect of an offence against any provision of this Act is brought before a
judge of a county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or
before any two justices of the peace, no other justice of the peace shall sit
or take part therein: Provided, however, that in any city or district in which
there are more than one judge of a county court, or more than one police or
stipendiary magistrate, such prosecution may be tried before any one of such
judges or police or stipendiary magistrates.

It is not disputed that
Alexander, the stipendiary magistrate who tried the case, found the conviction
and signed the commitment, had jurisdiction territorially and otherwise to try
a case of this kind, but it is contended that he could "" not sit or take
part therein "", because the prosecution was brought first before P. C.
Parker.

On the facts as stated, section
129  does not apply. The information laid before Parker having been withdrawn,
Alexander cannot be said to have sat or taken part in a prosecution brought
before Parker. But whatever the facts may have been, they are not apparent on
the face of the warrant of commitment and, under the well settled jurisprudence
of this court referred to in Ex parte McDonald[12]

[Page 52]

my jurisdiction in the present
case ""is limited to an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as
disclosed by the warrant of commitment"".

The second ground of attack
cannot therefore be entertained by me.

3. As a third ground for the
application, it is contended that the magistrate

had no power to imprison and
fine by summary conviction, but that he could only do one or the other.

Sections 127  and 128  of the Excise
Act  afford a complete answer to this contention. The offence of Henderson
must be taken to have been his first offence, inasmuch as the commitment does
not shew otherwise. Under section 176, the penalty for a first offence is

a penalty not exceeding
$2,000 and not less than $200 and to imprisonment, with or without hard labour,
for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month, and, in
default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment not
exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.

Section 127  (as amended by c. 24 of
18-19 Geo. V.) reads in part as follows:

127. (1) Every penalty or
forfeiture incurred and any punishment for any offence against the provisions
of this Act, or any other law relating to excise, may be sued for and
recovered, or may be imposed (a) before the Exchequer Court of Canada or
any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or (b) if the
amount or value of such penalty or forfeiture does not exceed five thousand
dollars and such punishment does not exceed twelve months imprisonment with
hard labour, whether the offence in respect of which it has been incurred is
declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not, by summary conviction,
under the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating thereto, before a judge of a
county court, or before a police or stipendiary magistrate, or any two justices
of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the cause of prosecution
arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.

*****

(3) Any such pecuniary
penalty may, if not forthwith paid, be levied by distress and sale of goods and
chattels of the offender, under the warrant of the court, judge, magistrate, or
justices having cognizance of the case; or the said court, judge, magistrate,
or justices may, in its or their discretion, commit the offender to the common
gaol for a period not exceeding twelve months, unless the penalty and costs,
including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the
warrant of committal, are sooner paid.

Section 128  reads:

128. Any term of imprisonment
imposed for any offence against the provisions of this Act, whether in
conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not, may be adjudged and ordered

(a) by the Exchequer
Court of Canada, or any court of record having jurisdiction in the premises; or

[Page 53]

(b) if such term of
imprisonment does not exceed twelve months, exclusive of any term of
imprisonment which may be adjudged or ordered for non-payment of any pecuniary
penalty, whether the offence in respect of which the liability to imprisonment
has been incurred is declared by this Act to be an indictable offence or not,
by summary conviction under the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
thereto by a judge of a county court, or by a police or stipendiary magistrate,
or any two justices of the peace having jurisdiction in the place where the
cause of prosecution arises, or wherein the defendant is served with process.

As will have been noticed,
section 127  alone was sufficient in this case to found jurisdiction in the
stipendiary magistrate; and section 128  applies when the term of imprisonment
is imposed "" whether in conjunction with a pecuniary penalty or not.""

4. The next contention in support
of the application is that the warrant of commitment is bad

in neglecting to state where
the defendant was found or the cause of prosecution arises.

The warrant states

that the said John Henderson
*** on December 5, 1928, at Pocahontas
 Bay, in the county of Vancouver, unlawfully *** did have in his
possession a still, etc.

H. O. Alexander, before whom Henderson was
found guilty and was convicted, is "" a stipendiary magistrate in and for
the said county of Vancouver.""
The jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings. Moreover, courts would
take judicial notice of the "" local divisions of their country.""
(Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., 17; Sleeth v. Hurlbert[13].)

Nor was it necessary, as urged by
counsel, that, at the time of the arrest, Henderson should have the still in his own actual possession
at Pocahontas Bay. Having possession includes as well having in
the custody of any other person or having in any place for the benefit or use
of one's self or of any other person (Criminal Code , s. 5 ).

5. Then it is contended that the
warrant is bad, ""by neglecting to show to whom the fine is to be
paid,"" the words used being: "" to be paid and applied according to
law.""

The warrant shews that Henderson
is condemned to an imprisonment of twelve months and also to a fine of $500,
and to a further imprisonment of six months unless the said sum of $500 ""
should be sooner paid."" The further term of six months is

[Page 54]

to commence at the
expiration of the said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence above set
out unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of the commitment and
of the conveying *** to the said jail are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.

To avoid further imprisonment, Henderson
knows from the warrant that he must pay to the keeper. Assuming that he is
concerned with the subsequent appropriation of the fine, s.s. 133 and 134 of the
Excise Act  make a complete and determinate disposal of it. If they did
not, art. 1036  of the Criminal Code  would apply. So that the judgment can be
unequivocally carried into effect by reference to the Act alone (R. v. Seal
[14]).

6. The last objection taken by
the petitioner is as to the question of costs. It is urged by him

that the conviction and
warrant do not comply with the statutes in regard to "" costs of conveying
to gaol "" or costs of "" commitment.""

Under s. 127 of the Excise
Act , the magistrate could

commit the offender to the
common gaol for a period not exceeding 12 months, unless the penalty and costs,
including those of conveying the offender to such gaol and stated in the
warrant of committal are sooner paid.

The adjudication in the warrant
now before me, in default of payment of the fine of $500, is that Henderson
should be imprisoned

for a further term of six
months unless the said sum of $500 and the costs and charges of conveying (him)
to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

Then, in the operative part of
the warrant, the keeper is commanded to imprison him for the further  term of
six months *** unless the said sum of $500 and the costs of the commitment and
of the conveying *** to the said gaol are sooner paid unto *** the said keeper.


But the further term of six
months is to commence (only)

at the expiration of the
said term of twelve months awarded by the sentence.

Henderson complains that:

(a) The costs of
commitment were not adjudged against him and that yet, under the warrant, he
will have to remain six months in prison, unless he pays them.

(b) The amount of the
costs which he must pay is not stated in the commitment.

Henderson was validly convicted on the 5th January, 1929. It was
then validly adjudged, for the offence of which he was legally found guilty,
that he should be im-

[Page 55]

prisoned for the term of twelve
months. It is not disputed that the punishment is perfectly good under the
statute. The term of twelve months will expire only on the 5th day of January,
1930. Until then he cannot complain that he is illegally restrained of his
liberty, nor kept in illegal confinement. The warrant of commitment is
sufficient for the keeper to retain him in gaol until the expiration of the
term of twelve months for which the conviction imposed an absolute order of
imprisonment.

Where the order of imprisonment
is absolute for a term and a further term is imposed in default of payment of a
fine and costs, the conviction and commitment of an inferior tribunal are
severable. This proposition has now been accepted by our courts. The court of
appeal for Ontario in The King v. Carlisle[15];
the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of Quebec in La Commission des
Liqueurs de Québec v. Forcade[16];
and the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Rex v. Fox [17];
to which may be added the opinion of Mr. Justice Beck of the Court of Appeal
for Alberta in Rex v. Miller [18]. I see
no reason to differ from these judgments.

Paley on Summary convictions (8th
ed. at p. 201) admits that an order is divisible and "" may be quashed in
part "", and, as said in Rex v. Robinson[19],
quoted by Mr. Justice W. A. Macdonald in his judgment on a similar application[20],

there is no reason worthy of
the name to be found in the books why there should be any distinction in this
respect between an order and a conviction.

I therefore think that, so far as
concerns that portion of the warrant of commitment dealing with further
imprisonment in default of payment of fine and costs, the application is
premature. I do not want however to be understood as meaning that that part of
the commitment is invalid. The writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative
process available when "" there is a deprivation of personal liberty
without legal justification "" (Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 10, p. 48).
Courts should not permit the use of this great writ to free criminals on mere
technicalities. It is

[Page 56]

the spirit of our Criminal Laws
and more particularly of our law on summary convictions that defects and
informalities be corrected so as "" to prevent a denial of justice ""
(Crim. Code 723, 753, 754, 1120, 1124, 1125 and 1129).

I have been referred to a number
of judgments holding a warrant of commitment invalid because it required
payment of conveyance to gaol and it did not state the amount of those costs. I
have noticed that none of the learned judges who have so decided took the
trouble of telling us at the same time how the magistrate, so as to insert the
amount in the warrant, could determine in advance the costs of conveyance. I
fully agree with what is said on that point by Murphy J. in Rex v. Wong[21].
A proper method—and there should be others—for the determination of those costs
is set out in Poulin v. City of Quebec[22]
where Sir François Lemieux, at page 392, decides as follows:

By this petition for habeas
corpus (the petitioner) demands to be discharged on two main grounds, *** ;

secondly, because the
conviction should have stated the amount of conveying the petitioner to gaol.

This last ground is without
foundation.

The condemnation for the
costs includes the cost of conveyance, and these expenses, contrary to the
claim of the petitioner, should not, and could not, be included in the
conviction.

When the law permits
conviction for costs, it includes, not only the costs of the prosecution but
also those of carrying out the judgment of the conviction.

It is impossible for the
magistrate or the Recorder's Court, and it is not in a position to fix and
determine in advance the cost of conveyance. These costs are, or should be,
stated or certified by the officer who executes the commitment upon the back of
the commitment, which is the general practice and which was done in this very
case. The certificate authorizes the jailer to require payment of the amount if
the offender desires to be discharged from gaol.

In this case, I have, for the
above reasons, come to the conclusion that the objections fail to support the
application for the prisoner's release and the said application will therefore
be dismissed.

In the case of George Broder, the
conviction and the warrant of commitment are identical and for a similar
offence; the application is based on exactly the same grounds as that of John
Henderson and it will accordingly be dismissed for the same reasons.

[Page 57]

In re James Stewart

This is an application for habeas
corpus by James Stewart, formerly of the city of Vancouver and
at present imprisoned at Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, county of
Westminster, province of British Columbia.

The offence for which Stewart was
convicted, the conviction and the warrant of commitment are similar to those in
the cases of John Henderson and George Broder. The grounds of the application
are the same, except one which I shall state presently. For the reasons already
given in dismissing the petitions of Henderson and Broder, to which I refer the
parties and their counsel, I think the similar objections raised in this case
fail to support the application for Stewart's release.

The other ground, which was
available neither to Henderson, nor to Broder, consists in the following:

It was adjudged by the
conviction, as appears by the warrant of commitment, that Stewart should be
imprisoned for the term of six months, and it was also adjudged that he should
forfeit and pay the sum of $100 to be paid and applied according to law; and it
was further adjudged that, in default of payment of the said sum, Stewart
should be imprisoned

for a further term of two
months, unless the said sum of $100 and the costs and charges of conveying
(him) to the said common gaol should be sooner paid.

The operative part of the warrant
of commitment is in the same terms, except that the keeper is commanded also to
exact "" the costs and charges of the commitment"", in addition to
those "" of the conveying "", before he discharges the prisoner.

Under section 176 (d) of the Excise
Act , the offence of which Stewart was found guilty is an indictable offence
(though triable by summary conviction-s. 127 ) and made him liable to a penalty

not exceeding $2,000, and
not less than two hundred dollars, and to imprisonment, with or without hard
labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month,
and, in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment
not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months.

As will have been perceived, the
absolute order of imprisonment for a term of six months is within the
limitation contained in the enactment. Stewart is now detained in

[Page 58]

gaol under a perfectly good award
of imprisonment and the commitment, as well as the conviction, is a legal and
sufficient warrant for the gaoler to keep him in prison.

There seems to be no doubt
however that the magistrate had no power to impose less than the minimum fine
or to order imprisonment, in default of payment of fine and cos's, for a term
shorter than prescribed by the statute.

According to the Interpretation
Act (c. 1 of R.S.C. 1927, s. 28)

Every Act shall be read and
construed as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by
indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to,
were described or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on
summary conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the
Criminal Code  relating to indictable offence, or offences, as the case may be,
shall apply to every such offence.

By force of sections 1028  and
1029  of the Criminal Code  the magistrate had no discretion to inflict a
punishment or to award a fine or a penalty outside the limitations contained in
s. 176  (e) of the Excise Act . And section 1054 of the same code
provides

that no one shall be
sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

I think therefore that the
conviction for a fine of $100 and the adjudication of imprisonment for a
further term of two months, in default of payment of the fine and costs, were
bad and illegal.

Had Stewart, at the present time,
been kept in gaol because of his failure to pay the fine of $100 and costs, I
would not however have maintained the writ of habeas corpus. Applying
section 1120 of the Criminal Code , I would have made an order for the further
detention of Stewart and have directed the magistrate, under whose warrant he
is in custody,

to do such further act as
*** may best further the ends of justice.

And it may not be out of place to
draw the attention of the petitioner to the fact that by s. 1125  of the
Criminal Code ,

the punishment imposed being
less than the punishment by law assigned to the offence stated in the
conviction or order

is treated as an irregularity
which may be dealt with in all respects as the court may do upon appeal under
section

[Page 59]

754 of the Code. Section 1125  has
reference to convictions removed by certiorari, but there is no apparent
reason why an order to a similar effect could not be made on habeas corpus
under s. 1120 of the code.

I am not however so deciding. In
my reasons for judgment on the similar petitions of John Henderson and George
Broder, I have explained why I thought that the conviction as made in this case
was severable. It consists first in an absolute order for the payment of a
fine. By the terms of the conviction and of the warrant, the term of two
months, in default of payment of the fine, is "" to commence (only) at the
expiration of "" the absolute term of imprisonment of six months. The
conviction and warrant are dated the 5th day of January, 1929. The six months
will expire only on the 5th day of July. In the meantime and at present a valid
case of detention is shewn, the petitioner is legally in gaol and he cannot
succeed in his present application. The application is therefore dismissed.

In re Joe Go Get

Joe Go Get, was, on the 23rd
January, 1929, convicted before Thos. McClymont, a police magistrate, for that
he

did have in his possession a
drug, to wit prepared opium, without lawful authority, contrary to the
provisions of section 4 (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,
1923, and amendments thereto.

He was adjudged to be imprisoned
for the term of six months. He was also adjudged to forfeit and pay the sum of
$200, and he was further adjudged, if the said sum was not sooner paid, to be
imprisoned

for the additional space of
three months to commence at and from the expiration of the term of imprisonment
aforesaid.

Joe Go Get was imprisoned under a
warrant of commitment reciting the above conviction and now applies for his
release from custody by habeas corpus. He says his conviction, as
appears by the commitment, is incomplete and in improper form and contrary to
the Opium and Narcotic Act because:

1. The penalty imposed is less
than the minimum penalty which may be awarded under the Act.

2. There is no adjudication as to
costs, which is necessary in such an offence.

3. The conviction and warrant of
commitment do not "" provide for costs and charges of commitment.""

[Page 60]

The offence of which Joe Go Get
was found guilty is covered by section 4 (d) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, which made him liable

upon summary conviction, to
imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding eighteen
months

and not less than six months, and
to a fine not exceeding

one thousand dollars and
costs and not less than two hundred dollars and coss.

Then paragraph 2 of section 4
says:

2. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the Criminal Code , or of any other statute or law, the court
shall have no power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein
prescribed, and shall, in all cases of conviction, impose both fine and
imprisonment; * * *

In the present case, no objection
is taken to the absolute term of imprisonment imposed, but the sum ordered to
be forfeited and paid as a fine is only two hundred dollars, and it is argued
that this was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of the magistrate because,
under the Act, the fine may not be less than two hundred dollars and costs. The
conclusion would be that either a fine for the minimum amount without costs is
below the penalty imperatively prescribed or that the conviction is bad because
it contains no adjudication as to costs.

I do not so understand the
statute, and I read it as Murphy J. did in Rex v. Wong Yet [23].

Section 4 (2) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act must be applied

notwithstanding the
provision of the Criminal Code , or of any other statute or law.

For the determination of this
objection, I must therefore look only to the provisions of the Act. The Act
says that

the court shall have no
power to impose less than the minimum penalties herein prescribed.

I think the word "" penalties
"" means the fine and the imprisonment and does not include the costs. The
magistrate

shall, in all cases of
conviction, impose both fine and imprisonment.

He may not impose a fine alone,
or an imprisonment alone. He must not impose a term of imprisonment or a fine
outside the limitations contained in the enactment, but the costs remain in his
discretion. Applying this interpretation to the wording of the relevant section
4d (b), I would say that the magistrate could, as he has done in this case,
impose a fine of $200, without speaking of the costs. The

[Page 61]

words "" not less than ""
in the section apply to the "" fine "" only; and the "" fine ""
does not comprise "" the costs."" This is shown by section twelve of
the Act, whereby when "" the conviction adjudges payment of a
fine,"" the sentence may direct that in default of payment of the fine

and costs, the person so convicted shall be imprisoned until
such fine and costs are paid, etc.

The limitation in s. 4 applies
therefore to the penalties, being the imprisonment and the fine, but not to the
total amount of fine and costs. The object of the enactment "" according to
its true intent, meaning and spirit "" is that the minimum fine may be
imposed, outside of the costs.

Nor do I think that an
adjudication as to costs is necessary for such an offence. There is no
provision making it so. The effect of section 4d (b) even were I to put
upon it the construction suggested by counsel for the petitioner, would not be
that costs must be ordered to be paid by the person found guilty, it would be
that the combined amounts of fine and costs may not be less than $200, a result
which to my mind only goes to strengthen the view I have expressed on the first
ground of this application.

Outside of section 4d (b),
no other sections of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act were pointed to me
compelling the magistrate to award costs. In such a case the provisions of the
Criminal Code  apply (Interpretation Act, s. 28, c. 1 of R.S.C., 1927).

In summary matters under the
Criminal Code , costs are in the discretion of the magistrate (s. 735 ) and, as
said by my brother Mr. Justice Duff in the Marino case (22nd August,
1927, not reported), I cannot

assume that the police
magistrate did not judicially consider and pass upon that question.

What I have just said also
applies to the costs and charges of commitment. I may add that I fail to see
what interest the petitioner may have of complaining on habeas corpus
that the warrant of commitment makes no mention whatever of those costs. The
only effect is that he will not have to pay them in order to escape restraint
of liberty.

The application is dismissed
without costs.

The appeal from the above
judgments was heard by the court, composed of four judges (s. 28 (2), Supreme
Court Act), on June 13, 1929.

Stuart Henderson for the
appellants.

J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the Attorney General for British Columbia.

P. D. Wilson for the Minister of Justice and the Minister of
National Revenue.

On June 14, 1929, the court
delivered its judgment affirming the judgments of Rinfret J.

THE COURT.—In the cases of Henderson,
Broder and Joe Go Get, the warrant of commitment shews a valid conviction, and
even assuming it to be defective because the amount of the costs is not stated,
that would not be a ground for discharging the prisoners on habeas corpus :
Section 1121 , Criminal Code . It is not necessary to express any opinion on the
question of severance. The appeals are dismissed.

In the Stewart case, assuming the
defects alleged on behalf of the prisoner, he is not at present held under any
of the defective clauses. The statute clearly contemplates that the proceedings
are not wholly void, for there are curative provisions which, in the meantime,
may be invoked. If these are not available to this court, they may nevertheless
conveniently be resorted to elsewhere, and, in the interests of justice, it
seems right that the Crown should not be deprived of its judicial remedies.

We think therefore that this
application is at best premature, and should be dismissed.

Appeals
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Evidence—Tender of evidence
given on former trial, under Cr. C., s. 999—Admission by accused’s counsel of
“every fact essential to the admission of the evidence” under s. 999—Extent of
admission—Lack of proof that evidence put in was in fact the evidence given at
former trial—Materiality of the evidence as affecting findings against
accused—New trial—Warning to jury where evidence tendered under s. 999 which
was given on former separate trials of persons now tried together.

The appellants were convicted of removing,
and two of them of importing, goods of over $200 in value and liable to
forfeiture, contrary to s. 193 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42.
At their trial the Crown proposed to put in, under s. 999 of the Cr. Code, evidence
given at previous trials (at which the juries had disagreed) by one W. Counsel
for the accused admitted “every fact essential to the admission of the evidence
of [W.] under s. 999 of the Code,” and the evidence offered was put in.

Held: The
admission of counsel, while it rendered unnecessary the establishment of the
various facts required by s. 999 to be proved before the evidence of W. could
have been admitted, did not in any way identify the documents read to the jury
as the evidence given by W. on the former trials; and, there being no proof
that the statements put in were in fact the evidence of W., and there being no
consent that they were, they were wrongly received, and appellants were
entitled to a new trial. The appellant C, convicted of removing but not of
importing, was so entitled, notwithstanding that the depositions put in did not
in terms incriminate him; they were important on the point that the goods in
question were goods liable to forfeiture under the Act; that was an essential
element of the charge and of the proof, and although C. might have been
connected with it only through other evidence, it was not possible to
appreciate how far the depositions on the main charge concerning the character
of the goods imported might have influenced the jury in its findings.

The said previous trials had been, one of the
appellant O. alone, and the other of the other appellants and one P. On the
trial in question, at which said depositions were received, they were all tried
together. One alleged ground for a new trial was that W.’s evidence on either
previous trial was inadmissible against any accused who had not been a
defendant on the previous trial at which it was given. The Court found it
unnecessary to pass upon the point, but remarked that, should similar
circumstances happen at the next trial, and W.’s depositions properly and
legally identified be tendered, it would be most

[Page 570]

advisable for the trial judge to warn the jury
that each deposition should be considered as evidence only against the accused
in whose former trial such deposition purported to have been taken.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia in banco, sitting as a Court of Appeal under the
provisions of the Criminal Code , dismissing the appeals of the present
appellants from their convictions for violation of s. 193 of the Customs
Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42.

The three appellants and one Petrie were
tried together before Ross J. with a jury on an indictment containing three
counts, the charges being that they, at Sydney in the County of Cape Breton, on
or about the 3rd September, 1929, did knowingly and unlawfully, and without
lawful excuse, assist, or were otherwise concerned in, (1) unshipping goods,
(2) the importing of goods, (3) landing or removing goods; to wit (in each
case): spirituous liquors over the value of $200 which said goods were liable
to forfeiture under the Customs Act , contrary to the provisions of s.
193 , c. 42, R.S.C., 1927, and amendments thereto.

The jury found the appellants McDonald and
O’Hearn guilty on the second count (importing) and all three appellants guilty
on the third count (removing). They found Petrie not guilty. The appellants
were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, Conter for two years under the third
count, and McDonald and O’Hearn for two years under each of the second and
third counts, such sentences to run concurrently. Petrie was acquitted.

It appeared that at a previous sittings of
the court, O’Hearn had been tried alone, and McDonald, Conter and Petrie had
been tried together, and there were disagreements by both juries; that at each
of those trials one Captain Wheeler had given evidence; and that he was now
absent from Canada. At the present trial it was proposed by the prosecution to
put in the evidence given by Captain Wheeler at the previous trials, under s.
999  of the Criminal Code , which reads as follows:

If upon the trial of an accused person such
facts are proved upon oath or affirmation that it can be reasonably inferred
therefrom that any person, whose evidence was given at any former trial upon
the same charge, or whose deposition has been theretofore taken in the
investigation of the charge against such accused person, is dead, or so ill as
not to be able to travel, or is absent from Canada, or if such person refuses
to be sworn

[Page 571]

or to give evidence, and if it is proved that
such evidence was given or such deposition was taken in the presence of the
person accused, and that he or his counsel or solicitor if present had a full
opportunity of cross-examining the witness, then if the evidence or deposition
purports to be signed by the judge or justice before whom the same purports to
have been taken, it shall be read as evidence in the prosecution, without
further proof thereof, unless it is proved that such evidence or deposition was
not in fact signed by the judge or justice purporting to have signed the same.

Counsel for the accused made an admission in
the following form

[Names of counsel] admit every fact essential
to the admission of the evidence of Captain Wheeler under section 999 of the Code.

and the evidence offered was put in.

Appeals taken from the convictions were
dismissed by the Court of Appeal, Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting, and,
pursuant to order of the Court, pronouncing separate judgments.

The judgment of the majority of the court was
delivered by Harris C.J. He held that the admission of counsel, on its face and
as understood at the trial, meant that the evidence of Wheeler was to be
admitted against all the defendants; that the authorities show that the consent
of the accused or his counsel is binding in such cases; and the evidence of
Wheeler given on the two previous trials was properly received and binding on
all the defendants. He further stated:

We think it is proper to point out that the
suggestion that the admission of the evidence was only intended to be for the
purpose of making it available as against the particular defendant or
defendants who had been on trial on the previous occasion is not in our opinion
the meaning of the admission which contains no such limitation.

If that view had been maintainable it would
have involved a consideration of various questions and among others as to what
if any difference there was between the evidence of Captain Wheeler in the two
cases and whether or not these differences affected all or any of the issues.
It was strongly argued that these differences were immaterial and it was
pointed out that even if they were material, none of Wheeler’s evidence
affected the question of the guilt, if any, of the accused under the third
count of the indictment. The guilt of all the accused under that count was
clearly established by other evidence and was in no way affected by the admission
of Wheeler’s evidence. This seems to be so, and as the same punishment was
awarded upon each of the convictions to run concurrently it seems to follow
that no injustice would have been done any of the prisoners even if we had
reached a different conclusion as to the effect of the admission of Captain
Wheeler’s evidence.

[Page 572]

Another objection raised was that none of the
evidence taken on the two previous trials purported to be signed by the Judge,
but that objection is obviously covered by the admission of counsel.

The grounds of dissent of Mellish J. were
“that the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter
and Petrie was inadmissible in this trial as evidence against O’Hearn,” and
“that the evidence given by Wheeler in the previous trial of O’Hearn was
inadmissible in this trial as against Conter, McDonald and Petrie;” that s. 999 
of the Criminal Code  is clearly intended to deal with evidence given on
the former trial of the same defendant and the admission of counsel aforesaid
was therefore “wholly insufficient to allow of the reception of evidence taken
on the previous trial of one party as against a different party on a later
trial;” further, that “there is no proof that the statements put in were in
fact the evidence of Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.”
Carroll J. concurred with the reasons of Mellish J., and added some further
reasons, including the ground (in connection with s. 999 ) that the evidence was
not signed by the judge “before whom the same purports to have been taken;”
that this fact of non-signature, apart from all other considerations, made all
this evidence non-admissible.

By the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada, now reported, the appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered as regards
the three appellants.

J. W. Maddin K.C. and M. A. Patterson for
the appellants.

D. A. Cameron K.C. for the respondent.

The Court.—In our opinion one ground upon which the appellants are entitled
to a new trial is that taken by Mellish J., in his dissenting judgment, namely,
that there is no proof that “the statements put in were in fact the evidence of
Captain Wheeler and there is no consent that they were.” The admission of
counsel for the appellants rendered unnecessary the establishment, by the
prosecution, of the various facts required by section 999 of the Code to be
proved before the evidence of Captain Wheeler could have been admitted, but
that admission did not, in any way, identify the document which was read to the
jury, as the evidence given by him on the former trial.

[Page 573]

It is true that the deposition of Captain
Wheeler, as admitted, does not, in terms, incriminate the appellant Conter. The
deposition is, however, very important on the point that the goods which the
appellants were charged with having assisted or having been otherwise concerned
in importing, unshipping, landing or removing were goods liable to forfeiture
under the Customs Act ; that was an essential element of the charge and
of the proof, and although Conter may have been connected with it only through
other evidence, it is not possible to appreciate how far the depositions of
Captain Wheeler on the main charge concerning the character of the goods
imported may have influenced the jury in its findings.

Our view on the above point makes it unnecessary
to pass upon the other ground of dissent, to wit: “that the evidence given by
Wheeler in the previous trial of McDonald, Conter and Petrie was inadmissible
in this trial as evidence against O’Hearn” and “that the evidence given by
Wheeler in the previous trial of O’Hearn was inadmissible in this trial as
against Conter, McDonald and Petrie.” We wish only to add that, should similar
circumstances happen at the next trial and Wheeler’s deposition properly and
legally identified be tendered, it would be most advisable for the trial judge
to warn the jury that each deposition should be considered as evidence only
against the accused in whose former trial such deposition purported to have
been taken.

The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered
as regards the three appellants.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
 ALBERTA

Criminal law—Charge of robbery with violence—Sufficiency of
evidence to justify conviction—Alleged misdirection in charge to jury.

[Page 143]

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1]
dismissing (Hyndman J.A. dissenting) their appeal from their conviction, at a
trial before Tweedie J. and a jury, of the crime charged against them, namely,
robbery with violence.

The grounds urged on behalf of the appellants on the appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada were:1 that there was no evidence to justify
the conviction of the accused for the crime charged; and (2) that the trial
judge did not properly charge the jury with regard to the evidence of Eva
Rosychuk.

On conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellants,
and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the Court orally delivered
judgment dismissing the appeal; being of opinion that there was evidence
sufficient to warrant the jury in inferring that the accused were guilty of the
crime charged; and that there was no misdirection by the trial judge with
regard to the evidence of the witness Eva Rosychuk; that, while perhaps he did
not go into that evidence as fully as he might have done, yet he went into it
quite as fully as was necessary and described it fairly in what he said of it;
that no wrong was done the accused in this connection.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Trial—Withdrawal of case from jury—Action
for damages for alleged negligence, as being responsible for death of defendant’s
employee— Plaintiff non-suited at trial—Judgment of Court of Appeal ordering
new trial, affirmed.

APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1]. The
action was brought under the Fatal Accidents Act of Saskatchewan, for
damages for the death of an employee of the defendant, it being alleged that
the deceased came to his death owing to negligence of the defendant, its
agents, officers or employees. At the trial Maclean J. granted the defendant’s
application for non-suit, withdrew the case from the

[Page 174]

jury, and dismissed the action. The Court of
Appeal (1) allowed the plaintiff’s appeal from the judgment of Maclean J., and
ordered a new trial. The defendant appealed to this Court.

At the conclusion of the argument for the
appellant, and without calling on counsel for the respondent, the judgment of
the Court was orally delivered by the Chief Justice, dismissing the appeal with
costs; holding that the Court could not say that the jury would not have been
justified, by drawing inferences from the facts in evidence, in making findings
as to how the deceased met his death and whether or not it was caused by
negligence of the defendant. The Court pointed out that it did not pass upon
the question of the admissibility of the evidence contained in Steeper’s
examination for discovery, as to which it had not heard argument; and that, of
course, it must not be understood even to suggest that upon the evidence now in
the record the plaintiff should succeed; all it determined was that the Court
of Appeal was right in holding that the case should not have been withdrawn
from the jury.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Conviction on charge
of receiving stolen goods—Evidence of statements made by the thieves in
presence of accused——Misdirection in judge’s charge to jury—Contention that no
miscarriage of Justice (Cr. Code, a. 1014 (2)).

The accused was convicted on a charge of
receiving stolen goods, knowing them to have been stolen. At his trial,
evidence was admitted of statements made in his presence by the supposed
thieves to a constable. In charging the jury, the judge referred to these
statements as evidence that might be regarded, but warned them of the danger of
accepting evidence of accomplices without corroboration. On objection by
accused’s counsel to the charge, he recalled the jury and said: “I have already
warned you in this case it would be most dangerous for you to rely on (the
thieves’) evidence as against the prisoner without feeling it was corroborated
in other respects because (of) what they said (when) the prisoner was there. He
did not express any particular assent to it and you should reasonably be bound
by what he did assent to and I think on the whole it is almost worthless
evidence for you.”

Held: The
conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered, on the ground of
misdirection. It is only when the accused, by “word or conduct, action or
demeanour,” has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so,
that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary
value; and there was no evidence from which a jury might infer anything in the
nature of an admission by accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating in
the statements in question. The jury should have been told that, in the absence
of any assent by the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of
the statements, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and
should be entirely disregarded. It was impossible to say that there had been no
miscarriage of justice, and apply s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code ; it
may be that sometimes objectionable testimony as to which there has been
misdirection is so unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the
view that in all human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury’s
mind, and, on that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict (Kelly v.
R. 54  Can. S.C.R. 220); but here, in a most vital matter, the judge had
not only failed to warn the jury to disregard the statements, but had actually
stressed them, in that he in effect told the jury that they were “evidence”
upon which, if corroborated, they might act.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
(37 Man. R. 367) reversed.

APPEAL on behalf of the accused from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1]
affirming (Fullerton J.A. dissenting) his conviction at trial before Galt J.
with a jury, for the offences of unlawfully receiving and of unlawfully
retaining stolen goods, knowing same to have been stolen.

The grounds of appeal were: insufficiency of
evidence on which a jury could convict, wrongful admission of evidence, and
misdirection in the trial judge’s charge to the jury.

At the trial the Crown called as a witness
one Alexander, a detective, who, in the course of his evidence, deposed that,
after the accused was arrested, he confronted him with the two men (one after
the other) who had been charged with the theft of the goods in question, that
(after giving the usual caution to these men and to the accused) he had
questioned these men in the accused’s presence; and what was said on that
occasion (of which Alexander took notes at the time) was given by Alexander in
evidence, counsel for the accused objecting to its admissibility. On the appeal
it was contended (inter alia) on behalf of the accused that that
evidence should not have been admitted, and that the statements made by the
said two men on the occasion in question, to which the accused had not
assented, were, in the trial judge’s charge to the jury, wrongfully assumed to
be evidence against the accused.

On the ground of misdirection in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury, this Court allowed the accused’s appeal, set aside
the conviction, and ordered a new trial. Portions of the judge’s charge to
which this Court made special reference are set out in the judgment now
reported.

J. M. Isaacs for
the appellant.

J. Allen K.C. for
the respondent.

Argument by counsel for the appellant on the
ground of misdirection was stopped by the Court, but he was directed to
proceed, if so advised, on the other ground of his appeal, namely: that there
were not sufficient evidence of identification of the goods alleged to have
been stolen. Counsel

[Page 555]

representing the Attorney General was informed
that he might confine his answer to the questions of misdirection and whether
substantial wrong or miscarriage had resulted therefrom.

On the conclusion of the argument, the judgment
of the court was rendered by

Anglin C.J.C.—We are all of opinion that the conviction cannot stand. There
was clearly misdirection by the learned trial judge on a very important and
most material matter.

Certain statements made in the presence of the
accused by the supposed thieves to a constable (Alexander) were deposed to by
the latter. In reference to these statements, and after reading at length to
the jury the evidence pertinent thereto given by Alexander, the learned trial
judge said:

That’s the interview that was mentioned to
you by Alexander, and as I said before you must accept that evidence. Bear in
mind it is very dangerous to accept the evidence of accomplices like these
fellows unless you feel satisfied it corresponds with the truth as told by
other witnesses;

and again

In the 9th volume of Halsbury it states: To
prove that the goods were stolen, a confession by the thief is admissible; if
it was made in the prisoner’s presence, but not otherwise. * * * The thief is
an admissible witness but the alleged receiver should not be convicted on his
evidence alone without corroboration.

But for the introductory allusion to the
Alexander interview, all this might be taken to have reference to the testimony
given orally by Paulin and Webster at the trial, which, however, was markedly
less incriminating for the accused than were their answers to Alexander in the
interview related by him—and the learned judge may have so intended these
observations. Moreover, on objection being taken by the prisoner’s counsel,
citing R. v. Christie[2],
counsel for the Crown replied:

Rex v. Christie
lays down this, that where a statement is made in the presence of the
accused it is admissible in evidence, but in instructing the jury on the
Statute (sic), your Lordship must point out that what is contained in
the statement is not evidence unless it is admitted.

The learned judge thereupon recalled the jury
and said to them:

Objections are being raised by Mr. Isaacs
(to) the evidence that has been put in by these two thieves, who did steal
coats from Eatons. I have

[Page 556]

already warned you in this case it would be
most dangerous for you to rely on their evidence as against the prisoner
without feeling it was corroborated in other respects because (of) what they
said (when) the prisoner was there. He did not express any particular assent to
it and you should reasonably be bound by what he did assent to and I think on
the whole it is almost worthless evidence for you.

This is very far indeed from telling the jury,
as the learned judge should have done, that, in the absence of any assent by
the accused either by word or conduct to the correctness of the statements made
in his presence, they had no evidentiary value whatever as against him and
should be entirely disregarded.

Counsel representing the Attorney General at bar
admitted that in his original direction the trial judge had failed to
appreciate the rule laid down in Christie’s Case[3], but argued that he had corrected this
error when the jury was recalled. We think he rather accentuated it, however,
by again referring to the statements as “evidence” susceptible of
corroboration.

It has been urged that this misdirection did not
cause a miscarriage of justice and that s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code , therefore,
applies. That subject has been ably dealt with in a recent article on “Evidence”
by Dr. D. A. MacRae, a professor in the Law School at Osgoode Hall, published
in the Fourth Volume of the Canadian Encyclopaedic Digest, Ontario Edition,
which reviews all the leading decisions. In section 17, at p. 405, referring to
the Makin Case[4], the
writer points out (notes “x” and “y”) that Lord Herschell, in delivering the
judgment of the Privy Council, said:

The evidence improperly admitted might have
chiefly influenced the jury to return a verdict of guilty, and the rest of the
evidence which might appear to the court sufficient to support the conviction
might have been reasonably disbelieved by the jury. * * * Their Lordships do
not think it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of
the accused the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge
to consider in arriving at their verdict matters which ought not to have been
submitted to them. In their Lordships’ opinion substantial wrong would be done
to the accused if he were deprived of the verdict of a jury on the facts proved
by legal evidence, and there were substituted for it the verdict of the court
founded merely upon a perusal of the evidence.

[Page 557]

Dr. MacRae also quotes from the judgment of the
Privy

Council, delivered by Lord Sumner, in Ibrahim
v. R.[5]:

Where the trial judge has warned the jury
not to act upon the objectionable evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal * * *
may refuse to interfere, if it thinks that the jury, giving heed to that
warning, would have returned the same verdict * * * or where evidence has been
admitted inadvertently or erroneously, which is inadmissible but of small
importance * * * or most unlikely to have affected the verdict. * * * Where the
objectionable evidence has been left for the consideration of the jury without
any warning to disregard it, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashes the
conviction, if it thinks that the jury may have been influenced by it, even
though without it there was evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction.

The present provision of the Criminal Code  of
Canada (s. 1014 (2)) is substantially the same as that dealt with in the Makin
Case[6], and in
Ibrahim v. R[7]. This
Court had, in the Allen Case[8],
already taken the same view of the effect of the former section 1019  of the
Criminal Code  and, since the substitution for it in 1923 of s. 1014 (2)  in its
present form, the statement of the law made in the earlier case (Allen v.
The King8) was reaffirmed in Gouin v. The
King[9].

It is impossible to say that in the case now
before us there has been no miscarriage of justice. It may be that sometimes
objectionable testimony as to which there has been misdirection is so
unimportant that the court would be justified in taking the view that in all
human probability it could have had no effect upon the jury’s mind, and, on
that ground, in refusing to set aside the verdict. (Kelly v. R.[10]. But it is impossible so to regard this
case, where, in a most vital matter, the learned judge did not merely fail to
warn the jury to disregard the objectionable matter contained in the statements
which had been admitted in evidence, but actually stressed it. It is only when
the accused by “word or conduct, action or demeanour” has accepted what they
contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other
persons in his presence have any evidentiary value. In the present case there
is no evidence in the record from which a jury might infer anything in the
nature of an admission by the accused of the accuracy of what was incriminating
in the statements

[Page 558]

of the thieves given in evidence by Alexander.
When the jury was recalled, the learned trial judge, far from telling them, as
Crown Counsel had suggested was the course indicated in Christie’s Case[11], that the statements in question had no
evidentiary value in the absence of some such admission by the accused, in
effect told them that they were “evidence” upon which they might act, if
corroborated, inasmuch as he said to them that it would be dangerous for them
to rely upon such evidence as against the prisoner “without feeling that it was
corroborated.”

On this ground we are of opinion that the appeal
must succeed.

As to the other ground taken by Mr. Isaacs, we
are clearly of the view that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury
and that, if there had been a proper direction as to the statements so much
discussed, the attack upon the conviction must have failed.

As in the recent cases of Brooks v. The
King[12], and Hubin
v. The King[13], “the
circumstances do not seem to call for an unqualified order quashing the
conviction and directing the discharge of the appellant.” On the contrary, we
think it clear that our discretion “should be exercised in such a manner as to
afford the Crown an opportunity of once more putting the law in motion.” R. v.
Burr[14].

The conviction will, accordingly, be set aside
and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed, conviction set aside and
new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment containing three
counts, charging: manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); causing grievous bodily injury
(Cr. C., s. 284); and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, etc.,
of motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285)—Acquittal on first two counts, and conviction
on third count—Joinder of counts—Right of jury to find guilty on third count,
while finding not guilty on other counts.

The appellant was tried on an indictment
containing three counts (referring to the same occurrence), viz., (1)
manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 268); (2) causing grievous bodily injury (Cr. C., s.
284); and (3)

[Page 43]

causing bodily harm by wanton or furious
driving, etc., of a motor vehicle (Cr. C., s. 285). The jury found him not
guilty on the first and second counts, but guilty on the third count. From the
affirmance by the Appellate Division, Ont., of his conviction on the third
count, he appealed, on the ground that, as the facts upon which the three counts
were based were the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was not
open to the jury, after acquitting him upon the first two counts, to convict
him upon the third.

Held: It was
open to the jury to find as they did. It was permissible to join the other
counts to the first one charging manslaughter (Cr. C., s. 856). Whether the
three counts should be tried together was in the discretion of the trial judge
(Cr. C., s. 857). Had appellant been charged only with manslaughter, but so
described as to include the offences charged in the said second and third
counts, then, under s. 951, Cr. C., he could properly have been convicted of
either of these latter offences, as “other offences” the commission of which
was included in the offence “as charged in the count,” if, in the jury’s
opinion, “the whole offence charged was not proved.” (R. v. Shea, 14
Can. Cr. Cas. 319, if it
implies the contrary, overruled). In the case at bar, that the jury had found
that the whole offence charged either in the first count or in the second count
had not been proved, was an intendment which must be made in support of the
verdict; and it was within the jury’s province so to find, while finding that
the offence charged in the third count was proved; and it was not open to this Court
to consider the evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the
jury, as reasonable men, could have negatived the existence of any element
necessary to constitute either of the offences charged in the first and second
counts, consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count.

R. v. Forseille,
35 Can. Crim. Cas. 171,
overruled.

Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., (35
Ont. W.N. 172; Middleton J.A. dissenting) affirmed.

Smith J. dissented, agreeing with the
dissenting judgment of Middleton J.A., in the Appellate Division, and with the
judgment in R. v. Forseille, and holding that, where injuries
have been caused by the accused to a deceased person (as found in this case)
and these injuries have caused the death, as was unquestionably so in this
case, counts under ss. 284 and 285, Cr. C., should not be allowed to go to the
jury; an acquittal on the charge of manslaughter is necessarily a finding that
there was no criminal negligence, which negligence is necessary to constitute a
crime under ss. 284 and 285.

APPEAL by the defendant under
section 1023, and, by leave of Lamont J., under section 1025  of the Criminal
Code , from the affirmance of his conviction by the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court of Ontario, Mr. Justice Middleton dissenting[1].

The question raised is whether, as was decided
by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[2]

[Page 44]

when an accused is tried on a charge containing
two counts, one for manslaughter and the other for causing grievous bodily
harm, the second count should not be allowed to go to the jury; and, a jury
having found him not guilty of manslaughter but convicted him on such second
count, the conviction must be quashed.

In the case at bar the appellant was acquitted
on the first two counts and was convicted on the third count in the following
indictment:

1. That [he] at the Township of Sandwich
East, in the County of Essex, on the sixteenth day of September, 1928, did
unlawfully kill and slay one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to section 268 
of the Criminal Code .

2. That [he, at the place and on the date
aforesaid] by an unlawful act, or by doing negligently or omitting to do an act
which it was his duty to do, did cause grievous bodily injury to one, Albert J.
Strockean, contrary to section 284  of the Criminal Code .

3. That [he, at the place and on the date
aforesaid] having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton or furious driving or
racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, did cause or caused
to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean, contrary to
section 285  of the Criminal Code .

As authorized by subs. 5 of s. 1013  of the Criminal
Code , Middleton, J.A., adverting to the view to the same effect which he
had expressed in R. v. Stark[3]
delivered a dissenting judgment, avowedly to enable the appellant to appeal as
of right to this Court. The sole ground of this dissent is expressed in these
terms:

This case seems to me to be one well
illustrating the difficulty resulting from what I humbly think is a departure
from sound principle. The unfortunate victim was undoubtedly killed as the
result of the accident. If his death was the result of the fault of the
accused, the crime was manslaughter. He has been acquitted and as the death and
the fact that the death resulted from the accident are not disputed, the
finding of not guilty can only mean that in the opinion of the jury the death
was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.

Similarly the finding of not guilty on the
second count, that of causing grievous bodily harm, must mean that in the
opinion of the jury the bodily harm unquestionably sustained by the deceased
was not caused by the misconduct of the accused.

The finding of guilt on the third count
must, in the light of the finding on the other counts, mean that the jury
understood that it had the right to find this man guilty of the lesser offence
while acquitting him of the only offence of which it was open to them to find
him guilty upon the evidence.

[Page 45]

The only relevant ground of appeal to the Appellate Divisional Court is thus stated
in the judgment of the majority of that Court delivered by Orde, J.A.:

That, as the facts upon which the three
counts are based are the same as to each of the three offences charged, it was
not open to the jury after acquitting the accused upon the first two counts, to
convict him upon the third.

After alluding to the fact that the Appellate Divisional Court had in the Stark
case[4]
declined to follow the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Forseille[5], Orde, J.A., proceeds:

It may be difficult to understand how upon
the evidence in a particular case a jury could come to the conclusion that the
accused had by his negligence done bodily harm to another and at the same time
acquit him of manslaughter. But it is not open to us in my opinion to approach
the matter in that way. The question is one of law simply, and I can see no
legal reason for saying that a verdict of guilty of doing bodily harm is bad
because upon the same state of facts the Appellate Court, not the jury, thinks
it ought to have convicted the accused of manslaughter.

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are
as follows:

856. Any number of counts for any offences
whatever may be joined in the same indictment, and shall be distinguished in
the manner shown in form 63, or to the like effect: Provided that to a count
charging murder no count charging any offence other than murder shall be
joined.

857. When there are more counts than one in
an indictment each count may be treated as a separate indictment.

2. If the court thinks it conducive to the
ends of justice to do so, it may direct that the accused shall be tried upon
any one or more of such counts separately: Provided that, unless there be
special reasons, no order shall be made preventing the trial at the same time
of any number of distinct charges of theft, not exceeding three, alleged to
have been committed within six months from the first to the last of such
offences, whether against the same person or not.

898. Every objection to any indictment for
any defect apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer, or motion
to quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards,
except by leave of the court or judge before whom the trial takes place, and every
court before which any such objection is taken may, if it is thought necessary,
cause the indictment to be forthwith amended in such particular, by some
officer of the court or other person, and thereupon the trial shall proceed as
if no such defect had appeared.

2. No motion in arrest of judgment shall be
allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage
of by demurrer, or amended under the authority of this Act.

907. On the trial of an issue on a plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict to any count or counts, if it appear
that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on the former trial is
the same in whole or in part as that on which it is proposed to give him in
charge, and that he

[Page 46]

might on the former trial, if all proper
amendments had been made which might then have been made, have been convicted
of all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count or counts to
which such plea is pleaded, the court shall give judgment that he be discharged
from such count or counts.

2. If it appear that the accused might on
the former trial have been convicted of any offence of which he might be
convicted on the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, but that he may
be convicted on any such count or counts of some offence or offences of which
he could not have been convicted on the former trial, the court shall direct
that he shall not be convicted on any such count or counts of any offence of
which he might have been convicted on the former trial, but that he shall plead
over as to the other offence or offences charged.

951. Every count shall be deemed divisible;
and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment
creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any
other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included
which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be
convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

2. On a count charging murder, if the
evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that
count find the accused guilty of any other offence.

S.W. Springsteen for the appellant.

E. Bayly, K.C., for the respondent.

After hearing counsel for the appellant and the
Court having retired for consideration of his argument, the Chief Justice,
without calling on counsel for the respondent, announced that a majority of the
Court was of the opinion that the appeal failed and should be dismissed.

Subsequently the following reasons for judgment
were delivered.

The judgment of the majority of the Court
(Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by

ANGLIN, C.J.C.—The only question open on this
appeal is whether in law it was competent to the jury to convict the accused on
the third count of the indictment while finding him not guilty on the first and
second counts. No ground of appeal involving a question of fact, or mixed fact
and law can be considered here (s. 1023, Cr. C.). Whatever the evidence may
disclose, all findings or intendments of fact necessary to support the verdict
must now be made. Thus, it must be assumed that the jury, while it found that
the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused while

[Page 47]

having charge of a motor vehicle, by wanton
or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect,
did cause or caused to be done, bodily harm to one Albert J. Strockean,
contrary to Section 285  of the Criminal Code .

nevertheless deemed such evidence insufficient
to warrant a finding that some other elements or ingredients necessary to
constitute either of the offences charged in the two other counts of the indictment,
on which they returned a verdict of not guilty, were also proven. Especially
must this be the case when, as here, the trial judge had correctly instructed
the jury as to what constituted each of the two offences of which they
acquitted the accused.

While, sitting here and considering the evidence
as reported, we may find it difficult to appreciate how the jury, finding that
the accused by doing an unlawful act had caused bodily harm to Strockean,
could, death having ensued, acquit him of manslaughter, we cannot give effect
to such a view without invading the realm of fact, which is closed to us by the
statute.

Having regard to the provisions of s. 856  of the
Criminal Code , and notably to the proviso thereto, it was, in our
opinion, clearly permissible for the Crown to join counts nos. 2 and 3 to the
first count charging manslaughter. Whether the three counts should be tried
together was in the discretion of the trial judge (s. 857 , Cr.C .).

Under s. 951, had the accused been charged only
with manslaughter, but so described as to include the offences charged in
counts nos. 2 and 3 of the indictment now fore us, he could properly have been
convicted of either of these latter offences as “other offences” the commission
of which was included in the offence “as charged in the count,” if, in the
opinion of the jury, “the whole offence charged was not proved.” If R. v.
Shea[6],
implies the contrary, that decision cannot be supported. In a case such as that
at bar, that the jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count
no. 1 nor the whole offence charged in count no. 2 had been proved, is an
intendment which we must make in support of the verdict. Moreover, had the
accused been tried on an indictment framed as above indicated though charging
manslaughter only, and been acquitted, and had he been sub-

[Page 48]

sequently charged upon the same facts with
either of the offences set forth in the second and third counts, he could
successfully have pleaded autrefois acquit (s. 907 (2), Cr. C.). No harm
can result from the indictment expressly charging the two lesser offences set
forth in the second and third counts respectively, of either of which the jury
might have convicted the accused upon an indictment charging manslaughter only,
but so describing that offence as to include such lesser offences. Moreover,
any objection to the indictment on the ground of the unlawful inclusion in it
of counts nos. 2 and 3, if tenable, should have been the subject of a demurrer
or motion to quash the indictment under s. 898 of the Code.

Whatever may be the powers of the provincial
appellate courts in that regard, it is not open to this court to consider the
evidence for the purpose of determining whether upon it the jury, as reasonable
men, could have negatived the existence of any element necessary to constitute
the offence of manslaughter, or the offence charged in the second count,
consistently with their finding of guilty on the third count. It is clearly
impossible to say as a matter of law that in no case where manslaughter is
charged can a jury convict of some lesser offence included in that charge as
laid, or that an indictment may not contain counts charging such lesser
offences as well as the offence of manslaughter, which the evidence may not
prove. It was within the province of the jury to find that the offence charged
in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but that, for reasons which we
can only surmise and as to the validity or the adequacy of which we are not at
liberty to inquire, some essential element of each of the offences charged in
the first and second counts respectively was, in their view, not established
beyond reasonable doubt.

SMITH J. (dissenting).—With great respect I
differ from the view expressed by the Chief Justice in this case. I am in accord
with the view taken in the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Forseille[7], and by Mr. Justice Middleton in this
case. Where the death of a person is caused by the criminal negligence of
another, the crime is manslaughter. Sections

[Page 49]

284 and 285 have no application, in my opinion,
in such a case, as they are only applicable where the injuries have not caused
death. Where injuries are caused by the accused to a deceased person (as has
been found here), and these injuries have caused the death, as was
unquestionably the case here, I agree with the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan, and Mr. Justice Middleton, that counts under
sections 284  and 285  should not be allowed to go to the jury.

In such case an acquittal on the charge of
manslaughter is necessarily a finding that there was no criminal negligence,
which negligence is necessary to constitute a crime under sections 284  and
285 . It is, in my opinion, not proper in such a case to endeavour to entice a
jury to convict the accused by presenting to it an option to convict of a
lesser offence, not warranted by the facts, because it may be thought more easy
to get a conviction for such lesser offence. It is an invitation to the jury to
stultify themselves as the jury in this case has done, by first finding that
the accused was not guilty of criminal negligence, and then that he was so
guilty. It is said that the jury may have concluded that the injuries did not
cause the death. If they made such a finding, it was contrary to all the
evidence, and should be set aside.

The jury concluded that the accused was guilty
of criminal negligence, and, had it not been for the holding up to them of the
option of convicting either for the real crime or a lesser crime, they would in
all probability have convicted for the real crime. At all events the crime
committed by the accused, if any, was manslaughter and nothing else, and he was
entitled to a trial and a verdict on that charge, untrammelled by the
introduction of minor charges of which he could not, in my opinion, be properly
convicted on the facts.

In submitting a count for the lesser offence to
the jury in such a case, the prosecution is in effect saying to the jury, “The
accused is first charged with having, through criminal negligence, killed the
deceased, which is the very serious crime of manslaughter, of which you may not
be inclined to convict him. There is, however, a less serious offence charged,
which has nothing to do with the killing of the deceased. Under that count the
only question is, did the accused, by criminal negligence in driving his auto-

[Page 50]

mobile, inflict bodily harm on the deceased? If
you conclude that he did, you may disregard the killing altogether, and convict
him of the minor offence under this count.”

Where there is a real question as to whether or
not the injuries inflicted by the accused caused the death, the case is
entirely different, and the alternative counts are quite proper. In that case
it would be the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that if they found
criminal negligence, they must then find whether or not death resulted from the
injuries inflicted by the accused, and that if they should find that death did
result from these injuries, they must convict of manslaughter, but if they
should find that death did not result from this cause, they should convict of
an offence under s. 284  or s. 285 .

Appeal dismissed.

In re John Manuel

1928: December 4; 1928: December 21.

Present: Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith
JJ.

Criminal law—Conviction under Customs Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, s. 217—Harbouring goods unlawfully imported into
Canada—Summary jurisdiction under s. 217 (2)—Value of goods not shown to be
under $200.

Appellant was convicted before a stipendiary
magistrate (the conviction being affirmed, on appeal, by the County Court
Judge) for harbouring spirits unlawfully imported into Canada whereon the
duties had not been paid, contrary to s. 217  of the Customs Act , R.S.C.
1927, o. 42. The warrant of commitment did not show that the value of the goods
was under $200, and was, on that ground, attacked as bad on its face, as not
showing jurisdiction in the convicting court.

Held (Mignault
J. dubitante): In not
showing such value to be under $200 the warrant of commitment did not fail to
show jurisdiction.

Per Anglin C.J.C., Newcombe and Smith JJ.: Subs. 3 of said
s. 217 , introduced by amendment in 1925 (c. 39), does not impliedly limit the
summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than $200.
The special jurisdiction conferred by subs. 3 to proceed, alternatively, by
indictment, for a more rigorous penalty, where the value is $200 or over, does
not, so long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the
power exerciseable by magistrates under subs. 2, interpreted independently.

Per Rinfret J.:
The warrant recited a conviction of an offence described in terms strictly
following those of subs. 1 of s. 217 ; then subs. 2 enacts that “every such
person” guilty of the offence so described is “liable on summary conviction,”
etc. Therefore it could not be said that, on its face, the warrant did not show
jurisdiction. It may be that subs. 3 makes the offence indictable when the
goods are of the value of $200 or over; but there was nothing in the
proceedings before the court or on the face of the commitment to show they had
that value; moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly
asserted.

MOTION by way of appeal from the judgment of
Lamont J., dismissing an application by the present appellant for a writ of habeas
corpus.

The appellant was convicted before a
stipendiary magistrate “for that he * * * did, in the city of Halifax, on * * *
unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum
unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not
been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217 ” of the Customs Act , c.
42, R.S.C. 1927. The conviction
was affirmed, on appeal, by the County Court Judge.

The warrant of commitment, which recited the
conviction in the above terms, was attacked on the ground that

[Page 110]

it did not show that the value of the goods
alleged to have been harboured was under $200, and, therefore, that it was bad
on its face, as not showing jurisdiction in the convicting court. It was
contended, on appellant’s behalf, that the effect of the enactment, in 1925 (c.
39), of what is now subs. 3 of s. 217 , was to make the offence an indictable
one where the goods are of the value of $200 or over, and impliedly to limit
the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less than
$200. Rex v. Thompson[1] was
cited in support of the motion.

Duncan MacTavish for the motion.

John F. MacNeill for the Attorney-General of Canada,

The judgment of Anglin C.J.C. Newcombe and Smith JJ., was delivered by

Newcombe J.—This motion comes by way of appeal from the judgment of my
brother, Lamont, of 23rd November, 1928, dismissing an application by the
prisoner for a writ of habeas corpus. The papers shew that the prisoner was
convicted before Mr. Cluney, Stipendiary Magistrate of the city of Halifax, on
4th July, 1928, for the offence which will be literally described; and that the
conviction was, on 14th November, affirmed on appeal by the County Court Judge
for the district. A verified copy of the warrant of commitment dated 27th
November, 1928, is produced, and, in it, the conviction is recited as follows:—

Whereas John Manuel, late of Halifax, in
the county of Halifax, was on this day convicted before the undersigned, Judge
of the County Court for District No. 1 (acting on appeal by the said John
Manuel from a conviction made on the 4th day of July, 1928, before A. Cluney,
Stipendiary Magistrate in and for the city of Halifax), for that he, the said
John Manuel did, in the city of Halifax, on the 24th day of April, A.D. 1928,
unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour a quantity of spirits, to wit, rum
unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties lawfully payable have not
been paid, contrary to the provisions of Section 217  of the Customs Act ,
chapter 42, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and it was thereby adjudged that
the said John Manuel for his said offence should forfeit and pay the sum of one
hundred and fifty dollars, to be paid and applied according to law, and should
pay to the prosecutor the sum of five dollars and fifty cents for his costs in
that behalf;

[Page 111]

and it was thereby further adjudged that if
the said several sums were not paid forthwith the said John Manuel should be
imprisoned in the city prison of the said city of Halifax in the said city of
Halifax, for the term of three months, unless the said several sums and the
costs and charges of the commitment and of the conveying of the said John
Manuel to the said city prison were sooner paid.

The ground of the application is that the
commitment is bad upon its face, because it does’ not shew “that the value of
the said goods alleged to have been harboured is under $200.”

The most recent revision of the Public Statutes
of Canada came into force on 1st February, 1928, although declared by the proclamation
to operate by the designation of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. Section
217  of the Customs Act , c. 42, as contained in that revision, is
immediately derived from c. 39, s. 2, of 1925, and c. 50. ss.
25 and 26, of 1927.

The question arises under subs. 2 of the Act as
it appears in the revision designated 1927. That subsection originally formed
part of s. 197  of the Customs Act , as enacted by c. 14, s. 38, of 1888,
and it was re-enacted in a subsection, as it now stands, by the Revised Statutes
of 1906, c. 48, s. 219 . In 1925, s. 219  was repealed and at the same time
re-enacted with some amendments, including the addition of subs. 3; but there
was nothing in any of the earlier Acts corresponding in anywise with subs. 3.
Subsection 1  of section 219 , as enacted in 1925, in conformity with the
repealed section, had made it an offence, knowingly to harbour or conceal goods
unlawfully imported into Canada, and had provided that, if such goods were
found, they should be seized and forfeited; and that, if not found, the person
offending should forfeit the value thereof; and by subss. 2 and 3 it was enacted that

(2) Every such person shall, in addition to
any other penalty, forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be
recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and shall further be liable,
on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not
exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or
to both fine and imprisonment.

(3) Where the goods so harboured, kept,
concealed, purchased, sold or exchanged are of the value of two hundred
dollars, or over, such person shall be guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years and not less than
one year for a first offence, and to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten
years and not less than three years for a second and each subsequent offence.

[Page 112]

These two subsections were
not in themselves altered by the amendments of 1927, and are introduced into
the revision, in the terms in which they were enacted, by c. 39 of 1925.
Subsection 2 has in effect thus been in force for forty years, and, as a
separate subsection, since 1906. The amendments by c. 50 of 1927 are immaterial
to the question now at issue. It is the interpretation of subsections 2 and 3
of c. 39 of 1925 which is really involved, and the question is, whether the
commitment is bad because it is not stated therein that the value of the rum
unlawfully imported and harboured by the prisoner was less than $200.

It will be perceived that, by subsection 2, the
person harbouring the goods is liable, in addition to the penalties previously
provided, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding $200, and not less
than $50, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and not less
than one month, or to both fine and imprisonment. There is, in this subsection
itself, no limitation of the magistrates’ jurisdiction to proceed summarily,
depending upon the value of the goods. It is, however, provided by the
following subsection that, where the value of the goods is $200 or over, the
offender shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and liable to the
imprisonment therein prescribed; and it is argued that that provision impliedly
limits the summary jurisdiction to cases where the value of the goods is less
than $200.

I would reject that contention. It is not
uncommon practice, in Dominion legislation, to provide that a statutory offence
may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment; s. 499  of the Criminal
Code  is an example; and ss. 127 
and 128  of the Excise Act  are other examples; there is no inherent
objection to such alternative methods of procedure, and another specimen is
introduced by the enactments now in question. Subsection 2, in express terms,
applies to “every such person”; that is, to any person who, without lawful
excuse, harbours any goods unlawfully imported into Canada, whereon the duties
lawfully payable have not been paid. He is to forfeit a sum equal to the value
of the goods, recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction, and is
further liable, on summary conviction, to the additional penalties prescribed.
I

[Page 113]

think the intention of Parliament is
sufficiently obvious; and that the special jurisdiction conferred by subsection
3 to proceed, alternatively, by indictment, for more rigorous penalties, where
the value of the goods is $200 or over, or, in such a case, for first, second or
subsequent offences, at the option of the prosecuting authority, does not, so
long as the procedure by indictment is not invoked, detract from the power
exerciseable by the magistrates under subsection 2, interpreted independently.

It is not said, and cannot, I think, be said
with any justification, that subsection 3 affects the liability of an offender
under subsection 2 to forfeit a sum equal to the value of the goods, if that
value be $200 or more; and, if not, why should it affect the offender’s liability
to the penalties enforceable by summary proceedings, also imposed by subsection
2? The two subsections appear to be independent and self-contained, and
subsection 3 does not, in my opinion, imply or suggest any intention to abridge
or affect the operation of subsection 2 as it theretofore existed, and
continues to exist. I cannot help thinking that, when, in 1925, Parliament
amended the original section, if it were the intention to reduce the well
established jurisdiction of the magistrates, apt words would have been used,
and that it was not meant to change the law in such an important particular by
a far-fetched inference.

I am fortified in my conclusion by the judgment
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, pronounced in the case of Rex
v. Boutillier[2].

The appeal should, in my opinion, be dismissed.

Mignault J.—I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother
Newcombe dismissing the appeal of the prisoner Manuel from the refusal by my
brother Lament of a writ of habeas corpus to enquire into the cause of
his commitment, which commitment purports to have been made under section 217 
(formerly 219) of the Customs Act , chapter 42, R.S.C., 1927.

I understand that a majority of my learned
colleagues concur with my brother Newcombe in rejecting the appeal. I have not
been able, however, to free myself from

[Page 114]

considerable doubt as to the correctness of his
decision. Subsection 2 of section 217  (formerly 219), as originally drafted,
undoubtedly conferred upon two justices of the peace jurisdiction to try the
offence created by subsection 1, without regard to the value of the goods.
When, however, Parliament repealed the whole section in 1925 and re-enacted it,
a very important provision was inserted in the new section as subsection 3, declaring
that when the goods so harboured, etc., are of the value of $200 or over, such
person (the person harbouring the goods) shall be guilty of an indictable
offence and subject to a term of imprisonment not exceeding seven years, and
not less than one year, for a first offence.

It seems clear that in proceedings by
indictment, it would be essential to the validity of the indictment that it
should set out that the goods are of the value of $200 or over. When this value
exists, the statute creates an offence which, as it appears to me, is triable
only by indictment. The words “where the goods so harboured * * * are of the
value of two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an
indictable offence,” seem to me to exclude any proceedings other than by
indictment. I cannot, therefore, in a case coming within the condition of
subsection 3, conceive that it should be tried under the summary conviction
provisions referred to by subsection 2.

I do not think that there is any parity between
this case and the case contemplated by section 499  of the Criminal Code . Parliament,
no doubt, by express enactment, can provide that an offence shall be punishable
either on conviction on an indictment, or on summary conviction. Under section
499 the offence and the punishment are the same, whether the one or the other
mode of trial is selected. Here, however, where the value of the goods is under
$200, the offence is not the same as that contemplated by subsection 3, nor is
the punishment the same.

I am not in favour of dissents in criminal cases
coming before this Court by way of appeal, so I merely give expression to the
doubt I feel with respect to the decision of the majority of my colleagues.

Rinfret J.—The ground of the application by John Manuel for a writ of habeas
corpus was: That the warrant

[Page 115]

of commitment is bad on its face because it does
not shew jurisdiction in the convicting court, inasmuch as the goods unlawfully
imported into Canada are not
therein alleged to have been valued under $200.

I think the application was rightly refused by
my brother Lamont and the appeal from his judgment ought to be dismissed.

The warrant of commitment recites that John
Manuel was convicted, first, before a stipendiary magistrate; and then, on
appeal, by a judge of the County Court, for that he did

unlawfully, without lawful excuse, harbour
a quantity of spirits, to wit: rum unlawfully imported into Canada whereon the duties lawfully payable
have not been paid, contrary to the provisions of section 217  of the Customs
Act .

Subsections 1  and 2  of section 217  of the Customs
Act  read in part:—

1. If any person * * * without lawful
excuse, * * * harbours * * * any goods unlawfully imported into Canada * * *
whereon the duties lawfully payable have not been paid * * *

2. Every such person shall * * * be liable,
on summary conviction before two justices of the peace, to a penalty not
exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and not less than one month, or
to both fine and imprisonment.

The warrant, therefore, recites that Manuel was
convicted of an offence which is described in terms strictly following those of
subs. 1 of s. 217 of the Act. Then subs. 2 enacts that “every such person” guilty
of the offence so described is “liable on summary conviction, before two
justices of the peace,” etc.

I fail to see how, under those circumstances, it
can be said that, on its face, the warrant of commitment does not show
jurisdiction in the stipendiary magistrate.

It may be that subs. 3 of s. 217  makes the
offence indictable when the goods so harboured “are of the value of two hundred
dollars or over,” but there is nothing in the proceedings before us or on the
face of the commitment to shew that the spirits harboured by Manuel had that
value. Moreover, the presumption is that the jurisdiction was rightly asserted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Death
from abortion—Evidence—Direction to jury—Production of articles found in home
of accused—Admissibility—Pertinency—Prejudice against accused—New trial.

Upon the appellant's trial on
an indictment for murder, in order to prove death from abortion, it was
essential for the Crown to establish that the uterus itself of the deceased was
packed with cotton batting (some of which was found in the home of the accused)
and that this was done by the accused; and it was also of vital importance
that, upon that point, the direction to the jury should be so clear and
unequivocal as to leave no room for misapprehension. It was also irregular to
permit the production before the jury of articles found in the home of the
accused by the police acting under a search warrant, when these articles had no
real pertinency to any issue between the Crown and the accused, and two of them
specially (medical text books) were by their nature calculated to create
prejudice against the accused in the eyes of the jury. A new trial was ordered.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Fisher J. with a jury
which convicted the accused (appellant) of manslaughter.

J. W. deB. Farris K.C. for
the appellant.

J. A. Russell K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the court was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—The appellant
was found guilty of manslaughter after trial at Vancouver on an indictment for
murder.

We agree with the Chief Justice
of British Columbia that in two respects there was a mistrial. As to the first,
it was not seriously disputed that it was essential for the Crown to establish
that the uterus itself of the deceased Helen McDowell was packed with cotton
batting and that this was done by the accused. It was, therefore, of vital
importance that, upon this point, the direction to the jury

[Page 458]

should be so clear and
unequivocal as to leave no room for misapprehension. We think, with great respect,
that the references to this issue by the learned trial judge, and the manner in
which he presented the evidence to them, was likely to mislead.

We agree, moreover, with the
learned Chief Justice that the production before the jury of the articles found
in the residence of the accused by the police acting under a search warrant
(with the exception of the ""knitting needle and the bicycle spoke"")
ought not to have been permitted. These articles had no real pertinency to any
issue between the Crown and the accused and two of them, the books, were by
their nature calculated to create prejudice against her in the eyes of the
jury.

On these grounds the appeal
should be allowed. The majority of the Court are of the opinion that there
should be a new trial and a new trial is accordingly ordered. The Chief Justice
and Mr. Justice Davis think the conviction should be quashed.

Appeal allowed, new
trial ordered.

ON PROPOSED APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Application for leave to appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1025 , Criminal Code —Whether Judgment sought to
be appealed from conflicted with judgment “of any other court of appeal” “in a
like case”.

On an application, pursuant to s. 1025 , Criminal Code ,
for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
[1944] O.R. 230, dismissing the applicant’s appeal from his conviction on a
charge of unlawfully obtaining a sum of money by false pretences and with
intent to defraud, contrary to s. 405 (1) , Criminal Code , the
applicant’s contention being that the court which tried him had no
jurisdiction:

Held (dismissing the application), that the judgment in
The King v. O’Gorman, 15 Can. Crim. Cas. 173, was not “in a like case”
within said s. 1025 ; also that said judgment in The King v. O’Gorman,
which was rendered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, as was also the judgment
now sought to be appealed from, was not a judgment “of any other court of
appeal” within said s. 1025 .

APPLICATION, pursuant to the provisions of s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code  (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36), for leave to appeal to this Court from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing the applicant’s appeal from his conviction before the Court of
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of Simcoe on a charge that he did,
on or about the 31st day of August, 1942, at the Township of Nottawasaga, in
the County of Simcoe, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, by false
pretences and with intent to defraud, unlawfully obtain the sum of $500 from
Thomas Jones, contrary to s. 405 (1)  of the Criminal Code . A contention
on behalf of the applicant, that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace for
the County of Simcoe had no jurisdiction to try him as the evidence established
that the offence of which he was convicted was committed in the County of York
and he was neither apprehended nor in custody in the County of Simcoe within
the meaning of s. 577  of the Criminal Code , was rejected by the Court of
Appeal. It was contended on behalf of the applicant in the present application
that the

[Page 265]

decision of the Court of Appeal conflicted with other
judgments, including the judgment in The King v. O’Gorman[2],
“in a like case” within said s. 1025 .

G.A. Martin for the application.

W.B. Common K.C. contra.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—The only judgment with which it could be
seriously said there might be a conflict with the judgment of the Court of
Appeal in the present case, is that of The King v. O’Gorman[3].
The other cases referred to obviously presented no conflict at all and that was
practically admitted during the argument by counsel for the appellant.

After having carefully considered the judgment in the O’Gorman
case3 and having given the fullest consideration to the very able
argument of Mr. Martin, I have come to the conclusion that the O’Gorman case3
was “not a like case”, within the meaning of section 1025  of the Criminal
Code . In the present case, the distinction is made in the reasons for
judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario and I fully agree that the two cases
are distinguishable and, therefore, there exists no basis for granting leave to
appeal in the present case.

There is, to my mind, a further reason why the application for
leave should not be entertained. Judgment in the case of The King v. O’Gorman3
was rendered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the judgment from which it
is intended to appeal to this Court was also rendered by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. In the circumstances, it seems to me that it cannot be said this
would meet the requirements of section 1025 : that leave may be granted “if the
judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of
appeal”. I do not think that the section applies.

The application should be dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE
COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Speedy trial before County
Court Judge—Criminal Code , Part XVIII—One trial on three charges set forth on
single charge sheet—Improper proceeding—New trial.

[Page 318]

Three separate informations were laid against
respondent. He was committed for trial on all three. A single charge sheet
setting forth three charges was prepared by the Crown Prosecutor, and on this
the respondent was arraigned and elected to be tried speedily under Part XVIII of
the Criminal Code . There was one trial on all three charges before the
County Court Judge and respondent was convicted on each charge.

Held (affirming
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1942] O.W.N. 503; [1942] 4 D.L.R. 511): The conviction should be
set aside and a new trial held; it was improper to try the three charges
together. Sec. 856  of the Criminal Code  (allowing joinder of counts
in the same indictment) cannot be read into Part XVIII.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for the
Province of Ontario, pursuant to s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  and by
leave granted by a Judge of this Court, from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1],
allowing the appeal of the present respondent from his conviction by His Honour
Judge Parker in the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court of the County of York,
exercising jurisdiction under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code , on each
of three charges as follows: (1) of receiving certain wrist-watches and
wrist-watch bands, theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been stolen;
(2) of retaining in his possession the aforesaid property, theretofore stolen,
knowing the same to have been stolen; and (3) of retaining in his possession a
certain other wrist-watch, theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been stolen.
All three charges were tried together. The Court of Appeal for Ontario quashed the conviction and ordered
a new trial.

W.B. Common K.C. for the appellant.

W.J.P. Jenner for the respondent.

(At the conclusion of the argument for the
appellant, counsel for the respondent was not called upon; judgment was
reserved, and was delivered later.)

THE COURT.—This is an appeal by the
Attorney-General from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario setting
aside a conviction of Balciunas and directing a new trial.

[Page 319]

The point involved is a short one and, at the
conclusion of a very complete argument by Mr. Common on behalf of the
Attorney-General, the Court intimated that it was unnecessary to hear counsel
for the accused.

Three separate informations were laid against
Balciunas. He was committed for trial on all three. A single charge sheet
setting forth the three charges was prepared by the Crown Prosecutor and on
this the accused was arraigned and elected to be tried speedily under Part
XVIII of the Criminal Code .

There was one trial on all three charges before
the County Court Judge and Balciunas was convicted on each charge.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal, this
conviction was set aside and a new trial directed on the ground that it was
improper to try the three separate charges together, the point being that,
although there was authority in the Criminal Code  to include in an
indictment a number of separate charges, this was not the case under the
provisions of Part XVIII.

Under section 856 of the Criminal Code :

Any number of counts for any offences
whatever may be joined in the same indictment, and shall be distinguished in
the manner shown in form 63, or to the like effect: Provided that to a count
charging murder no count charging any offence other than murder shall be
joined.

The trial judge has a discretion to direct a
trial upon any one or more of these counts separately.

There is no special provision in Part XVIII and
a careful reading of the provisions of this Part as they now stand does not, in
our opinion, justify the contention of the Crown that section 856 can be
read into it.

We think that the Court of Appeal was right and
that each charge should be tried separately. This may incur what may seem to be
unnecessary expense in many cases, but the only remedy, in our opinion, is by
way of amendment to the Criminal Code .

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Constitutional law—War Measures
Act, 1914—Foreign Exchange Control Board—Orders in Council establishing Board
with certain powers, prohibiting importation of property into Canada without
licence and providing for fine or imprisonment on summary conviction

[Page 340]

or indictment—Whether ultra vires or
inoperative—Status of complainant—Accused not entitled to exercise option as to
mode of trial—Conspiracy—Whether illegal importation an indictable offence
within s. 673 Cr. C.—War Measures Act, 1914, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, sections 2,
8 (1) (2) 4—Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 1.

The appellant was convicted of having
imported Dominion of Canada bonds from the United States
 of America into Canada without having obtained from the Foreign Exchange Control Board a
licence so to do and of having conspired with others so to import. The
conviction was affirmed by the appellate court, St. Germain J. dissenting.—The
Governor-in-Council, by ss. 1 of s. 3 of the War Measures Act, 1914, was
authorized to make orders and regulations for the security, etc., of Canada which were declared by ss. 2 to have
the force of law. By s. 4, the Governor-in-Council may prescribe penalties, in
case of violation of these orders and regulations, which may be imposed upon
summary conviction or upon indictment. In September, 1939, an Order in Council
(P.C. 2716) established the Foreign Exchange Control Board with certain powers.
Subs. 1 of par. 22 prohibited importation of goods, etc., into Canada except under a licence granted by
the Board and subs. 1 of par. 40 prescribed that any person guilty of an
offence under the order would be liable on summary conviction to fine or
imprisonment, or both. By an Order in Council (P.C. 3799) issued in November,
1939, the words ""or on indictment"" were added after the words
""summary conviction"".

Held that the
appeal should be dismissed and the conviction of the appellant affirmed.

The contention of the appellant, that the
whole of the Order in Council (P.C. 2716) was ultra vires because it
gave power to the Board to pass regulations that only the Governor-in-Council
was authorized to promulgate under the provisions of the War Measures Act, must
fail. The. Board had not passed any regulations affecting the appellant with
respect to the charges against him; what the appellant did was in contravention
of ss. 1 of par. 22 of the Order, which had the same force as if it had been
enacted by Parliament itself.

The provisions of the Orders in Council
permitting prosecutions to be either on summary conviction or on indictment are
not inoperative. Section 4 of the Act permits the Governor-in-Council to
prosecute by one or the other method of procedure: no objection was found with
paragraph 40 as it originally stood and nothing in the Act prohibits the
Governor-in-Council to act as he did by the amending order in council.

There is nothing in the order in council
requiring a prosecution to be commenced by any particular official or
individual, or that the latter required a special authorization from the Board.
In any event, evidence disclosed that the complainant in this case had
authority in fact. Moreover, the contention that an accused is the only one
entitled to exercise the option as to the mode of trial cannot prevail.

Section 573  of the Criminal Code  provides
that ""every one is guilty of an indictable offence * * * who * * *
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence."" The
contention of the appellant that, because par. 40 of the order states that
every person guilty of an offence shall be liable ""on summary conviction
or on indictment""

[Page 341]

the offence of importing is not an indictable
offence, is unsound. The words ""indictable offence"" in s. 573  Cr. C.
merely mean an offence, as to which conspiracy is charged, which may be
prosecuted by indictment. That requirement is met by the terms of par. 40, even
in cases where proceedings had been commenced under the summary conviction
provisions of the Code.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming (St. Germain J.
dissenting) the conviction of the appellant for having imported bonds into
Canada without having obtained from the Foreign Exchange Control Board a licence
so to do and for having conspired with others so to import in contravention of
section 573  of the Criminal Code .

The questions of law before this Court on
this appeal, upon which the dissent in the court below was based, are
sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment now reported.

The appeal to this Court was dismissed.

Henry Weinfield K.C., Lucien Gendron K.C.
and S. D. Rudenko for the appellant.

G. Fauteux K.C. for
the Attorney-General for Quebec.

R. Genest K.C. and
P. Brais K.C. for the Attorney-General
for Canada.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Kerwin J.—The appellant was convicted of having imported Dominion of Canada
bonds from the United States of America to Canada without having obtained from the Foreign Exchange Control Board a
licence so to do, and of having conspired with others so to import. An appeal
from that conviction was dismissed by the Court of King's Bench, province of Quebec,
appeal side, with Mr. Justice St. Germain dissenting. The appellant now appeals
on the questions of law upon which that dissent was based.

The first four grounds of appeal refer to the
charge of importing as to which the War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927,
chapter 206, and Order in Council P.C. 2716 as amended by Order in Council P.C.
3799 require consideration. By section 2 of the Act, the issue of a proclamation

[Page 342]

is to be conclusive evidence that a state of war
exists. Such a proclamation was issued and, therefore, by subsection 1 of
section 3, the Governor in Council might do and authorize such acts and things,
and make from time to time such orders and regulations as he might deem
necessary or advisable (inter alia) for the security, defence, peace,
order and welfare of Canada. By subsection 2 of section 3, all orders made
under the section are to have the force of law, and by section 4:—

4. The Governor in Council may prescribe
the penalties that may be imposed for violations of orders and regulations made
under this Act, and may also prescribe whether such penalties shall be imposed
upon summary conviction or upon indictment, but no such penalty shall exceed a
fine of five thousand dollars or imprisonment for any term not exceeding
five years, or both fine and imprisonment.

Order in Council P.C. 2716 was accordingly
issued on September 15th, 1939. Provision was made therein for the
establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Board, which was given certain
powers, and by subsection 1 of paragraph 22:—

22. (1) No person shall import any goods,
currency, securities or other property into Canada except under and in
accordance with the terms of a licence granted by the Board; provided that this
subsection shall not apply to any property which has been shipped to Canada
from the Country of export prior to the date on which this Order comes into
force.

By subsection 1 of paragraph 39, every person is
guilty of an offence who

(d) violates
or attempts to violate any other provision of this Order or any regulation of
the Board.

And by subsection 1 of paragraph 40:—

Every person guilty of an offence under
this Order shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding Two
Thousand Dollars or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or to both fine
and imprisonment.

By a subsequent Order in Council (P.C. 3799,
dated November 29th, 1939), this subsection was amended by adding after the
words ""summary conviction"" the words ""or on indictment"".

The first ground of appeal is thus stated in the
appellant's factum:—

The substantive offence of which appellant
has been convicted, was illegally created by an enactment of the
Governor-in-Council delegating without right to the Foreign Exchange Control
Board the power of con-

[Page 343]

trolling ""Foreign Exchange"",
which power was already delegated to the Governor-in-Council by an Act
of Parliament, namely: The War Measures Act, Chapter 206, Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927.

Under this heading, it was argued that the whole
of Order in Council F.C. 2716 was ultra vires because the Foreign
Exchange Control Board might, it was suggested, pass regulations that only the
Governor in Council was authorized to promulgate under the provisions of the
Act. That argument is founded upon the maxim delegata potestas non potest
delegari. However, it appears that the Board has not passed any regulations
affecting the appellant with respect to the charges against him. What he did
was in contravention of subsection 1 of paragraph 22 of the Order in Council.
It has already been pointed out that by subsection 2 of section 3 of the Act,
all orders made under that section have the force of law and, therefore, the
paragraphs of the Order in Council establishing the Board and requiring that a
licence to import be obtained from the Board have the same force as if they had
been enacted by Parliament itself. The power of Parliament, and hence of the
Governor in Council, to do this is beyond question. In that connection
reference need only be made to the decision of this Court in In re Gray[1], and to the decisions
of the Privy Council therein referred to in The Queen v. Burah[2], Hodge v. The
Queen[3],
and Power v. Appollo Candle Company[4].
The other paragraphs of the Order in Council need not be considered because,
even if any question could be raised as to them, they do not imperil the
validity of the Order in Council at large and do not affect the particular
offence charged and the particular proceedings taken in this case (Rex v.
Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[5]
and the maxim relied on can have no application.

The second ground of appeal is thus put by the
appellant:—

The said Order in Council, dated the 15th
September, 1939, as amended by that of the 29th November, 1939, seeing that it
did not prescribe in what manner and by what courts the penalty enacted for the
commission of the said substantive offence was to be imposed—that is to say,
whether these penalties were to be imposed after proceeding by way of summary
conviction or whether by way of indictment—is inoperative as regards the
prosecution for said offence.

[Page 344]

The argument is that the Governor in Council
must prescribe how alleged violators of the orders or regulations shall be
prosecuted. That is, he may state that such violators shall be prosecuted by
summary conviction or he may state that they shall be prosecuted upon
indictment, but he may not give to someone else an option which, by the Act,
was conferred only upon himself. No objection is found with paragraph 40 as it
originally stood and we fail to see anything in the Act to prohibit the
Governor in Council acting as he did, by the amending Order in Council. Section
4 of the Act permits the Governor in Council to prescribe one or more methods
of procedure. The decision in The King v. Singer[6] can have no
application. All that was there decided was that no penalty or other mode of
punishment being expressly provided for infraction of an Order in Council, that
particular Order in Council, on its construction, did not fall within the term
""Act of the Parliament of Canada"" as used in section 164  of the
Criminal Code .

The third ground of appeal is as follows:—

The complainant had no authority to make
the choice of procedure to be followed in connection with the complaint lodged
against appellant, and, moreover, could not optate to proceed by way of
indictment rather than by way of summary conviction.

It was suggested that the complainant, Constable
Desaulniers, required a special authorization from the Foreign Exchange Control
Board. There is nothing in the Orders in Council under review requiring a
prosecution to be commenced by any particular official or individual and in any
event evidence was adduced to indicate that the constable had authority in
fact.

However, the gist of this ground of appeal is
that the appellant is the only one entitled to exercise the option as to the
mode of trial. It would be strange if that were so as it would mean that a
person against whom it was decided to prefer charges would first have to be
found in order to ascertain his wishes in that regard; and we are clearly of
opinion that this contention cannot prevail.

[Page 345]

In view of the conclusions already reached, it
is necessary to deal only with the appellant's fifth ground of appeal which
relates to the conviction for conspiracy. That conviction is based upon section
573  of the Criminal Code :—

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not
hereinbefore provided for, conspires with any person to commit any indictable
offence.

It is said that the importation of the bonds
into Canada is not an
indictable offence within the meaning of this section because paragraph 40 of
P.C. 2716 as amended does not provide that every person guilty of an offence
under the order shall be liable on indictment to fine, etc. If paragraph 40 did
read in that way, there could be no complaint in view of the provisions of
section 28 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1927, chapter 1):—

28. Every Act shall be read and construed
as if any offence for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted
by indictment, howsoever such offence may be therein described or referred to,
were described or referred to as an indictable offence;

(b) punishable on summary
conviction, were described or referred to as an offence; and

all provisions of the Criminal Code 
relating to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply
to every such offence.

2. Every commission, proclamation, warrant
or other document relating to criminal procedure, in which offences which are
indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, are described or referred
to by any names whatsoever, shall be read and construed as if such offences
were therein described and referred to as indictable offences, or offences, as
the case may be.

It is contended that because paragraph 40 states
that every person guilty of an offence shall be liable ""on summary conviction
or on indictment"", the offence of importing is not an indictable offence.
In our view that contention is unsound since all that is meant by
""indictable offence"" in section 573  of the Criminal Code  is that the
offence as to which a conspiracy is charged may be prosecuted by indictment.
That requirement is met by the terms of paragraph 40 even in cases where
proceedings had been commenced under the summary conviction provisions of the
Code.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Charge of
conspiracy to steal—Option by accused for trial before a judge without a jury—Speedy
trial—Bill of indictment later signed by the Attorney-General for trial before
a jury—Whether this procedure was a sufficient compliance with section 825 (5)
Cr. C. Question of jurisdiction of trial court ought to have been raised as
special plea before arraignment.

The appellants, charged with
conspiracy to commit the crime of stealing, made the option to be tried by a judge,
without the intervention of a jury, under the provisions of section 827  of the
Criminal Code . But, as such offence was punishable with imprisonment for a
period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General could ""require""
that the charge be tried by a jury, under the provisions of subsection 5  of
section 825  of the Criminal Code . After the election made by the appellants for
a speedy trial, the Attorney-General preferred a bill of indictment over his
own signature for a trial before a jury. Such trial took place and the
appellants were found guilty. The ground of appeal was that, under section 825
(5)  Cr. C, there must be a definite statement in writing by the Attorney-General
that he "" required"" that the charge be tried by a jury and that the
mere signature of the Attorney-General on a bill of indictment did not
constitute sufficient compliance with that section.

Held that the preferment of a bill of indictment by the
Attorney-General over his own signature for a trial before a jury was a
sufficient compliance with section 825 (5)  of the Criminal Code . There are no form
or words specified to indicate that the Attorney-General ""requires""
the charge to be tried by a jury. In the present case, it must be assumed that
the Attorney-General had knowledge of

[Page 363]

the facts in respect to the
election made by the appellants, which were of public record, and that, when he
intervened by preferring an indictment over his own signature for trial before
a jury, he did so for the purpose of complying with section 825 (5)  Cr. C. and
of exercising the right conferred upon him by that section. Moreover, it is no
longer open to the appellants to question before this Court the jurisdiction of
the trial court; that was a matter for special plea before arraignment and before
pleading the general issue. The appellants, by not having raised then the
question of jurisdiction, have waived any right to put forward such a
contention, even if the preferment under the signature of the Attorney-General
had not been otherwise sufficient and effective under section 825 (5)  Cr. C.

Minguy v. The King (61 Can. S.C.R.
263); Collins v. The King (62 Can. S.C.R. 154), and Giroux v.
The King (56 Can. S.C.R. 63) discussed.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the conviction of the appellants on a
charge of conspiracy to steal, after trial by a jury.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the
judgment now reported.

R. A. Hughes for the
appellant.

W. L. Scott K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

RINFRET J.—In this case, the
appellants had made the option to be tried by a judge, without the intervention
of a jury (s. 827  Cr. C.). But, as the offence charged was punishable with
imprisonment for a period exceeding five years, the Attorney-General could
require that the charge be tried by a jury, notwithstanding the consent of the
appellants to be tried by a judge alone (s. 825 , ss. 5  Cr. C.):
""Thereupon,"" so it is enacted, "" the judge shall have no
jurisdiction to try or sentence the accused under this Part"" (i.e., under
Part XVIII, Speedy trial of indictable offences).

After the election made by the
appellants for a speedy trial, the Attorney-General preferred a bill of indictment
over his own signature for trial before a jury.

The question is whether this was
a sufficient compliance with s. 825 (5)  of the Criminal Code .

In the Court of Appeal, the Chief
Justice of British Columbia decided that it was sufficient, and McQuarrie 

[Page 364]

and McDonald JJ.AA. agreed with
him, thus forming the majority of the Court. Sloan and O'Halloran JJ.AA.
dissented.

It was argued before us that the
form in which the indictment was signed by the Attorney-General was nothing
more than the form adopted under the practice in British Columbia, where the
indictment is usually preferred by the Attorney-General; and it was said that
the appellants could not be deprived of the benefit of the election they had
made, except by a requirement couched by the Attorney-General in terms which
unmistakably implied action under subs. 5 of s. 825  Cr. C.

It so happens that this Court has
not so far given a final decision on the point so raised. In Minguy v.
The King[1],
the indictment had been signed by the Crown Prosecutors on behalf of the
Attorney-General, but in addition to this the indictment carried the following
endorsement:

Le présent acte d'accusation
(indictment) est porté devant le grand jury par ordre du soussigné procureur
général de la province de Québec.

(Signé) L. A. Taschereau,

Proc. Général de la prov. de Québec.

Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Duff
J., as he then was, held that the ""requirement"" signed by the
Attorney-General was in compliance with section 825  Cr. C. Of the other members
of the Court, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. did not find it necessary to
decide the point, because they were of opinion that the election for a speedy
trial made by the accused before a District Magistrate was not valid. Idington
J. dissented on the ground that the election made by the accused was valid and
""any irregularity could not affect the appellant's right."" There was,
therefore, no majority decision on the question whether the endorsement signed
by the Attorney-General of Quebec in the form above reproduced could be held to
comply with sec. 825 (5)  Cr. C., the appeal having been dismissed on a
different point in respect to which the majority of the Court was in agreement.

In Collins v. The King[2],
the accused was held not to have elected for a speedy trial. The indictment was
preferred before the Grand Jury by the Crown Attorneys, who had signed it in
the following way:

[Page 365]

L. A. Taschereau, by Aimé
Marchand, Lucien Cannon, duly authorized.

And the endorsement found upon it
was:

This indictment is preferred
by the undersigned, the Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec.

L. A. Taschereau, 

Attorney-General for the Province
 of Quebec

Duff J., as he then was, and
Brodeur J. held that the right of the appellant to elect to be tried summarily
had been taken away by the "" requirement"" made by the Attorney-General
for a jury trial, the preferment of the indictment by the Attorney-General
under s. 873 Cr. C. constituting such requirement within the meaning of sec.
825 (5)  Cr. C. But Idington J. was of the opinion that the accused, having
previously renounced any desire for a speedy trial and having later pleaded to
the indictment without raising any objection, had waived any right he had for a
speedy trial. Anglin and Mignault JJ. found that the application made on behalf
of the accused for a postponement of the trial to permit him to re-elect was
not an election for a speedy trial. In the result, the appeal was dismissed,
but as will be seen, again there was no majority decision on the point whether
the preferment of the indictment in the form above stated was a sufficient
compliance with sec. 825 (5)  Cr. C.

In the Collins case[3],
however, there are to be noted the following statements made by the respective
members of the Court:

By Idington J.:

The accused, having been
charged before the magistrate, expressly renounced any desire for speedy trial
without jury and later notwithstanding pleaded to the indictment without
raising any sort of objection thereto, in my opinion, had waived any legal
right he had up to that time to elect for a speedy trial.

He further referred to Giroux
v. The King[4],
another decision of this Court, where Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. observed (p.
67):

To sum up. Both courts had
jurisdiction to try the offence. Assuming that the prisoner had by his plea to
the indictment selected his forum and acquired the right to be tried by a jury,
it was open to him to waive that choice and he was free to forego the privilege
of a trial by a jury. Consent cannot confer jurisdiction, but a privilege defeating
jurisdiction may always be waived if the trial court has jurisdiction over the
subjectmatter.

[Page 366]

I venture to say that to set
aside the proceedings below would in the circumstances of this case amount to a
travesty of justice.

Reverting to the Collins
case[5],
the present Chief Justice of this Court said:

In Minguy v. The
King[6],
I concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice of this Court that where the Attorney-General
prefers a bill of indictment under sec. 873 or where the bill of indictment is,
by the special direction of the Attorney-General, so preferred, that, in
itself, constitutes a requirement that the case should be tried by a jury
within the meaning of section 825 , ss. 5 .

I am not at all impressed by
the argument that the power given by section 873 is a different power from that
given by ss. 5 of sec. 825 . They are not the same power, no doubt; but it does
not follow that each must be exercised by an independent proceeding. A
proceeding under sec. 873 may and prima facie does import a determination
that the accused shall be tried by jury, a determination negativing his right
to be tried without a jury and at all events, in the absence of some qualifying
declarations, it is an exercise of the authority given by sec. 825 , ss. 5 .

Brodeur J., in the same case,
said (p. 163):

II me semble que la
signature du procureur-général sur l'acte d'accusation constitue cette demande
dont parle l'article 825-5 du code criminel. Je serais enclin â croire d'un
autre côté également que du moment que le procureur-général, sous l'article
873, porte devant le grand jury une accusation, qu'il y ait eu enquéte
préliminaire ou non, dès ce moment lá la cour du Banc du Roi est dûment saisie
de la cause et qu'elle peut la juger et en disposer. Nous n'avons pas à examiner
ce qui s'est passé anterieurement; et si l'accusé, comme il l'a fait dans le
cas actuel, demande un procès expéditif, la cour a parfaitement le droit de lui
refuser ce privilège et de procéder à faire juger la cause par un jury.

Dans le cas actuel, je considère
que l'action du procureur-général en signant lui-même l'acte d'accusation
démontre d'une manière explicite qu'il requérait que la cause fût jugée par un
jury.

It is to be further noted that
Mr. Justice Brodeur was one of the judges who sat in the Minguy case[7],
and it follows that if he had found himself called upon to decide that case on
the question whether the requirement there signed by the Attorney-General was
in compliance with section 825, he would evidently have come to the same
conclusion as that reached by him in the Collins case[8],
which would have meant a majority decision on that point in the Minguy
case[9].

It will, therefore, appear from
the several pronouncements made in this Court on the matter under discussion
that, so far, three judges: Sir Louis Davies C.J., the present Chief Justice,
and Brodeur J., have expressed the opinion

[Page 367]

that the endorsement signed by
the Attorney-General in Minguy[10]
and in Collins[11]
was a sufficient requirement that the charge be tried by a jury; and no
contrary opinion has been, so far, expressed by any judge in this Court; in
each instance, the judges who took part in the decisions having proceeded upon
different grounds.

As stated by the Chief Justice of
British Columbia, no form or words are specified to indicate that the Attorney-General
requires the charge to be tried by a jury.

In the present case, it must be
assumed that the Attorney-General had knowledge of the facts in respect to the
election made by the appellants, which were of public record, and that, when he
intervened by preferring an indictment over his own signature for trial before
a jury, he did so for the purpose of complying with sec. 825 (5)  Cr. C. and of
exercising the right conferred upon him by that section.

We can see no distinction in the
pertinent sense between the endorsements signed by the Attorney-General in the
cases of Minguy[12]
and of Collins[13],
and the indictment preferred by the Attorney-General in the present case under
his own signature.

Moreover, it is not open to the appellants
now to question the jurisdiction of the trial court. That was a matter for
special plea before arraignment and before pleading the general issue (The
King v. Komiensky No. 1[14];
Rex v. County Judge's Criminal Court, Re Walsh[15]; Rex v. Selock[16],
in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta).

Here, the trial court had
jurisdiction over the subject-matter. The preferment of the indictment under
the signature of the Attorney-General was effective for the purpose of
requiring that the charge be tried by a jury; and it did, in fact, bring the
charge before the jury. At the opening of the trial at the Assize Court, the
accused, assisted by counsel, stood mute, pleaded upon the arraignment, went to
trial, examined and cross-examined witnesses, called their defence and
addressed the jury. They were content to raise no question of jurisdiction, but
rather permit the trial to take its course, in the hope that the

[Page 368]

jury might acquit them; but since
the jury did not do so, they now say that the Court had no jurisdiction, and
they ask to be sent to another court in order that they may have another
opportunity of being acquitted. We are of opinion that, by what they did, they
have waived any right to put forward such a contention, even if the preferment
under the signature of the Attorney-General had not been otherwise sufficient
and effective under sec. 825 Cr. C. This is not a case of a consent conferring
jurisdiction upon a court which otherwise has not jurisdiction. In the words of
Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. in the Giroux case (1): It is merely the
waiver of a privilege which might have defeated the jurisdiction of the trial
court which had jurisdiction over the subject-matter. As stated in the judgment
of the Privy Council in Nadan v. The King (2),

There can be here no
possible question of a disregard of the forms of legal process or the violation
of any principle of natural justice.

For these reasons, the appeals
are dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Accused
acquitted at trial—Appeal by the Crown under section 1013(4) Cr. C.—New trial
ordered—Non-direction by trial judge on grounds not raised at the trial—No
exception taken by the Crown to the trial judge’s charge—Whether section
1013(4) Cr. C. applicable.

The appellant was tried on a charge of having
murdered one Germaine Rochon in Montreal. The case presented by the Crown
against the accused at the trial was that he had intentionally shot the
deceased with the intention to kill her. The defence relied upon the testimony
given by the appellant himself, that the shooting was the result of an
accident. The trial judge instructed the jury, that if they believed the
account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted. Such instruction
was accepted as satisfactory by counsel for the Crown and for the accused and
that it correctly formulated the single issue of fact which both counsel put
before the jury as the sole issue upon which it was their duty to pass. The
jury rendered a verdict of not guilty. The Crown appealed to the appellate
court of Quebec, under the provisions of section 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code .
A new trial was directed by that court on the ground that the trial judge had
erred in his charge by omitting to instruct the jury, first, that from certain
facts disclosed by the testimony of the appellant, the jury might have
convicted the accused of murder under section 259  (c and d) Cr.
C., and second, that the accused having in his charge a loaded firearm and
being bound to take reasonable precautions to avoid danger to human life, the
jury might have convicted the accused of manslaughter under section 247  and 252
(2)  Cr. C. These grounds, raised by the Crown before the appellate court, were
not considered nor suggested at the trial. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held that the
appeal should be allowed, the order granting a new trial be set aside and the
verdict of the jury acquitting the appellant be restored.

Subsection 4  of section 1013 Cr. C. was not
intended to confer jurisdiction upon an appellate court to set aside a verdict
of acquittal on a trial for murder in such circumstances as those in this case
and so entitle the Crown to an order for a new trial in order to present an
entirely new case against the accused.

[Page 351]

APPEAL by the appellant from a judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, setting aside a
verdict of acquittal rendered by a jury in a trial for murder and ordering a
new trial.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgments now
reported.

Antoine Senécal K.C. and Alexandre
Chevalier for the appellant.

John E. Crankshaw K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis
J. was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—I have had the benefit of reading the judgment
of my brother Kerwin and with that judgment I agree. I desire particularly to
emphasize the course of the trial, and as I conceive it, its bearing upon the
application of section 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code .

The appellant was indicted of murder by the
killing of Germaine Rochon on the 29th of June, 1938. The appellant and the
deceased Germaine Rochon were alone together in his apartment in the house of
one Donato when she was killed by a bullet discharged from a pistol. To Donato
and his wife who entered almost immediately afterwards and found the woman dead
and the appellant shot through the chest, he said, in effect, “I shot her and
then shot myself but she made me do it.”

The appellant, after long treatment in the
hospital, recovered and gave evidence at the trial on his own behalf. He
testified that he was holding the pistol in his hand intending to shoot himself
when the woman, realizing his intention, seized the weapon and, in the
confusion which followed, it “went off,” the bullet entering her body and
killing her; and that he then turned the pistol upon himself.

The case presented by the Crown was that the
appellant had intentionally shot the deceased Germaine Rochon with the
intention of killing her. The defence relied upon the testimony given by the
appellant himself. It was agreed by both counsel for the Crown and for the
defence, and the learned trial judge so instructed the jury, that if

[Page 352]

they believed the account given by the accused
he was entitled to be acquitted. I quote the words of the learned judge in
which he summed up the whole matter at the request of counsel for the defence
after the jury had retired and had been recalled:

The Court: Gentlemen, I have been asked by
the defence attorneys, to give a further explanation on a certain point. I have
told you that, if you are satisfied with the explanation given by the accused,
that the shooting was an accident, that he was entitled to an acquittal, but I
must add—and I think I did—I must add, even on that evidence, he is entitled to
the benefit of the doubt; that is, if you are not reasonably sure that his
explanations are not true, that you must give him the benefit of the doubt and
acquit him.

That is, the accused is entitled to the
benefit of the doubt on the entire evidence. You must be reasonably sure that
he has committed the offence before finding him guilty.

We are left in no doubt that this instruction by
the learned trial judge was accepted as satisfactory by counsel both for the
Crown and for the accused and that it correctly formulated the single issue of
fact which both counsel put before the jury as the sole issue upon which it was
their duty to pass. Mr. Crankshaw, who appeared for the Crown, both at the
trial and in this court, with the candour and sense of duty we should expect
from him, stated that this was the only issue which counsel intended to put
before the jury and did in fact put before them.

To the conduct of the trial, as a trial of that
issue, no objection was or could be taken.

The principal grounds of appeal were: first,
that the testimony of the appellant is susceptible of the interpretation that
the accused intentionally discharged the weapon with the purpose of killing
himself; and that it was by accident that the deceased was killed by the bullet
intended by the accused for himself; and that, accordingly, the jury ought to
have been instructed that if they so found they might convict the accused of
murder in virtue of section 259  (c) of the Criminal Code ; and

Second, the jury ought to have been instructed
that the accused, having in his charge a loaded firearm that in the
circumstances was calculated to endanger human life, in the absence of
precaution or care, he was under a duty to take the necessary precautions to
avoid such danger, and that if they thought the death of the deceased was due
to his failure to perform such duty they might convict him of manslaughter.

[Page 353]

It was not suggested at the trial that the
evidence of the accused was susceptible of the interpretation which is the
basis of the first of these grounds. Such an interpretation of his evidence
occurred to nobody. Nor did it occur to the Crown to suggest that a verdict of
manslaughter might be rested upon the second ground.

The Crown asked the jury to reject the story
told by the accused as a fabricated story and to find that he intentionally
shot the deceased with the purpose of killing her. The Crown, by the appeal to
the Court of King’s Bench, in effect asked to have the verdict on this issue
set aside, and to be permitted to present to another jury a case based upon the
testimony of the accused and upon a construction of it which did not occur to
anybody until after the verdict had been pronounced. At the new trial, of
course, there would be nothing to prevent the Crown advancing the same case as
at the former trial and supporting it by fresh evidence.

I do not think subsection 4  of section 1013 was
intended to confer jurisdiction to set aside a verdict of acquittal on a trial
for murder in such circumstances. The point is not merely that the Crown did
not take exception to the learned judge’s charge. The conduct of the trial with
respect to the single issue of fact which was raised by the case put forward by
the Crown was admittedly unimpeachable. The jury were told by the Crown that
the determination of that issue in favour of the accused would entitle him to
an acquittal. To set aside a verdict of acquittal in such circumstances, merely
because the case for the Crown might, on a possible view of the evidence, have
been put upon another footing would, it appears to me, introduce a most
dangerous practice; a practice not, I think, sanctioned by the statute.

The judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.
was delivered by

Kerwin J.—On a charge of having murdered Germaine Rochon on June 29th,
1938, the appellant Wexler was tried and acquitted. On appeal by the Crown to
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, of the province of Quebec, a new trial
was directed on the ground that the trial judge had erred by omitting in his
charge any reference to paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 259 of
the

[Page 354]

Criminal Code , and also to section 247  and paragraph
2 of section 252 of the Code. Wexler now appeals to this Court.

It appears from the evidence that for some time
prior to June 29th, 1938, Wexler had been drinking heavily and had on several
occasions formed the intention of committing suicide but that at the last
moment he had, on each occasion, desisted. He was on intimate terms with
Germaine Rochon, who several times had stayed with him in a boarding-house in
two rooms consisting of a bedroom and sitting-room. He had been in possession
of a revolver for some months before June 29th, 1938, and on the 28th of that
month he purchased a box of cartridges. On the day in question the revolver was
loaded with five of these cartridges and it, together with the remainder of the
cartridges, were in his rooms. He stated that he had definitely made up his
mind on June 28th to shoot himself. The girl spent that night with Wexler and
all of the 29th down to the time of the shooting. The accused testified that he
desired to do away with himself when he was alone; that he asked the girl to
leave and that she went to the telephone and the bathroom and returned to the
bedroom. While the evidence is not quite clear, I adopt the trial judge’s
understanding of it,—that Wexler was in the sitting-room and that he brought
the loaded revolver with him from the sitting-room to the bedroom where the
girl was, with his finger on the trigger. Notwithstanding his desire to commit
suicide when he was alone, Wexler’s explanation of this last action of his is
that he wanted to say good-bye. His account of what happened subsequently is as
follows:—

Well, she seemed to see me playing with the
revolver and I had gone over to the counter to take a drink and I was afraid
that if I would wait I would not be able to kill myself once more as I tried
before so I told her, I said “Good-bye.” I said “Good-luck” and I had the gun
and she came over and said something—I cannot remember exactly what—but she
grabbed hold of the gun and started to pull it and I fell with her on the bed.
I do not remember exactly but the gun went off. Whether it went off while we
were on the bed or before I cannot say for sure and after that she just got up
like with a queer sort of a shock and walked towards the other door. I followed
her so as to help her. I knew she was shot and she lay down and I could not
pick her up. When I saw that I said “There is no use to wait any more” and I
took the gun and pulled it and I do not remember much after that.

[Page 355]

The case made by the Crown against the accused
at the trial was that he intended to, and did kill the girl. The defence was
that so far as the girl was concerned the affair was an accident. At no stage
of the trial was the claim put forth that Wexler, while in the act of
discharging the revolver at himself with intent to commit suicide, shot the
girl. As appears from the evidence at the trial and from the charge of the
learned trial judge, and as admitted by counsel for the Crown, no such claim
was ever considered. Thus we find that after referring to the fact that Crown
counsel had defined “murder,” the judge stated in his charge:—

I think it is better for me to repeat it.
You know what murder is. It is the killing of a human being, with malicious
intent, with malice aforethought: Article 259  says that “Homicide may be
culpable and non-culpable, will be murder, in the following cases,”

and he then proceeded to read paragraphs (a)
and (b) of section 259  of the Criminal Code . He continued:—

I need not say that in this case, if the
accused, when he shot the girl, intended to kill her, it is murder; if you come
to that conclusion, because it is the first paragraph, if the offender means to
cause the death of the person killed—when he used the revolver and intended to
kill—and as a matter of fact, did kill her, it is murder.

There are two other paragraphs in Article
259 , but we are not interested in them; it is usually applied to other cases.

Counsel for the Crown, at the conclusion of the
charge, stated that he had no objection to it.

However, before the Court of King’s Bench and
before this Court, it was urged that if Wexler, while discharging the revolver
at himself, shot the girl, it would be murder, and that the trial judge should
have so instructed the jury. Reliance was placed in the Court below and in
argument before us on the charge to the jury in the case of Edward Hopwood[1]. From the report of the case, it appears:—

The defence put forward by the appellant,
who refused to be represented by counsel at the trial, was that he was shooting
at himself, that the deceased tried to stop him, and that there was a struggle,
in the course of which she was accidentally shot. The judge directed the jury
that even if they accepted this defence it would constitute murder if the shot
which killed her was intentionally fired for the purpose of killing himself,
but the jury found the appellant guilty of shooting the woman intentionally.

It is not necessary that we should pass upon the
correctness of the statement that “it would constitute murder

[Page 356]

if the shot which killed her was intentionally
fired for the purpose of killing himself,” but, in any event, each word of it
is significant and its real meaning may easily be overlooked. That meaning
becomes clearer upon a perusal of a report of the proceedings on the last day
of the trial on page 3 of the Times newspaper of December 12th, 1913,
where it is stated:—

Mr. Justice Avory, in summing up, explained
the law applicable to the case and said that the questions for the jury were:
(1) Did the prisoner intentionally discharge a loaded firearm at the deceased
woman with intent to kill her or to do her grievous bodily harm? or (2) did he
intentionally discharge it at himself with intent to kill himself and did the
shot intended for himself kill the deceased? If either of these was the true
view of these facts then the prisoner was guilty of murder. The third question
for the jury was, Is it possible to accept the theory that the pistol went off
by accident during a struggle to prevent him discharging it at himself, and was
the death of the woman caused by his unlawful attempt to commit suicide? If so,
they might find him guilty of manslaughter. If the death was not caused either
of those ways then they might find the prisoner not guilty.

In that case, as explained in the report[2], the jury found the prisoner guilty of
murder under the first heading referred to by Mr. Justice Avory. We do not know
the exact particulars in Hopwood and in any event, circumstances vary to such a
degree that except for any principle that may be involved, it is impossible to
determine one case by a reference to the evidence in another.

It may be a difficult question to decide in any
particular case whether there is any evidence that an accused has proceeded
beyond a mere intention to an actual attempt to commit suicide. In this appeal
we are not concerned with that problem nor with the one whether the Crown is
bound by the failure of Crown counsel to point out to the trial judge an
alleged omission in his charge on a question of law. The real point for determination
is whether, after an accused person has been tried on a charge of murder and
acquitted, the Crown is entitled to an order for a new trial in order to
present an entirely new case against him.

An appeal is given the Crown by the 1930
amendment to section 1013 of the Code “on any ground of appeal which involves a
question of law alone.” Assuming, without deciding, that the pertinent question
here is one of law, the Crown’s contention is not entitled to prevail.

[Page 357]

While Wexler had on June 28th formed the
intention of committing suicide on June 29th, it was never suggested during the
whole course of the trial, by cross-examination or otherwise, that the shot
that killed Germaine Rochon had been intentionally discharged by the accused at
himself with intent to kill himself, or that the death of the girl was caused
by an attempt on Wexler’s part to commit suicide. Similarly, the possession by
Wexler of the revolver was not relied upon to raise a duty on his part to avoid
danger to human life, under section 247; nor was the issue presented as to
whether he would, in that event, fall under the terms of subsection 2 of
section 252.

The appeal should be allowed and the order
granting a new trial set aside.

Crocket J.—I agree that in the circumstances disclosed by the trial record
in this case, where the only issue raised by the Crown was as to whether the
fatal shot was fired at the deceased intentionally, as claimed by the Crown, or
whether the revolver went off accidentally, as claimed by the accused, and that
issue was placed squarely before the jury in terms of which the Crown counsel
expressly approved, section 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code  cannot properly be
relied upon to enable the Attorney-General to avail himself of grounds in the
Appeal Court, which were never mooted upon the trial, for the purpose of
sending the accused back to a new trial on a murder indictment. So far as the
offence of murder was concerned, I think the learned trial judge’s direction,
having regard to the course of the trial, was unexceptionable, viz., that if
the jury believed the accused’s explanation of the shooting to be true, he was
entitled to be acquitted of the charge of murder. There can be no doubt that
the jury believed the accused’s explanation and acquitted him for that reason.
To subject him now, after he had been put in jeopardy, taken the stand in his
own behalf and been acquitted on that indictment, to a new trial thereon on the
ground that he might have been convicted of manslaughter if the Crown counsel
had not failed to put this feature of the case forward on the trial would, it
seems to me with all respect, be such a manifest injustice as

[Page 358]

Parliament could not well be deemed to have
intended when it enacted this drastic amendment to the Criminal Code .

For these reasons I have concluded that the
appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Conviction at trial for murder—Verdict
resting solely on circumstantial evidence—The facts not inconsistent with
rational finding of accused’s innocence—Common law rule—On appeal, conviction
quashed and acquittal ordered.

By the long settled rule of the common law—a rule by which
courts in Canada are governed and which they are bound to apply—where a jury’s
verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence, the jury, before
finding an accused guilty, must be satisfied not only that the circumstances
are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was committed by the
accused, but also that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the accused is the guilty person.

Held, in the present case (where the jury found accused
guilty upon an indictment for murder), that the facts adduced had not the
degree of probative force that is required to satisfy the test formulated by
said rule; and the trial Judge, on the application made by accused’s counsel,
should have told the jury that in view of the dubious nature of the evidence it
would be unsafe to find the accused guilty, and have directed them to return a
verdict of acquittal.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1938] O.R. 200,
quashing conviction and ordering accused’s acquittal, affirmed.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Ontario from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which
(Latchford C.J.A. dissenting), on appeal by the accused from his conviction at
trial before Chevrier J. and a jury on a charge of murder, quashed the
conviction and ordered the accused’s acquittal.

By the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was
dismissed.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

[Page 397]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—This is an appeal by the Crown against a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] by
which that court quashed a conviction of the respondent,
John A. Comba, after a verdict of guilty upon an indictment for
murder, Latchford C.J.A. dissenting.

It was stated before us by counsel for the Crown that the
Attorney-General, after reviewing the proceedings at the trial, had, because of
certain rulings of the trial judge, decided that the verdict of the jury could
not be allowed to stand and that a new trial would be necessary. The difference
of opinion between the majority of the court and Latchford C.J.A. concerned
solely the question whether there should be a further trial or, as the four
judges who constituted the majority of the court unanimously held, the
conviction should be quashed and the prisoner discharged on the ground that the
proof adduced did not establish a case sufficiently free from doubt to justify
a finding that the crime charged was committed by him.

Having examined the evidence minutely and weighed with care the
argument addressed to us on behalf of the Crown, we think our judgment should
be pronounced without further delay.

It is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict
rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the
long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the
jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied
not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the
criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as
to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is
the guilty person.

We have no doubt that the facts adduced have not the degree of
probative force that is required in order to satisfy the test formulated by
this rule; which is one that courts of justice in Canada are governed by and
are bound to apply.

We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal, whose reasons
for their judgment we find convincing and conclusive, that the learned trial
judge ought, on the application made by counsel for the prisoner at the close
of

[Page 398]

the evidence for the Crown, to have told the jury that, in view
of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner
guilty, and to have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal accordingly.
It is not, and could not, with any plausibility, be suggested that the case for
the Crown was in any way strengthened or improved by the evidence put before
the jury on behalf of the defence.

The appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

Criminal law—Carnal knowledge of girl under
age of 14 years (s. 301 (1), Cr. Code)—Corroboration.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1]
affirming (Robson J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant for the
offence under s. 301 (1)  of the Criminal Code , of carnal knowledge of a
girl under the age of 14 years.

On the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,
after hearing the argument of counsel for the appellant, and without calling on
counsel for the respondent, the Court delivered judgment orally, dismissing the
appeal. The Chief Justice stated that the only point open, on a fair
construction of the judgment of the dissenting judge, Mr. Justice Robson, was
the question whether or not there was corroboration in point of law; and stated
that, with the greatest respect for Mr. Justice Robson, this Court had come to
the conclusion that his view as to that could not be sustained.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
 ALBERTA

Seduction—Action by the woman alleged to have been

action—Nature of damage—Basis of damages—Sufficiency of evidence of damage to
support action—Verdict of jury.

[Page 318]

Sec, 5 of The Seduction Act, R.S.A., 1922, c. 102,
enacts that ""notwithstanding anything in this Act an action for seduction
may be maintained by any unmarried female who has been seduced, in her own
name, in the same manner as an action for any other tort and in any such action
she shall be entitled to such damages as may be awarded.""

[Page 319]

At the trial the jury found that the present appellant, an
unmarried female, and a plaintiff in the action, was seduced by defendant, and
that she suffered damage in an amount of $10,000. The trial judge (Ives J.)
dismissed her action, on the ground that damage is the gist of the action, that
the damage necessary to found a right of action in the woman must be of the
same character as gave the master his right of action, i.e., loss of service,
or at least an interference with the woman's ability to serve, and that there
was no evidence of such damage ([1934] 2 W.W.R. 511). The dismissal of the
action was (by a majority) affirmed by the Appellate Division, Alta. ([1935] 1
W.W.R. 199). On appeal to this Court:

Held (Davis J. dissenting), that the appeal be allowed,
and appellant have judgment for the amount of the jury's verdict.

Per Duff C.J., Rinfret and Kerwin JJ.: In view of the
decisions of the Appellate Division, Alta., in Gibson v. Rabey, (1916)
9 Alta. L.R. 409, and Tetz v. Tetz, (1922) 18 Alta. L.R. 364,
concerning the construction of said s. 5 as it stood prior to its reproduction
without material alteration in R.S.A. 1922, c. 102, that reproduction must be
taken to have given legislative sanction to the construction put upon the
section by those decisions (Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling &
Fishing Co., [1933] A.C. 402), and, having regard to the effect of those
decisions (discussed), any construction is precluded by force of which the
determining factors in the trial of an action of seduction under s. 5 are to be
deemed essentially or substantially the same as those in the trial of an action
of seduction under the other (preceding) sections of the Act or at common law.
Starting from this point, it follows that s. 5 should be construed according to
the ordinary meaning of the words and that damage of the special character
which is the gist of the action under the other sections of the Act—damage
actually or presumptively entailing some loss of service or some disability for
service—is not of the gist of the action under s. 5. (Per Kerwin J.: A
consideration of the language of s. 5 leads to the same conclusion. The
language analyzed and discussed).

There was sufficient evidence of damage to support the action.
Further, the jury's verdict must stand unless, examining the evidence as a
whole, the Court was clearly of opinion that it was one which no jury, acting
judicially, could give; and this had not been established by argument. So also
as regards damages. It was for the jury to determine whether appellant's
evidence, or how much thereof, should be accepted as correct; and on her
evidence it could not be said that, if it was accepted, the sum awarded was
such as no tribunal of fact acting reasonably could have awarded.

Per Davis J. (dissenting): Even accepting the
appellant's story, she could not, on the facts of the case and upon the
broadest possible interpretation most favourable to her of s. 5, succeed unless
s. 5 be reduced to giving a cause of action for fornication per se. If
the cause of action in s. 5 (excluding necessarily the relation of master and
servant) is the same as in the other sections of the Act, the birth of a child
or pregnancy or at least some physical disability as a direct result of the
conduct complained of is an essential element of that cause of action, and the
illness that was proved in this case was too remote and insufficient to sustain
the action. If, on the other hand, the cause of action in s. 5 is to be
regarded as a new and independent tort, separate and distinct from the action
for seduction referred to in the other sections, then, whatever be the
essential elements of this new

[Page 320]

cause of action, there must be at least something in the
nature of negation of choice. Taking either interpretation of s. 5, the action
failed upon the evidence.

In interpreting s. 5, the statute should be read as a whole
and s. 5 interpreted, not as an isolated piece of legislation to be given a new
meaning and significance, but as part of an entire statute dealing with the
same subject-matter. The other (preceding) sections (discussed) necessarily
import as an essential ingredient of the cause of action an illegitimate child
born or conceived as a result of the relations complained of; and that has
always been the common understanding in Canada of the cause of action for
seduction. The language of s. 5 analyzed and discussed, and with reference to
the language in the other sections. Sec. 5 should not be interpreted so as to
import into the words used therein a different quality or meaning from that
which the same words have in the other sections. In the cause of action under
s. 5 there is necessarily excluded the relation of master and servant as an
essential, and with it the necessity for proof of loss of service; but the
substance of the cause of action, the birth of a child or at least the
condition of pregnancy, remains. The re-enactment of the statute in the
revision of 1922 does not touch the point as to the substance of the cause of
action, because the fact of birth of a child or pregnancy in the Alberta cases
prior to the revision was admitted or accepted by counsel and those cases did
not turn upon that question. The evidence in the present case disclosed no
cause of action.

APPEAL by the female plaintiff from the judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1]
dismissing her appeal from the judgment of Ives J.[2].

The action was brought by the present appellant and her father
for damages for alleged seduction of her by the defendant. At the trial before
Ives J. and a jury, the jury found that the defendant seduced the present
appellant and found damages for $10,000 in her favour and for $5,000 in favour
of the other plaintiff. Upon announcement of the verdict by the jury,
plaintiffs' counsel moved that judgment be entered in accordance therewith and
defendant's counsel moved for dismissal of the action, submitting that there
was no cause of action shewn. Ives J. reserved judgment and later delivered
judgment dismissing the action2. His grounds were stated as follows:

Upon the verdict being announced by the jury, counsel for the
defendant moved for dismissal of the action on the ground that there was no
evidence of any interference with the daughter's services to the parent to
which he was entitled and no evidence that the seduction in any way interfered
with the daughter's ability to serve.

It is quite clear that the daughter left her home in Edson
with the consent and approval of her parents and was accompanied to Edmonton by
her mother. It is equally undoubted that no illness resulted from the

[Page 321]

seduction and no evidence that the ability of the daughter to
render services was in any way interfered with.

In my opinion the law is well settled that damage is the gist
of the action and I am also of the opinion that the damage necessary to found a
right of action in the woman must be of the same character as gave the master
his right of action, that is, loss of service, or at least an interference with
the woman's ability to serve. I see nothing in our statute to convey a contrary
intendment of the Legislature.

In my view of the law the action must be dismissed with
costs, * * *

An appeal by the plaintiffs to the Appellate Division was
dismissed (Clarke and Lunney, J.J.A., dissenting as to the appeal of the
present appellant)[3]. The
present appellant then appealed to this Court.

The operative sections of The Seduction Act, R.S.A.
1922, c. 102, read as follows:

PERSONS ENTITLED TO
MAINTAIN ACTION

2. The father or, in case of his death, the mother (whether
she remains a widow or remarries) of any unmarried female who has been seduced
and for whose seduction the father or mother could maintain an action in case
such unmarried female was at the time dwelling under his or her protection may
maintain an action for the seduction, notwithstanding such unmarried female was
at the time of her seduction serving or residing with another person upon hire
or otherwise.

[1903(2), c. 8, s. 1.]

3. Upon the trial of an action for seduction brought by the
father or mother it shall not be necessary to prove any act of service
performed by the party seduced but the same shall in all cases be presumed and
no evidence shall be received to the contrary; but in case the father or mother
of the female seduced had before the seduction abandoned her and refused to
provide for and retain her as an inmate then any other person who might at common
law have maintained an action for the seduction may maintain such action.

[1903(2), c. 8, s. 2.]

4. Any person other than the father or mother who by reason of
the relation of master or otherwise would have been entitled at common law to
maintain an action for the seduction of an unmarried female may still maintain
such action if the father or mother is not resident in Alberta at the time of
the birth of the child which is born in consequence of the seduction or being
resident therein does not bring an action for the seduction within six months
from the birth of the child.

[1903(2), c. 8, s. 3.]

5. Notwithstanding anything in this Act an action for
seduction may be maintained by any unmarried female who has been seduced, in
her own name, in the same manner as an action for any other tort and in any
such action she shall be entitled to such damages as may be awarded.

[1903(2), c. 8, s. 4.]

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret J. was delivered by

DUFF C.J.—This appeal raises an important question as to
the construction of section 5 of The
Seduction Act of Alberta (Cap. 102, R.S.A.
1922) which was first enacted as Cap. 8 of the Ordinances of the North West Territories, 1903.

There is undeniably force in the argument that the ""action
for seduction,"" which an unmarried female is by that section given the
right to institute, rests ""in its essentials"" upon the same cause of
action as the ""action for seduction"" which the parents are entitled
to bring under sections 2 and 3 of the statute. This is the view
which prevailed with the majority of the Appellate Division and is supported by
the Chief Justice of Alberta in a powerful judgment.

Each part of the statute ought, it may fairly be argued, to.be
read with each of the other parts; and, reading sections 2 and 3
with section 5, and
section 5 with sections 2 and 3,
and construing each of these parts of the enactment by the light of the
other, and having regard to similarity of language in sections 2 and 5,
the contention is by no means without substance that, prima facie, section
5 presupposes a cause of action
capable of being asserted by the parents, if (at all events) living in Alberta,
and that, given such a cause of action vindicable by the parents, a cause' of
action having the same constitutive elements (the parental relations being, of
course, in this case irrelevant) is, by section 5, bestowed upon the seduced woman.

It follows from this, it is said, that damage of the kind which
is the gist of the action under sections 2
and 3 (disability for
service resulting from childbirth, pregnancy or physical illness directly due
to the sexual intercourse) is also of the essence of the cause of action under
section 5.

The other view of the section, which was, I think, in effect
accepted by Mr. Justice Clarke and Mr. Justice Lunney, may be summarily stated
thus:

Sections 2 and 3 are concerned exclusively with
conduct that constitutes a wrong to the parents, and, in point of

[Page 323]

law, the essence of this actionable wrong
consists in the fact that it results in some loss of the services of the
daughter, or illness entailing (presumptively or actually) some disability for
service; while section 5, on the contrary, is concerned exclusively with the
wrong which the law, by the parent enactment passed by the Legislature of the
North West Territories in 1903, first recognized as effecting a prejudice to
the interests of the seduced female herself, in respect of which she is
entitled to legal protection, and that the sole purpose of the enactment in
section 5 is to provide redress for this wrong.

Then, it is said, in construing the enactment in which this novel
rule and principle of liability are embodied, one would not appear to be
justified in imputing to the words employed by the Legislature for that purpose
alone, a rather artificial signification derived from the earlier sections
which, notwithstanding the similarity of language, do deal with a
subject-matter that is widely different; and, it is added, there is less
likelihood of frustrating the legislative intention if one gives effect to this
enactment according to the commonly understood meaning of the words, having
regard, of course, to its manifest purpose. The cause of action under section 5
arises, no doubt, out of an occurrence or occurrences which, assuming the
conditions to subsist as to resulting damage, might form the foundation of an
action by the parents of the woman. But the action under section 5 is bestowed
upon a person who, ex hypothesi, is a voluntary participant in the acts
which are the essential basis of her right to redress; and, in consequence, in
passing upon a claim for damages under section 5, the tribunal of fact is faced
with issues and with considerations of an order totally different in their
nature from anything that can arise in considering or adjudicating upon a claim
under sections 2 and 3. That circumstance alone, it is said, sharply
differentiates, in substance, the cause of action under the later section from
that under the earlier.

First of all, it is said that in an action under- sections 2 and
3, on the question whether or not the cause of action has been constituted (as
distinguished from the assessment of damage), the conduct of the seduced woman
is irrelevant; while leave and licence by the parents, which might be
established by proving consent either by words or con

[Page 324]

duct, would be an answer to the action.
In an action under section 5, on the other hand, the conduct of the woman as
well as her character both enter into the determination of the existence of the
cause of action. The relief given by section 5 presupposes, it is said, that
the woman seduced was, at the time she was corrupted by the defendant, a woman
of virtuous life and habits; and, moreover, that the words of the section, read
according to the meaning they bear in the common language of men, imply that
some enticement has been employed by the defendant, or some unfair advantage
taken, through which he has induced the woman to have intercourse with him. All
this, as has been said, would be irrelevant in an action under the earlier
sections, which would lie even in a case in which it appeared that the advances
of the woman seeking the gratification of her own desires were the
preponderating factor in bringing about the common act. Again, no consent, no
enticement or manoeuvring on the part of the parents could be relevant in
determining the existence of a cause of action under section 5.

In this view, since the action under section 5 has nothing to do
with the parental relation, nothing to do with the relation of master and
servant, nothing to do with loss of service or service, there is, it is
contended, no a priori probability that section 5 contemplates relief
conditioned upon the seduction being followed by childbirth or pregnancy or
illness directly traceable to physical act of copulation and giving rise to
some disability for service; and it is not susceptible of dispute that the
language of the section (assuming damages to be of the essence of the cause of
action) when read alone, and without colour derived from the preceding
sections, neither expresses nor implies such a condition.

In passing upon these rival views we are not without assistance
from judicial decisions. The ordinance of the North West Territories of 1903
was reproduced in its entirety (with the addition of the heading ""Persons
entitled to maintain action "") by Cap. 102 of the R.S.A. 1922, which came into force on the 19th January, 1923,
by virtue of a statute which was assented to on the 9th day of March, 1923.

Before that date, two decisions were pronounced by the full court
of Alberta, one in 1916 and one in 1922, both in

[Page 325]

the same sense. The decisions are
concerned with the construction of section 5 of the North West Territories
Ordinance; and, in so far as they involve a construction of that section, they
must, we think, be taken to have received legislative sanction when section 5
was reproduced without material alteration in R.S.A. which came into operation
in 1923. (Barras v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling & Fishing Co.)[4].

I turn now to the decisions. The first in Gibson v. Rabey[5].
Two judgments were delivered, one by Scott J., another by Beck J., in which
Stuart J. concurred. Scott J. proceeded upon the ground that seduction in
section 5 has its ordinary meaning and implies some enticement on the part of
the seducer by which a virtuous woman is induced to give herself to him. That
appears conclusively from the sentence:

In my view the evidence was sufficient to support the
conclusion the trial judge must have reached that she was enticed and persuaded
by

the defendant to commit the act. Beck J., in the course of his
judgment, observes at p. 414 that,

The section of the ordinance already quoted, though
awkwardly drafted, inasmuch as in giving the woman herself a right of action it
does away with the whole idea of service and loss to a master, by the clearest
necessary intendment constitutes the seduction, not mere seduction but seduction
followed by damages consequent upon the seduction, the cause of the action. For
I think that damage was the ""gist"" of the action in the case, and at
all events the ordinance itself, I think, makes it the gist of an action by the
woman seduced. It was contended that, in an action by a woman for her own
seduction, the word should be interpreted as it appears to be very generally by
the American authorities to involve an enticing by the defendant. The history
of the action shews that so long as the action was based on loss of service,
seduction was ultimately taken to mean no more than having carnal intercourse
with. The reason, however, was that damage by way of loss of service was the
gist of the action and consent by the servant was no answer to an action by the
master.

He proceeds, at p. 415:

Now that the woman herself is enabled to be the plaintiff, 1
think her action is subject to a like defence, that is, if she be the tempter
or even if she deliberately consents from lasciviousness or even from the strength
of mere natural passion, provided her consent has not been brought about by
enticement of the defendant, she cannot recover.

In this way, I come in effect to the same conclusion as my
brother Scott.

I think, however, that in the absence of evidence of loose
behaviour on the part of the woman, the presumption is that there was
enticement on the part of the defendant in cases of this sort and that the
burden

[Page 326]

of shewing that the plaintiff cannot
succeed on the ground that she was at least equally morally guilty is on the
defendant.

Although it does not appear from the report, it seems that in
this case pregnancy supervened, and, consequently, although it is stated by
Beck J. that damage is of the gist of the action, no question arose as to the
character of the damage necessary to sustain the action.

The second decision was pronounced in Tetz v. Tetz[6]
by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Scott C.J. Stuart,
Beck, Hyndman and Clarke JJA.) The judgment of the Court was delivered by Beck
J.A., and in the course of his judgment he summarizes the judgment of Stuart J.
and himself in Rabey's case[7] at pp.
365 and 366, thus:

In that case I said that, in my opinion, it would be a defence
to an action for seduction if it were shown,(1) that the woman was the
tempter, or(2) even if she deliberately consented from lasciviousness or
even from the strength of mere natural passion, provided her consent had
not been brought about by the enticement of the defendant. To this I added
that, in my opinion, in the absence of evidence of loose behaviour on the part
of the woman, the presumption is that there was enticement on the part of the
man and that the burden of showing that the plaintiff could not succeed on the
ground that she was at least equally morally guilty is on the defendant. Stuart
J. concurred with me and Scott C.J. (the Court being composed of three members)
was evidently of the same opinion.

Now, it is clear that some points were decided in these two cases
touching the construction and effect of section 5. In each it is declared that
the plaintiff's right to recover under that section is conditioned in certain
specified respects. When the facts are ascertained, it is held, the plaintiff
cannot succeed if certain propositions of fact are established concerning the
conduct of the plaintiff and defendant towards one another; and the
investigation, when the plaintiff's right to recover is disputed, will involve
the assignment to one or other of the parties the preponderating role in bringing
about the result, the investigation of the part played by the woman's natural
passion, and, it may be, the determination of the relative moral guilt of the
pair.

These decisions, in other words, recognize that, in examining a
disputed claim for relief under section 5, the court must deal with issues and
considerations which could not arise and would not be relevant in the trial of
an action under sections 2 and 3. It is of no importance that the

[Page 327]

matters mentioned in the judgment of Beck
J.A. are said to be matters of defence; the investigation of these matters
necessarily results, the judgments recognize, from the fact that the right to
relief under section 5 is given to the seduced woman herself.

Seduction, as Beck J.A. says, at common law and in the earlier
sections of the Act signifies nothing more than carnal intercourse. Enticement
on one side or the other, relative moral responsibility, and so on, are matters
which, as already observed, have no bearing upon the issue as to the existence
of the cause of action. Under section 5, according to the decisions, such
matters are the determining factors; and, in view of these decisions, since the
re-enactment of the statute in 1922, any construction is precluded by force of
which the determining factors in the trial of an action of seduction under
section 5 are to be deemed essentially or substantially the same as those in
the trial of an action of seduction under the earlier sections or at common
law.

These decisions have nothing to say as to the nature of the
damages which must be proved by the plaintiff under section 5, although in the
first of them it was definitely stated that under that section damage is the
gist of the action.

Starting from this point, it follows, we think, that section 5
should be construed according to the ordinary meaning of the words and that
damage of the special character mentioned—damage actually or presumptively
entailing some loss of service or some disability for service—is not of the
gist of the action under that section.

Neither have we any doubt that there was sufficient evidence of
damage to support the action.

There remains the question raised by the able argument of Mr.
Smith in support of his contention that the judgment of the Appellate Division
should not be disturbed on the ground that, on the evidence, the only
reasonably admissible finding would be one against the plaintiff, or, in the
alternative, that there should be a new trial on the ground that the verdict is
against the weight of the evidence and particularly that the damages awarded
are unreasonably excessive. This argument presents a question of a type with
which the courts are very familiar.

[Page 328]

It is no part of our duty to ask ourselves what verdict we should
find upon the evidence as presented to us in the record without the advantage
of hearing and seeing the witnesses. The settled rule is that the verdict of
the jury must stand unless, examining the evidence as a whole, the court is
clearly of opinion that it is one which no jury, acting judicially, could give.
This, in our opinion, has not been established by argument. So also as regards
damages. It was for the jury to determine whether the evidence, or how much of
the evidence, of the appellant should be accepted as correct; and we find ourselves
unable to say that if her evidence was accepted the sum awarded was such as no
tribunal of fact acting reasonably could have awarded.

The judgment of the Appellate Division should be vacated and in
lieu thereof it will be ordered that judgment be entered for the amount of the
verdict. The appellant will have her costs throughout.

KERWIN J.—I agree with the judgment proposed by my Lord
the Chief Justice and with the reasons therefor given by him, but I think I
should add that a consideration of the language of section 5 of the Act leads me to the same
conclusion.

The section does not provide that ""the"" action
of ""seduction"" may be maintained, but the expression used is
""an action for seduction."" In the old action of
seduction at common law, the master was required to prove an act of service. A
parent as master or mistress would not be able to prove that act where the
daughter was serving or residing with another person, and, it being deemed that
the parent should have a right of action under those circumstances, the first
change in the common law, made by statute, was to provide that the parent might
maintain an action for seduction notwithstanding the daughter was serving or
residing with another person, and it was also provided that the parent need not
prove any act of service performed by his daughter for the parent. Then in 1903 when the Ordinance was passed, the
intention was to give to the woman, by section 5, a right of action of some sort even though a parent could
by statute maintain the ordinary action for seduction notwithstanding the
absence of the daughter from home, etc. Hence the expression
""notwithstanding anything in this Act.""

[Page 329]

The decisions as to the effect of the first alteration by statute
in the common law are clear that, when the new right of action was given to the
parent, while the statute provided that evidence of service need not be given,
the Act did not dispense with the necessity of proving loss of service. There
is no provision in section 5 that in the action thereby given ""it shall
not be necessary to prove any act of service performed by the party
seduced."" If the contention that section 5 is speaking of the old form of
action be correct, there would appear to be as much reason for the plaintiff to
prove actual service (to someone) as the loss of that service.

The learned Chief Justice of Alberta was of opinion that the
words ""in the same manner as an action for any other tort"" dealt with
a mere matter of procedure, but, with respect, it seems to me rather that they
are part of the substantive provisions dealing with the right of action thereby
given and lend weight to the argument that the unmarried female may maintain a
new action and not the old action of seduction.

The section concludes that ""she shall be entitled to such
damages as may be awarded,"" It does not say that she is entitled to ""the""
damages, thus indicating that the damages in an action brought by her may
be on a different basis from the damages that could have been given in an
action by a parent.

HUDSON J. concurred in the result.

DAVIS J. (dissenting)—The appellant, an
unmarried female, brought an action for seduction in the Supreme Court of
Alberta against the respondent, a married man. The appellant's own story may be
shortly but I think fully stated. From October, 1930, until July, 1933, she
says she had frequent sexual intercourse with the respondent who she knew from
the beginning was a married man with a wife and family. When the relations
first commenced she was a girl of about 18 years and 4 months of age. During
the summer of 1932 she consulted a physician, as she had lost weight during the
two prior years. She says she had ""stomach trouble brought on by
nerves"" and she felt ""very tired all the time,"" and that the
pills she had been taking to avoid pregnancy had upset her. The physician,

[Page 330]

who was called by her counsel as a
witness at the trial, described her then condition as ""irritable
colon,"" an irregular function which ""might be produced by any
systemic condition which causes fatigue or running down of the patient by the
use of cathartics to correct constipation which had existed ""—and which
condition, he said, is frequently associated with a nervous condition. He said
that there was no doubt that she was suffering from constipation. At that time
she went home to the country to her parents for 5 or 6 weeks' rest. Upon her
return to Edmonton, she admits she continued her relations with the respondent.
In January, 1933, she says she told with a good deal of remorse a young man of
her own age who, she says, was proposing marriage to her, of her relations with
the respondent. But she admits she continued thereafter the same relations. In
May, 1933, she says that at the instance of the young man she consulted a
solicitor. Obviously this was with a view to taking some action against the
respondent. But she admits again that she continued thereafter the same
frequent relations with the respondent down to July 3rd, 1933. On the evening of July 5th, 1933, she says the young man and the solicitor pursued in a motor
car the car in which she and the respondent were driving about the city, and
that the respondent became aware that his car was being followed. The
respondent was a man prominent in the public life of the province and the
episode of that evening appears to have put an end to the relations between the
parties, if there ever were any such relations as the appellant describes.
Shortly thereafter the writ in this action was issued. It is admitted that
there was not a child, or even pregnancy, resulting from the alleged relations.
Nor is the action founded upon any misrepresentation, coercion or deceit. It is
a suit upon section 5 of the Alberta Seduction Act, being chap. 102 of
the Revised Statutes of 1922.

In my opinion, one has only to state the facts of this case to
see, and I say it with the greatest deference to those from whom I differ, that
the appellant cannot succeed upon the broadest possible interpretation, most
favourable to the appellant, that can be put upon section 5 unless it be
reduced to giving a cause of action for fornication per se.

[Page 331]

If the cause of action in section 5 (excluding necessarily the
relation of master and servant) is the same as in the other sections of the
statute, the birth of a child or pregnancy or at least some physical disability
as a direct result of the conduct complained of is an essential element of that
cause of action, and the illness that was proved in this case was too remote
and insufficient to sustain the action. If, on the other hand, the cause of
action in section 5 is to be regarded as a new and independent tort, separate
and distinct from the action for seduction referred to in the other sections of
the statute, then, whatever be the essential elements of this new cause of
action, there must be, it seems to me, at least something in the nature of
negation of choice. Taking either interpretation of section 5, the action, in
my opinion, fails upon the evidence.

The proper method of interpretation of section 5, in my view, is
to read the statute as a whole. Section 5 is part and parcel of the entire
statute. The statute is a very short one, there being only four operative
sections. It was enacted in its entirety as an ordinance of the North West Territories
in 1903 and became part of the statute law of the province of Alberta when that
province was formed out of a part of the Territories. The statute has remained
unchanged except that in the revision of 1922 a heading in large type
""Persons Entitled to Maintain Action"" was inserted at the commencement
of the operative provisions of the statute. Section 5 therefore ought to be
interpreted, not as an isolated piece of legislation to be given a new meaning
and significance, but as part of an entire statute dealing with the same
subject-matter.

In examining the statute, it is to be observed that the right of
action is given firstly to the father or, in case of his death, to the mother,
notwithstanding that the unmarried daughter was at the time of her seduction
serving or residing with another person upon hire or otherwise; and proof of
acts of service in such case is dispensed with and no evidence shall be
received to the contrary. Secondly it is provided that in case the father or
mother had before the seduction abandoned the daughter and refused to provide
for and retain her as an inmate, then any other person who might at common law
have maintained an action for the seduction may maintain such action. Thirdly
it is pro

[Page 332]

vided that any person other than the
father or mother ""who by reason of the relation of master or
otherwise"" would have been entitled at common law to maintain an action
for the seduction of an unmarried female may still maintain such action (and
the following words are very significant),

if the father or mother is not resident
in Alberta at the time of the birth of the child which is born in consequence
of the seduction or being resident therein does not bring an action for the
seduction within six months from the birth of the child.

Those are all the provisions of the statute save and except the
last section, section 5. Now those provisions necessarily import as an
essential ingredient of the cause of action an illegitimate child born or
conceived as a result of the relations complained of. And that, I believe, has
always been the common understanding in Canada of the cause of action for
seduction. It is not without its own significance that counsel have not been
able to find any case in Canada where an action for seduction has succeeded
without proof of at least pregnancy, and no reported case in England since Manvell
v. Thomson[8]. Not
only was the question not raised in that case, but the case was prior to the
legislation enacted in Upper Canada in 1837, being 7 William IV, chap. 8,
""An Act to make the remedy in cases of seduction more effectual, and to
render the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support,""
which statute without substantial change became the law of the province, of
Ontario at Confederation and (except that the provisions for the maintenance of
illegitimate children were carried forward in a separate statute) remained
substantially unchanged until 1903, when the North West Territories enacted the
Ontario statute verbatim and added thereto the section which is now section 5
in the Alberta revised statute.

Section 5 uses the same words as used throughout the other
sections of the statute. ""Any unmarried female who has been seduced""
are the same words as used in section 2. The words ""an action for
seduction"" in section 5 are substantially the same as ""an action for
the seduction"" that are used throughout the statute. Then there is the
general heading: ""Persons entitled to maintain action."" The words in
section 5, ""Notwithstanding anything in this

[Page 333]

Act,"" mean, I think, that
notwithstanding that the action for seduction may be maintained by the several
classes of persons referred to in the preceding sections, the unmarried female
may herself maintain the action, and the words ""in the same manner as an
action for any other tort"" refer to the procedure for maintaining in her
own name the right of action and are not words creating the substance of a new
cause of action.

It is a safe rule of statutory interpretation to assume, in the
absence of an expressed intention to the contrary, that a Legislature when it
uses the same words in different sections of the same statute, particularly a
very short statute, uses the words in the same sense throughout the statute.
Are we to interpret section 5 so as to import into the words used in that
section a different quality or meaning from that which the same words have in
the other sections of the statute? If the Legislature had intended that the
words in section 5 should mean something different from what they mean in the
other sections, the Legislature could have said so. Of course, where the right
of action is given to the unmarried female herself there is necessarily
excluded the relation of master and servant as an essential in the cause of
action and with it the necessity for proof of loss of service; but the
substance of the statutory cause of action, the birth of a child or at least
the condition of pregnancy, remains. Again, with the greatest deference to
those from whom I differ, I cannot see that the re-enactment of the statute in
the revision of 1922 touches the point as to the substance of the cause of
action, because the fact of the birth of a child, or pregnancy, in the Alberta
cases prior to the revision has been admitted or accepted by counsel and those
cases did not turn upon that question.

In the view I take of this appeal, it becomes unnecessary to
examine minutely the evidence at the trial, as we were invited by counsel for
the respondent to do, to ascertain whether or not the jury was justified in
arriving at its verdict of guilt against the respondent. In my opinion, the
evidence discloses no cause of action and therefore the action was properly
dismissed.

[Page 334]

The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON PROPOSED APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF
NOVA SCOTIA, EN BANC

Criminal law—Appeal—No possible appeal to
Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1025, Cr. Code, by person found guilty on
summary conviction.

There is no possible appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada under s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  by a person found
guilty on summary conviction under Part XV of the Code. S. 1025 , under the
special conditions

[Page 137]

therein mentioned, applies to an appeal by a
person convicted of an indictable offence, and this really means a conviction
on indictment as would appear from s. 1013. (S. 765, and Attorney-General of
Alberta v. Roskiwich, [1932] S.C.R. 570, also cited.)

APPLICATION under s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code  for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
en banc affirming (on appeal by way of stated case under s. 761  of the Criminal
Code ) the conviction of the present applicant by a police magistrate on the
trial on the information and complaint that he did ""without lawful
authority or without a permit signed by the Minister or some person authorized
by him in that behalf, have in his possession a drug, to wit, opium, contrary
to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and amendments thereto"".

Gordon Henderson for the applicant.

C. Stein for the
respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—In this case the appellant was found guilty on
summary conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code .

I have come to the conclusion that the case does
not come within section 1025  of the Criminal Code . That section, under
the special conditions therein mentioned, applies to an appeal by a person
convicted of an indictable offence; and this really means a conviction on
indictment as would appear from section 1013 of the Code.

There is no possible appeal under section 1025 
by a person found guilty on summary conviction.

Moreover, the judgment a quo was rendered
on a stated case and, under sec. 765  of the Criminal Code , such an order
is final and conclusive upon all parties. (Attorney-General for Alberta v.
Roskiwich[1]).

The motion, therefore, will be dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Written
confession—Statement in confession admitting theft of a revolver—Evidence at
trial that revolver was weapon with which deceased killed—Admissibility of
whole confession—Relevancy of theft—Effect of judgment of this Court in
Thiffault v. The King [1933] S.C.R. 509—Comments as to extent of that decision
as to the admissibility of a confession in whole or in part.

On a charge of murder the possession by accused of the weapon
(revolver), with which the murder was committed, at the time of the killing was
a relevant fact to be proved by the Crown. The evidence of the theft of the
revolver was admissible; it was admissible because it was relevant as showing
how the accused obtained possession of the revolver. Therefore the mention of
the fact that the revolver was stolen in the confession of the accused did not
vitiate that confession as evidence.

In Thiffault v. The King ([1933] S.C.R. 509),
the decision of this Court was that the evidence pointed to the conclusion that
the statement tendered in evidence was not a correct statement of what the
accused had said and intended to say; and it was also held that a document,
professing to embody the effect of admissions obtained in the way the
admissions were obtained in that case and containing inter alia a record
of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible as evidence against the
accused and was calculated to prejudice him, ought not to be admitted as
evidence against him.

The decision of this Court in the Thiffault case does
not lay down that, where a document contains a true record of a declaration by
an accused which, it is established to the satisfaction of the trial judge, was
a voluntary statement in the pertinent sense, the whole declaration must
necessarily be excluded because it contains a statement of some irrelevant
fact. If the declaration was obtained in circumstances and in a manner which
makes it otherwise unobjectionable, and if the statement of the irrelevant fact
can be separated from the rest of the document without in any way affecting the
tenor of it, then the trial judge in most cases would probably be able to
effect the exclusion of the objectionable statement while permitting the
unobjectionable part of the document to go before the jury. To this course in
such circumstances there could be no objection. Rex v. Sampson
(62 C.C.C. 49, at 51) approved, subject to the observations in the judgment.
But where a written declaration by an accused contains statements of facts
prejudicial to the accused and not relevant to the issue, the trial judge may
find it necessary to scrutinize with exceptional care the circumstances in
which the declaration has been obtained.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1943] 2 W.W.R. 449; [1943] 3
D.L.R. 584) affirmed.

[Page 74]

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of murder.

The accused (appellant), when
being interviewed by the police with respect of the theft of revolvers from a
barracks, handed over a revolver then in his possession and confessed that he
had stolen it. After a third and final interview had been apparently concluded,
the accused blurted out ""I killed Phil Davis"", a taxi-driver. No
mention of Davis had previously been made during the first two
interviews. The usual warning had been given and the accused's confession was
taken down in writing and signed by him; it included the theft of the revolver.
The written statement embodying both confessions was admitted in evidence at
the trial, after it had been found, following a ""trial within the
trial"", to have been free and voluntary. The trial judge instructed the
jury they could find the appellant guilty of murder, either on the confession
itself, or apart from it, on his evidence given in the witness-box when he
repudiated the confession and explained his possession of the deceased's watch
and flashlight. The accused was convicted of murder. On appeal to the Court of
Appeal, it was contended that the testimony of the theft was not material,
since there was ample evidence of the accused's possession of the revolver, and
that such testimony was not only irrelevant to the charge of murder but was
also prejudicial to the accused. The majority of the appellate court held that,
under all the circumstances, the fact of the illegal possession of the revolver
was admissible and that the appeal should be dismissed. The accused appealed to
this Court, and the appeal was dismissed.

P. D. Murphy for the appellant.

J. A. Clark K.C. for the
respondent.

At the conclusion of the argument
by the appellant's counsel, without calling upon counsel for the respondent,
the Chief Justice, speaking for the Court, delivered the following oral
judgment:

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—Mr. Clark, we
think it will not be necessary to call upon you.

We have had the advantage of an
admirable argument from Mr. Murphy; and what I am saying now, in a very

[Page 75]

summary way, is, first, that we
are satisfied that evidence of the theft of the revolver was admissible and
that mention of the circumstance that the revolver had been stolen in the
confession does not vitiate it.

As regards the application that
has been made, we have come to the conclusion that we ought not to accede to
that application, because we are satisfied there is no conflict between the
decision of the Court of Appeal in this case and the decision referred to, in
the relevant sense.

I must add, however, that a
decision of this Court in the Thiffault case (1) was the subject of
discussion in the Court below and we think it is possible that there has been
some misapprehension of the effect of that judgment in that case, and for that
reason we think some explanation should be given on that point. We will,
therefore, give some reasons later.

The appeal will be dismissed.

Some time later, the following
written reasons for judgment were delivered by the Chief Justice speaking for
the Court.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—In the reasons
given on the 7th of October, 1943, in this appeal, it was stated that there
would be further reasons dealing with a point raised as to the application of Thiffault
v. The King[2].
As was stated in those reasons, we are satisfied that the evidence of the theft
of the revolver was admissible; it was admissible because it was relevant as
showing how the accused obtained possession of the revolver. Therefore, the
mention of the fact that the revolver was stolen in the confession of the
accused does not vitiate that confession as evidence.

In Thiffault v. The
King[3]
it was necessary to consider a declaration which had been received in evidence
against the accused. The accused on the occasion on which the declaration was
signed had been interrogated by a detective whose questions were directed to
ascertaining not only the connection of the accused with the fire in which his
wife had lost her life, but also to obtaining admissions of damaging facts in
his past history. The clerk who was present made what professed to be a record
of the effect of the statements of the accused, which the latter signed after
it had been read to him. Admittedly

[Page 76]

the statement contained one most
serious error, highly prejudicial to the accused. It also contained a statement
that the accused had once been arrested for fighting and that he had paid the
costs. The clerk who drew up the statement was not produced as a witness and no
adequate explanation for his absence was given. Other witnesses who were
present during the interrogation were not produced. Apart altogether from any
question touching the voluntariness of the statement, this Court took the view
that

the evidence points to the
conclusion that, although the document was read over to him before he signed
it, it is not a correct statement of what the accused said and intended to say.

We also considered that a
document professing to embody the effect of admissions obtained in the way the
admissions were obtained in that case, and containing inter alia a
record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible as evidence against
the accused and was calculated to prejudice him, ought not to be admitted as
evidence against him.

The judgment in that case does
not lay down that where a document contains the record of a declaration by an
accused which, it is established to the satisfaction of the trial judge, was a
voluntary statement in the pertinent sense, the whole declaration must
necessarily be excluded because it contains a statement of some irrelevant
fact. If the declaration was obtained in circumstances and in a manner which
make it otherwise unobjectionable, and if the statement of the irrelevant fact
can be separated from the rest of the document without in any way affecting the
tenor of it, then the trial judge in most cases would probably be able to
effect the exclusion of the objectionable statement while permitting the
unobjectionable part of the document to go before the jury. To this course in
such circumstances there could be no objection.

Subject to what has just been
said, we are in agreement with the judgment of Mellish J. in Rex v. Sampson[4].

Of course, where a written
declaration by an accused contains statements of facts prejudicial to the
accused and not relevant to the issue, the trial judge may find it necessary to
scrutinize with exceptional care the circumstances in which the declaration has
been obtained.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Accused charged on three counts
of conspiracy—Speedy trial before Court of Sessions—Only one trial on the three
charges—Only one complaint or information charging accused with the three
charges, one preliminary inquiry and one option—Not the same as if several
counts arise from separate informations and commitments, each charging distinct
offences—This case distinguished from decision of this Court in The King v.
Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317).

[Page 436]

The accused, respondents, were charged on
five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to commit
indictable offences and two for having committed the substantive offences
themselves. The trial having been limited to the three conspiracy counts, the
accused, having elected to be tried speedily under part 18 of the Criminal
Code , were found guilty, but on appeal the conviction was set aside and a new
trial was ordered. The decision of the appellate court was based on the ground
that the trial judge upon speedy trial had no jurisdiction to try the three
different counts in the indictment at the same time, that Court being of the
opinion that it was contrary to the rule laid down by this Court in The King
v. Balciunas ([1943] S.C.R. 317). The Crown appealed to this Court, leave
having been granted under section 1025  of the Criminal Code .

Held that the
appeal should be allowed. The judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case
(supra) should not be considered as governing the present case, the true
effect of that decision being that it is limited in its restriction of trial to
cases where the several counts arise from separate informations and
commitments.

The procedure was different in the two cases.
In the present case, there was only one complaint which charged the respondents
with the three conspiracy offences, there was only one preliminary inquiry
referring to the three counts and there was only one charge sheet and one option.
In the Balciunas case (supra), three separate informations were
laid, each charging a distinct offence; there was a commitment for trial in
each of the cases, although the three charges were set forth on a single Charge
sheet, there was one speedy trial on all three Charges and the accused was
convicted on each charge. Therefore, in the Balciunas decision, it was a
case of a joinder for trial purposes of charges originating in different
complaints, or in different and distinct commitments, or, in short, a joinder
of different cases; and it was held that it was improper to try the three
separate charges together.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which allowed the respondents'
appeal on questions of law and ordered a new trial, without giving any decision
on questions of facts.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now
reported.

Gérald Fauteux K.C. and Gustave Adam K.C.
for the appellant.

Philippe Monette K.C. and M. Gameroff
K.C. for the respondents.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin
and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

[Page 437]

The Chief
Justice.—The respondents were, by the Court of Sessions
sitting in and for the district of Montreal, found guilty on three counts of
conspiracy on which they had been tried. These counts of conspiracy formed part
of a single charge sheet. The accused were charged with having conspired to
commit a number of offences and also, on two other counts, with having
committed the substantive offences themselves. Upon objection of the
respondents, by way of motion to quash, against the joinder of the conspiracy
charges and of the two other charges for having committed the substantive
offences, the hearing of the two latter counts was adjourned and the case
proceeded only upon the conspiracy charges, to the joinder of which, at that
particular time, no objection was forthcoming from the respondents.

Against the conviction on the three counts of conspiracy,
the respondents appealed on questions of law and on questions of facts.

By judgment rendered on the 30th of December,
1943, the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) unanimously allowed the appeal on
the questions of law and ordered a new trial; but, although the Court had heard
counsel for the parties both on the law and on the facts, no reference either
in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment was made to the appeal on
questions of facts.

The decision of the Court was that the presiding
judge, upon speedy trial under part 18 of the Criminal Code , had no
jurisdiction to try the three different counts in the indictment at the same
time, as he had done; that this was contrary to the rule laid down by the
Supreme Court of Canada in The King v. Balciunas[1]. For that reason the
conviction was quashed and the Court ordered a new trial.

Although the formal judgment of the Court of
King's Bench states that the respondents took exception to the mode of trial,
it now appears that this was a mistaken impression and that the trial proceeded
and the accused were found guilty without raising the objection which they
alleged in their notice of appeal.

The Crown moved for leave to appeal to this
Court, under section 1025  of the Criminal Code , alleging conflict

[Page 438]

in a like case between the judgment now appealed
from and the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in the case of The
King v. Cross[2].
Leave to appeal was granted.

There is no doubt about the jurisdiction of the
learned judge who gave leave, because the conflict is evident. In the Cross
case2
the Court decided that a judge holding a speedy trial may deal with each charge
as the counts in one indictment might be dealt with and is not bound to proceed
with a speedy trial upon each formal charge. There was, as here, only one
information. The Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia held that the magistrate had
jurisdiction to try together the three charges there referred to and that the
several charges were not to be treated as separate indictments and to be tried
separately. The conviction was affirmed.

The judgment rendered by the Court of King's
Bench in the present case is, therefore, clearly in conflict with the Cross case2,
and the case comes under section 1025  of the Criminal Code , unless it may be
said that the judgment of this Court in the Balciunas case[3] overruled the judgment in the Cross case2
and that the Court of King's Bench of Quebec only followed the decision
rendered in this Court in the Balciunas case3.

Leave having been granted, the Court first heard
the appeal during the May sittings and judgment was then reserved; but, in the
course of its deliberations, the Court felt there were points on which it would
like to have a reargument. Accordingly counsel were advised that they were
called upon to argue the following points:—

Whether, under the judgment of this Court
in the Balciunas case,3 in no case can more than one count be
the subject of trial under Part 18 of the Code at the same time, or whether the
judgment is limited in its restriction of trial to cases where the several
counts arise from separate informations and commitments.

Counsel on both sides had full opportunity to be
heard on the points thus submitted.

The reargument took place at the present
sittings of the Court. Counsel for the Attorney-General for the province of
Quebec took the position that the second alternative in

[Page 439]

the question submitted by the Court was the
correct one and that to which one should adhere. I have come to the conclusion
that the latter view is the true effect of the Balciunas judgment[4]. As appears in the judgment of the Court,
the facts in that case were as follows:—

Three separate informations were laid against
Balciunas. He was committed for trial on all three. A single charge sheet
setting forth the three charges was prepared by the Crown Prosecutor and on
this the accused was arraigned and elected to be tried speedily under part 18
of the Criminal Code . There was one trial on all three charges before the
County Court judge and Balciunas was convicted on each charge. On appeal to the
Court of Appeal this conviction was set aside/and a new trial directed on the
ground that it was improper to try the three separate charges together, the
point being that, although there was authority in the Criminal Code  to include
in an indictment a number of separate charges, this was not the case as to a
charge under the provisions of part 18. In this Court the judgment of the Court
of Appeal was affirmed.

In the present case the procedure was different.
There was only one complaint which charged the respondents with the three
conspiracy offences. There was only one preliminary inquiry referring to the
three counts, and there was only one charge sheet and one option.

A motion to quash was made, but it objected to
the joinder of the conspiracy charges with the other charges of having
committed the offences themselves; it did not object to the joinder of the
three conspiracy charges.

As appears, there was a single complaint, a
single inquiry, a single charge comprising the three counts, a single
option in relation to that charge, and a single trial on the three counts. No
objection was made to having the conspiracy counts tried simultaneously, and
objection was made only to the joinder with the substantive offences counts.

The procedure, therefore, was different in the
two cases and I do not think the Balciunas judgment[5] should be considered as governing the
present case. What the Court had before it in the Balciunas case5
was the fact of three separate informations, a commitment for trial on all
three

[Page 440]

and a single charge sheet on which the trial
proceeded to conviction on all three charges. The Court did not pretend to
decide anything else than what was then before it. The effect of the judgment
is that, in the premises, it was improper to try the three charges together;
and the decision should not be extended to a different case. Speaking broadly,
however general the terms may be in which a judgment is expressed, unless a
contrary intention clearly appears, they extend only to the facts and to the
questions with which the Court is at the moment concerned.

In the Balciunas case[6] what was condemned was the joinder for
trial purposes of charges originating in different complaints, or different
informations, the joinder of separate records, or, in short, of different
cases. It should not, therefore, be considered as concluding this particular
case.

Now, as can be seen by the notice of appeal,
there was substantially only one ground of appeal on the law before the Court
of King's Bench in Quebec. The respondents contended that the trial judge had
exceeded his jurisdiction in hearing simultaneously three counts in the
indictment. Likewise, the Court of King's Bench decided that contention
favourably to the respondents by resting its decision on the Balciunas judgment6;
but, in my opinion, the two cases are different and, as this was the real
ground of the decision in the Court of King's Bench, it follows that the appeal
ought to be allowed.

However, this does not dispose of the case.
There was an appeal to the Court of King's Bench not only on the question of
law just discussed, but also on questions of fact. The respondents were
entitled to a pronouncement by the Court of King's Bench on their appeal on facts.
In view of the result on the question of law, the Court of King's Bench gave no
decision on the appeal on facts. The case ought, therefore, to be remitted to
the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec in order that
that Court may pass upon the grounds of appeal based on facts. In so ordering,
I am adopting the course followed by this Court in The King v. Boak[7].

The appeal should be allowed to the extent
indicated.

[Page 441]

The judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was
delivered by

Rand J.—The respondents were charged before the Court of Sessions,
district of Montreal, under the speedy trials provisions of the Criminal Code 
on five counts, one for conspiracy to commit fraud, two for conspiracy to
commit indictable offences against sections 164  and 169  of the Excise Act , and
two for those offences themselves. The charges had been laid in one information
and the commitment was on all of them. On the objection of the respondents and
with the consent of the Crown, the trial was limited to the conspiracy counts.
The accused were found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside and
new trials ordered. From that judgment the Attorney-General of Quebec appeals.

The ground on which the Court of King's Bench
proceeded was that under part 18 of the Code, as interpreted by this court in
the case of The King v. Balciunas[8],
no more than one count or charge can be the subject of such a trial. But that
was not, in my opinion, the effect of the Balciunas judgment8
nor do I think it governs this case. An examination of its facts shows that
three informations had been laid, each charging a distinct offence. There was a
commitment in each case. The three charges, however, were set forth on one
charge sheet; on them the accused elected for a speedy trial and they were
tried together. It was, therefore, a case of joining charges contained in
separate and distinct commitments. The Court of Appeal for Ontario had held
that there was no power under part 18 to do that and that section 834 had no
application because all three were contained in the commitments; and it had
directed

that the appellant be tried regularly upon
the charges upon which he was committed for trial.

That judgment was affirmed in this court (1). In
both, reference was made to section 856 of part 19 of the Criminal Code  and
assuming that section would have cured what was otherwise a misjoinder, it was
held not to apply to proceedings under part 18.

[Page 442]

These judgments imply that, if the three charges
had been properly on the charge sheet, they could have been tried together, and
this is clearly the assumption underlying section. 856 in relation to an
indictment. If the question had been simply whether there was jurisdiction
under part 18 to try two charges together, it would have been quite unnecessary
to emphasize the precise procedure followed or to make any reference to section
834.

Then does part 18 exclude all joinder of counts
in a charge sheet? The commitment on the five charges was unobjectionable.
Section 827 requires, for the purposes of election, that the prisoner be
informed that he is charged with ""the offence"", which ordinarily
means that upon which he has been committed, but the singular number is not to
be taken as a limitation. By subsection 3,

the prosecuting officer shall prefer the
charge against the accused for which he has been committed for trial or any
charge founded on the facts or evidence disclosed on the depositions.

Section 834 has already been considered. Section
839, giving all powers of amendment, authorizes the division of a count under
section 891.

By the common law rule, an indictment could in
general contain any number of counts. In felonies, when it appeared that they
did not all arise out of the same body of facts, the court, not as a matter of
jurisdiction but of judicial discretion, followed this practice: if the
discreteness was detected before the prisoner pleaded, the court would quash
the indictment; if it did not appear until after plea, the prosecutor was
called upon to elect upon which count he would proceed; but after verdict the
joinder was not available on a writ of error. So long, however, as the counts
were statements of different offences arising out of what was in substance a
single transaction, there was no misjoinder and all could be tried together: The
King v. Lockett et al.[9],
and in this background both the purpose of section 856 and the interpretation
of part 18 are clarified. If a joinder of two or more counts, arising as in
this case, were not allowed, then either speedy trials would be limited to
commitments on a single charge or a separate trial would be necessary for each
of any number of charges

[Page 443]

although they all arose out of the same
transaction, and the real object of part 18 would, in large measure, be
defeated. Section 710 in part 15 shows with what specific language such a
limitation of trial has been prescribed.

The ground, then, upon which the court below
proceeded lay in a misconception of what the Balciunas judgment (1)
decided and the appeal must be allowed but, as the accused had appealed as well
on the facts and this ground has not been considered below, I would return the
case to the Court of King's Bench to be dealt with accordingly.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Burglary—Possession
by night of implements of house-breaking—Ordinary tools of the accused's trade
as truck driver—Prooj of unlawful purpose—Lawful excuse—Onus of proof—Evidence—Sufficiency—Criminal
Code , section 464a .

The appellant, a truck driver, was charged with having been
found in possession by night, without lawful excuse, of instruments of house
breaking, contrary to section 464a  of the Criminal Code  and was convicted
before a judge of the County Court. The trial judge found that some of the
instruments, but not all of them, were tools a truck driver might use in his
trade, while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for
purposes of housebreaking. But he further stated that he was satisfied, in all
the surrounding circumstances established in evidence, that at that particular
time and place the tools were not in the appellant's possession for an innocent
purpose, and, ""on the whole of the evidence"", he found the appellant

[Page 10]

guilty. The conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court
of Appeal. The dissenting judge was of the opinion that the trial judge failed
to apply the principle in Rex v. Ward (85 L.J.K.B. 483), where it
was held that the accused had prima facie satisfied the onus cast upon
him of proving that he had a lawful excuse for his possession of the tools and
that the onus was then cast upon the prosecution of proving affirmatively that
the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of the tools at that
particular time and place.

Held, Kellock J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances
of this case and upon the evidence, the trial judge was legally warranted in
drawing the conclusions he arrived at. The decision in Rex v. Ward
(supra) does not apply. In that case, the trial judge had directed the jury
that it was for the accused to establish to their entire satisfaction that his
possession of the implements was lawful; while the Court of Criminal Appeal
held that the jury had not been properly directed with regard to the onus of
proof. In the present case the trial judge was sitting alone without a jury; it
was not necessary for him to expound the law and then verbally apply it to the
facts in giving his reasons for judgment; and it should be sufficient if it
appears he was alive to the law and that he properly charged himself when
reaching his finding upon the evidence. Moreover, the findings alone would be
sufficient to take this case out of the application of the Ward case.

Per Kellock J. dissenting:—The trial judge did not
properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in the Ward
case. Therefore, the question for decision is as to whether or not he must
""inevitably"" have come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on
the evidence, notwithstanding such misdirection; and this must depend upon
whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused had possession with guilty intent. The circumstances disclosed
in evidence upon which the Crown can rely are not sufficient to make the
result, that the accused was guilty, inevitable. There should be a new trial.

APPEAL by Mihalchan, one of
the accused, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
dismissing (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, on a
trial before the County Court of Westminster, Whiteside J., on a charge of
being found by night in possession of instruments of housebreaking without
lawful excuse, contrary to section 464  (a) of the Criminal Code .

The appellant and one Smylski
were charged jointly with possession of housebreaking instruments. The
implements consisted of a substantial assortment of tools, together with a
piece of celluloid, found in the car the

[Page 11]

appellant was driving. The trial
judge acquitted Smylski but convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six
months' imprisonment.

No one appearing for the
appellant.

E. Pepler K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—The appellant
was convicted in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court at New Westminster,
B.C., of having been found in possession by night, without lawful excuse, of
instruments of housebreaking, contrary to section 464  (a) of the
Criminal Code .

The conviction was affirmed by
the Court of Appeal, but there was a dissent in that Court and the appeal here
is on the question on which there has been dissent.

In the formal judgment appealed
from the dissent is expressed thus:—

Mr. Justice O'Halloran
dissents from this judgment upon the grounds that the trial judge misdirected
himself as to the onus of proof and failed to apply the correct legel
principles in considering the explanation of the appellant in relation to his
possession of the alleged housebreaking instruments and in discharging the onus
placed upon him by section 464  (a) of the Criminal Code .

In his reasons the learned
dissenting judge stated that, in his opinion, the trial judge failed to apply
the principle in Rex v. Ward[2]
. The point would be that when once the instruments found in the possession of
the accused, although capable of being used for purposes of housebreaking, are
also shown to be the ordinary tools which the accused might well use in his trade,
the accused thus establishes prima facie a sufficient excuse, and the
burden shifts upon the prosecution of satisfying the jury, from the other
circumstances, that the accused had no lawful excuse for being in possession of
these tools at that particular time and place.

In the Ward case[3]
, the Deputy Chairman had directed the jury that it was for the accused to
establish to their satisfaction that his possession of the implements in ques-

[Page 12]

tion was lawful. It was held by
the Court of Criminal Appeal that the jury had not been properly directed with
regard to the onus of proof and the appeal was allowed.

In the present case the trial
judge was sitting alone without a jury. It was not necessary for him to expound
the law and then verbally apply it to the facts in giving his reasons for
judgment. It should be sufficient if it appears he was alive to the law and
that he properly charged himself when reaching his finding upon the evidence. (The
King v. Frank[4]
).

Here no error in direction, or
self-direction, was made manifest and the learned judge's reasons do not
warrant the conclusion that he misdirected himself, or that he proceeded upon
an erroneous view of the law, and this is not to be assumed.

The appellant is a truck driver
and the learned judge found that some of the instruments in the appellant's
possession—but not all of them—were tools a truck driver might use in his
trade; while all of the instruments so found were capable of being used for
purposes of housebreaking. These findings alone would be sufficient to take the
case out of the application of Rex v. Ward.[5]
.

But, moreover, the learned judge
was satisfied, in all the surrounding circumstances established in evidence,
that at that particular time and place the tools were not in the appellant's
possession for an innocent purpose; and, as stated in his judgment, ""on
the whole of the evidence"" the learned judge found the appellant guilty.

It was recognized in the Ward
case[6]
that ""other circumstances"" might displace the prima facie
proof, or show a guilty intent, and it was, of course, for the learned trial
judge in the present case, acting as judge and jury, to say whether or not, in
the particular circumstances, the possession was innocent.

With deference, I do not see here
any misdirection on the part of the trial judge and I think, in the
circumstances and upon the evidence, he was legally warranted in drawing the
conclusions he arrived at.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 13]

KELLOCK J. (dissenting).—All the
members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that, with the exception of the
piece of celluloid, all the tools found in the possession of the accused were
tools which the accused might reasonably require in his occupation as a truck
driver in Northern British Columbia. The possession of such tools, excepting
the celluloid, was then prima facie explained. (Rex v. Ward[7].)
The learned trial judge believed the statement of the accused that the
celluloid had come into his possession with the car when he purchased the
latter some months earlier. O'Halloran J.A. who dissented did so because in his
view the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in failing to apply the
principle of the above decision with the result that the evidence was never
properly considered from the standpoint of the burden under which the Crown
came by reason of the explanation furnished by the accused's occupation for his
possession of the tools, excepting the celluloid.

A reading of the judgement at
trial, coupled with the learned judge's report, satisfies me that the learned
judge did not properly direct himself as to the law applicable as laid down in Rex
v. Ward[8]
. In his report he says that the accused's excuse for being on his way to Port
Haney seemed flimsy

when heard in connection
with his explanation of why he happened to have such a complete housebreaking
equipment in his truck

(he should have said car). The
explanation of the accused for his possession of the tools apart from the
celluloid by reason of his occupation was perfectly good, and as I have said,
was so regarded by all the members of the Court of Appeal, and as to the
celluloid, the learned judge believed the accused when he said it had come with
the car. To my mind the above passage indicates that the learned judge paid no
attention to the fact that the tools were tools of the accused in connection
with his occupation and regarded the burden imposed by section 464  (a)
Cr. C. as never having been other than throughout on the accused.

If that be so the question for
decision is as to whether or not the learned trial judge must inevitably have
come to a conclusion of the guilt of the accused on the evidence,

[Page 14]

notwithstanding the misdirection;
Stirland v. Public Prosecutor[9]
. This must depend upon whether the Crown discharged the onus of establishing
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession with guilty intent.

The circumstances disclosed in
evidence upon which the Crown can rely is (1) the presence of the celluloid,[10]
the evidence as to the errand in Port Haney upon which the accused was engaged
at the time and (3) the evidence of the appellant and Smylski that they had
approached the garage thinking it was a place where they could buy cigarettes.

In my opinion there is no
""inevitability"" about the celluloid in view of the acceptance by the
learned trial judge of the explanation with regard to it, and if it amounts to
nothing it adds nothing to the other circumstances. As to number 2, its
coupling by the learned judge in his report, with the explanation by the
accused of his possession of the tools, as already pointed out, makes it
impossible for me to say he would not have believed this evidence had he not
been in error with regard to the tools. In addition there was a tailor by the
name of Mostrenko in Port Haney, and the learned judge has misapprehended this
part of the evidence as he refers to ""the very inadequate sum"" of
three dollars paid to the appellant by Smylski ""for the trip"". It was
not paid for the trip but for the gas which would be used on the trip. It was
therefore not an inadequate sum at all.

This leaves (3) above. What is
the evidence with regard to this? Smylski says:—

I thought I would go and buy
a chocolate bar, or soft drink. We got near the side-walk, and he (the
appellant) said ""It is closed"". And we were talking about it was too
far to go back, and then he said ""There is someone stealing the car"".
We ran back.

The appellant said:—

At that time I did'nt think
it was constable Saunders, but we passed the car, walking to the garage. We
stopped there and noticed there was it was not a business place at night, like
it was a confectionery; not in our line. We decided to turn back because it was
too far to go to town from there. It would be foolish. Either that or we would
have to go back. And sudden, I heard the car start, and I said ""Joe
somebody is stealing our car"".

Constable Saunders said that he
noticed the car, which later proved to be the appellant's, parked by the
roadside

[Page 15]

with its lights out. He stopped
and got out and before the appellant and Smylski came up he had been there long
enough to get into the car, start and stop the engine and get out of the car.
As he had driven past the garage previously he had noticed ""two figures
near the garage and I thought it was somebody just walking by"".

The reason given by the accused
and Smylski for leaving the car and approaching the garage was that they
thought it was a place where they could buy cigarettes. They had previously
driven past a number of places where they could have done so.

Would the learned trial judge
have refused to believe this as an explanation of the presence of the accused
near the garage or should he have done so, had he correctly approached a
consideration of all the evidences. With respect I find myself unable to say
that such a result was inevitable. I therefore think that there should be a new
trial and I would allow the appeal accordingly.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Accused, respondent, prosecuted
for alleged infractions of Order in Council dealing with maximum or ceiling
prices—Accused convicted after speedy trial under Part XV of the Criminal Code —Order
in Council by federal authorities creating leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada in cases of offences against wartime regulations—Regulations made by the
Order in Council—Extent of such right of appeal—Interpretation of the conditions
imposed by the Order in Council—Right of appeal to Supreme Court of Canada
still subject to sections 1023  and 1025  of the Criminal Code .

Under the provisions of the Criminal Code ,
there existed no right of appeal to provincial courts of appeal or to the
Supreme Court of Canada from judgments rendered on summary conviction under
Part XV of the Code. But right of appeal to these courts was allowed, on
certain conditions, by a federal order in council, coming into force on the 7th of June, 1943, from such judgments when
rendered on convictions for offences against wartime regulations. Certain
regulations were made and established by the order in council, amongst which
those material to this appeal read as follows: an appeal shall lie to a
provincial court of appeal, by leave of such court, on any ground which
involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact; a further appeal from the
judgment of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by
leave of such Court; and it was also regulated that ""sections 1023  to 1025 
inclusive of the Criminal Code  shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent
with this regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada***"".

Held: That the
effect of the regulations made by the order in council was not to give a right
of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

[Page 2]

from any and all judgments or decisions of a
provincial court of appeal, with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme
Court of Canada be given by that Court; but

Held: That the
result and effect of the regulations were that an appeal only lies to the
Supreme Court of Canada, by leave of that Court ""on any questions of law
on which there has been a dissent in the court of appeal"" (s. 1023  Cr. C).
or ""if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other
court of appeal in a like case"" (s. 1025  Cr. C). The provisions contained
in these two sections are not in any way inconsistent with the regulations and
must be taken into account in any appeal to this Court under the regulations
made by the order in council.

Therefore, applying to the appellant's
application for leave to appeal to this Court the regulations so interpreted,
the motion should be dismissed: there having been no dissent in the Court
below, this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave, as the applicant has not
shown that the judgment to be appealed from, in respect to the main point
involved in the appeal, conflicts with the judgment of any other court of
appeal in a like case.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal to this Court
from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,
allowing the respondent's appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench
(Crown side) and quashing the conviction of the respondent, after speedy trial
before the Court of Sessions of the Peace, for having committed infractions of
an Order of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The Court of King's Bench
(Crown side) had quashed the conviction in one out of ten charges, but had
affirmed the convictions in the others.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Gérard Lacroix K.C., for the application.

Chas. A. Cannon K.C. contra.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The appellant is an investigator of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board. The respondent, which is a manufacturer of
packing boxes, was prosecuted by the appellant, acting on behalf of the Board,
before the Court of the Sessions in the city of Quebec for ten alleged
infractions of order in council no. 8528, dated the 1st of November, 1941 (and
amendments thereto),

[Page 3]

which deals with maximum or ceiling prices at
which manufactured goods may be sold after the 1st day of December, 1941.

For the purpose of the present judgment, I do
not find it necessary to enter into the particulars of each one of these
charges (no. 22171 to no. 22180).

The accused was tried under Part XV of the
Criminal Code  and found guilty of all charges. It appealed to a judge of the
Court of King's Bench (Crown Side), who heard the appeals, quashed the
conviction in no. 22172, but affirmed the convictions in all the other cases.

By order in council no. 4600, which came into
force on the 7th of June, 1943, the Minister of Justice having reported

that in many of these prosecutions under
Part XV aforesaid, questions of law of first rate importance are not
infrequently raised relating to the validity and the construction of wartime
regulations and it has been represented to him that, in the interest of
uniformity of decisions, as well as the true construction of all wartime
regulations, further appeals should be allowed to the provincial courts of
appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada wherever, in the opinion of the Court to
be appealed to, an important question of law or of mixed law and fact is
raised, it was deemed necessary or advisable,

for the security, defence, peace, order and
welfare of Canada that such
appeals be provided for.

Certain regulations were accordingly made and
established and those which are material to the present appeal read as
follows:—

2. In any proceedings under Part XV of the
Criminal Code  for an offence against wartime regulations, an appeal from a
judgment of the county or district court judge, or in the province of Quebec,
the judge of the Court of King's Bench, Crown Side, on any ground of appeal
which involves a question of law or of mixed law and fact shall lie to the
court of appeal by leave of such Court.

3. A further appeal from a judgment or
decision of the court of appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada by
leave of such Court.

***

6. Sections 1023  to 1025  inclusive of the
Criminal Code  shall, insofar as the same are not inconsistent with this
regulation, apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada taken pursuant
to this regulation.

7. The Attorney General of Canada shall have a right of appeal in any
case where the Attorney General of the province in which the offence is alleged
to have been committed has such right.

The respondent secured from the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) (that Court being the court of appeal for

[Page 4]

the province of Quebec referred
to in the regulations) leave to appeal in the nine cases where the conviction
had been affirmed. The appeals were heard by that Court both on questions of
law and on questions of mixed law and fact. They were allowed in every one of
the cases and the nine convictions were quashed.

The appellant then moved for leave to appeal to
this court from these judgments of the Court of King's Bench under the
provisions of the Order in Council No. 4600.

In his notice of motion the appellant alleged
that the cases involved questions of public law and of the meaning and real
extent of the regulations enacted under the War Measures Act of Canada;
and that, amongst other questions, the Court was asked to decide mainly:—

9. (a) What may constitute a
sale during the basic period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War
Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in council no.
8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom;

(b) If the mens rea, or
criminal intent, constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order
in council no. 8528, and the orders flowing therefrom;

(c) Which is the meaning and the
extent of the reference to the Canadian Criminal Code in said order in council
no. 8528, and the orders made pursuant thereto.

The appellant further alleged that the decisions
of the courts up till now were not unanimous on these specific points and,
moreover, that the judgment rendered in the premises by the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) was in conflict with several other judgments of other
courts of appeal in similar cases, while the Supreme Court of Canada had never
so far decided these specific points in relation to the interpretation of the
regulations and orders enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of
Canada.

The petition for leave to appeal, as originally
served, did not indicate the judgments of the other courts of appeal alleged to
be in conflict with the decision appealed from. As a preliminary objection the
respondent, therefore, invoking the judgment in Liebling v. The King[1], argued that the Court
should not entertain the application.

The appellant, however, had subsequently served
an additional notice in which he referred to four different

[Page 5]

judgments which he alleged to be in conflict
with the judgment now appealed from and, as this additional notice was served
sometime before the motion came to be heard before the Court., it was thought that
this was a sufficient compliance with the rules of the Court and it was decided
that the respondent ""should take nothing"" by the objection so made by
him.

Another objection made by the respondent was
that, while both the Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side) had delivered two separate judgments on the matters now
before the Court, there was only one notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada and the respondent was entitled to be told from which of the two judgments
the appellant intended to appeal to this Court. The appellant, being requested
to optate between the two, thereupon declared that he abandoned the appeal from
the judgment rendered on the case numbered 22171 and bearing number 3573 in the
Court of King's Bench (Crown Side) and thus limited his appeal to the eight
other convictions and to the judgment in the appeal bearing number 3574 in the
Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).

Two questions stand to be decided on the
application for leave to appeal. The first one concerns the extent of the right
of appeal conferred by the regulations under order in council no. 4600. The
other question is whether, under those regulations as they must be interpreted,
the appellant has succeeded in making out before this Court a case where leave
to appeal ought to be granted to him in the circumstances.

Dealing with the first question. It must be
remembered that up till order in council no. 4600 there existed no right of
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from judgments rendered on summary
conviction under Part XV of the Criminal Code . (Attorney General for Alberta
v. Roskiwich[2];
Au Chung Lam alias On Lim v. The King[3].
The object of order in council no. 4600 is, amongst other things, to give a
right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in proceedings under Part XV of
the Criminal Code 

[Page 6]

for an offence against wartime regulations, but
such right of appeal is given only under certain conditions and what we have to
decide is precisely what those conditions are.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant
that the effect of the regulations under order in council no. 4600 is to give a
right of appeal from any and all judgments or decisions of the court of appeal,
with the sole proviso that leave of the Supreme Court of Canada be given by
that Court.

The respondent, however, questioned such an
interpretation of paragraph (3) of the regulations and argued that there was no
intention by order in council no. 4600 to change the ordinary conditions under
which an appeal could be brought to this Court, except that in these matters
leave of the Court itself would be required. As the law stood before, there was
a right to appeal de plano ""on any question of law on which
there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal""; and also

there was a right of appeal when the
judgment intended to be appealed from conflicted with the judgment of any court
of appeal in a like case, provided leave to appeal was granted by a Judge of
the Supreme Court of Canada.

This was under sections 1023  and 1025  of the
Criminal Code  and, in both instances, it applied only to proceedings in respect
of an indictable offence.

If we were to accept the appellant's
interpretation of the regulations, it would mean that no account should be
taken of paragraph (6) which enacts that

Sections 1023  to 1025  inclusive of the
Criminal Code  shall * * * apply to any appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
taken pursuant to this regulation.

This paragraph states that the sections
mentioned ""shall apply"" and, therefore, effect must be given to it
""in so far as the same are not inconsistent 'with these regulations"",
as stated in the paragraph.

Now, the only inconsistency with sections 1023 
to 1025  of the Criminal Code  that we can find in the regulations is the proviso
that the appeal lies to the Court only ""by leave of such Court"".
Otherwise the provisions contained in sections 1023  to 1025  are not in any way
inconsistent with the regulations and, therefore, must be taken into account in
any appeal to this Court under these new regulations. This

[Page 7]

interpretation is further strengthened by the
fact that if order in council no. 4600 were not to be construed as just
indicated, it would mean that appeals in proceedings upon summary convictions
under Part XV of the Criminal Code , which did not exist before the order in
council was passed, would, by such order in council, be made wider than appeals
in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. That, of course, would lead
to absurd consequences.

More particularly, having regard to the fact
that, by force of section (9) of the order in council no. 8528, the same
contravention, or failure, to observe any regulation, or order, constitutes an
offence which may be tried either upon summary conviction under Part XV, or, if
the Attorney General of Canada or of any province so directs, upon indictment.
So that the trial of the same offence, according as upon summary conviction or
upon indictment, would thus be made susceptible of an appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada under different conditions, and conditions which would be such
that the right of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences would
be more restricted than in proceedings upon summary conviction.

It is only reasonable to believe that the intent
of the order in council was to put the appeals in one or the other of these
matters upon the same footing, except that on indictable offences, as already
provided for by the Criminal Code , no leave is necessary when there has been in
the court of appeal a dissent on a question of law, or, where there has been no
dissent, a right of appeal lies by leave of a judge of the Court where the
judgment conflicts with that of another court of appeal in a like case; and in
proceedings on summary conviction under. Part XV of the Criminal Code  a new
right of appeal is created, where none existed before, and all the usual
conditions under sections 1023  to 1025  Cr. C. apply, except that in each case
no appeal lies unless the Supreme Court itself grants leave to appeal.

In our view, therefore, the effect and result of
the regulations under order in council no. 4600, so far as it applies to
appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, are as follows: In proceedings under
Part XV of the Criminal Code  for offences against wartime regulations an

[Page 8]

appeal now lies to the Supreme Court of Canada
by leave of that Court ""on any questions of law on which there has been
dissent in the court of appear (Criminal Code , section 1023 ), or ""if the
judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal
in a like case"" (Criminal Code , section 1025 ).

Applying to the present application for leave
the regulations so interpreted, as there has been no dissent in this case, this
Court has jurisdiction to grant leave only if it can be shown that the judgment
appealed from conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a
like case.

The appellant was able to suggest that such a
conflict existed only on two of the questions mentioned in his notice of
motion, one being:

If the mens rea, or criminal intent,
constitutes a necessary element in offences created by order in council no.
8528, and orders flowing therefrom;

the other being:

Which is the meaning and the extent of the
reference to the Canadian Criminal Code made in said order in council no. 8528,
and the orders made pursuant thereto.

Perhaps it should be noted that, after all, this
second question is really included in the first question.

But the appellant was unable to refer the Court
to any judgment of another court of appeal conflicting with the judgment
appealed from on the main point involved in the appeal, to wit:—

What may constitute a sale during the basic
period under regulations enacted pursuant to the War Measures Act of Canada and especially in virtue of order in
council no. 8528, as well as orders flowing therefrom.

The latter is really the fundamental point in
the proceedings against the respondent.

The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), held
that the proof made by the appellant of the alleged sales by the respondent
during the basic period were not sales within the meaning of order in council
no. 8528, but merely deliveries of articles covered by contracts of sale within
the meaning of the said order entered into long prior to the 15th day of
September, 1941. In consequence of that decision, the appellant has failed to
establish one of the two essential elements of the offences

[Page 9]

charged. The appellant, in view of the fact that
there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental
question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on
the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other
points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would
be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to
pass upon an academic question.

In the circumstances the appeal cannot be
entertained, leave to appeal should not be granted, and the motion to that
effect should be dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of rape—Evidence—Corroboration—Charge to
jury—Misdirection—New trial.

The appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario (81 C.C.C. 319) dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) appellant’s appeal
from his conviction on a charge of rape. The issue at the trial was whether or
not the complainant voluntarily consented to the intercourse. A witness, R.,
who had arrived at the scene of the alleged offence shortly after what took
place, testified to there being a “matted down” area of about 20 x 6 feet. The
complainant in her evidence had said nothing about such condition. Appellant
testified that such condition existed before what took place. In charging the jury
the trial Judge said that the evidence of R. and two other men corroborated the
complainant’s story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and he
followed by detailing certain matters of their evidence, including the
condition of the area as described by R.

Held (Taschereau and Kellock JJ. dissenting): The
conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.

Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: It was not
necessary that the complainant should have given some particular bit of
evidence before an independent witness upon that point could corroborate her
general story on the issue of consent. As part of the Crown’s case, it was
quite proper to show the condition of the particular area when R arrived, and
the jury would not be bound to believe appellant’s evidence as to its condition
before the occurrence. But it was misdirection to say that evidence of the
matted down condition of the area after the occurrence could constitute
corroboration of a material aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she
had not testified. And it could not be said that the misdirection had caused no
miscarriage of justice.

Per Rand J.: It was beyond controversy on the evidence
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the complainant’s story or to the case of the Crown.
The charge to the jury was, therefore, in that respect, a misdirection in law
and of such a nature that it could not be said that it might not have
influenced the jury in reaching their verdict.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ. (dissenting): The
reference in question in the charge to the condition of the area, having regard
to its context, related, not to any supposed statement of the complainant as to
the condition of the area which was corroborated by R., but to a reference
earlier in the charge to the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the
alleged assault, and would be so understood by the jury; and R.’s evidence as
to the condition of the area was consistent with, and could properly be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 135]

tive of, the complainant’s evidence with respect to the
struggle alleged by her to have taken place, unless it were clearly established
as a matter of fact that the struggle described by her was of such a limited
character that it could not have been the cause of an area of the extent
described by R., and on that question the jury, if accepting complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and was attacked, and giving due weight to
the circumstances, might well have considered that no difficulty arose, and
that was a question of fact, expressly left as such to, and entirely one for,
the jury. There was really no question of law involved in the dissent in the
Court of Appeal, but merely matters of fact, and therefore the appeal should be
quashed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Laidlaw J.A. dissenting) the appellant’s appeal from his
conviction, at trial before Greene J. and a jury, on a charge of rape.

H. Freshman for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.—The conviction of the appellant Mclntyre on a charge of
rape was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Laidlaw
dissenting. As I consider there should be a new trial, I refrain from
discussing the evidence except as it may be necessary to explain my reasons for
so doing.

If the offence occurred, there is no doubt that the appellant
committed it. He admits that he had intercourse with the complainant, Eva
Pettigrew, at the time and place mentioned by her but his defence is that she
consented voluntarily. The intercourse took place about noon on a bright
Sunday, May 23rd, 1943, not far from a travelled highway in the Township of Ancaster.
The exact spot is part of the abandoned right-of-way of an electric railway
company and is described in the evidence as being about twenty feet by six feet
in area. The ground surrounding it is filled with weeds and tall grass.

After the occurrence, Eva Pettigrew complained to one or more of
the occupants of a neighbouring farm house, one of whom described the condition
of the particular

[Page 136]

area immediately thereafter as “matted down”. There would appear
to be no denial of this fact but, in view of the defence, the important
question in this connection was as to the condition of that area before the
complainant and accused had reached it. The only one who gave any evidence on
this question was the accused, who said it was “well flattened” and “the only
matted down spot in the whole territory.”

The vital point in the whole case was as to whether the
complainant consented or, if she had consented, whether such consent had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm (Criminal Code , s. 298 ). The
trial judge told the jury that they “should be reluctant to convict in a case
of this kind upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant” but that “it
is within your power to do so.” He then dealt with the question “whether the
story of the complainant had been corroborated in a material aspect.” He stated
that the evidence of three people in the farm house “amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story.” He then detailed some of these aspects and stated, as one of
them:—“They described the condition of the area twenty feet by six where the
grass was pressed down”, and concluded:—“So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box here
to-day.” Later in his charge he said:—“She says that she did not consent, and
that she was overpowered by fear when he threatened her with bodily harm.
Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or evasion—it is for you
gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the grass and weeds there of
some twenty feet by six.”

It was pointed out in argument before us that the trial judge was
in error in stating that three occupants of the farm house had described the
condition of this lot where the grass was pressed down. As a matter of fact
only one had referred to it but, as we may deal only with the dissent in the
Court below, I disregard this discrepancy. All that was required was that the
corroboration should be of the evidence of the complainant that the accused had
carnal knowledge of her without her consent or with consent that had been
extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm

[Page 137]

It was not necessary that the complainant should have testified
to some particular bit of evidence before an independent witness upon that
point could corroborate her general story on the issue of consent. As part of
the Crown’s case, it was quite proper to show the condition of the particular
area when the independent witnesses arrived, and the jury would not be bound to
believe the evidence of the accused as to its condition before the occurrence.

However, that is not what the trial judge told the jury. He
instructed them that the evidence could be taken by them as corroborating her
story in regard to some of the material aspects thereof and then gave as one
aspect the condition of the area. As a matter of fact she had said nothing
about it. It was misdirection to say that evidence of the matted down condition
of the area after the occurrence could constitute corroboration of a material
aspect of the complainant’s story as to which she had not testified. It is in
this sense that I understand Mr. Justice Laidlaw’s statement:—“There could
not, of course, be corroboration, ample or otherwise, of evidence not given by
the complainant, Eva Pettigrew, and in my opinion there was a misdirection to
the jury in this matter.” In any event, later in his judgment he states:—“There
was again [referring to the same point] misdirection of such a character and
magnitude as to make the trial unfair to the appellant.”

In other parts of his charge, the trial judge had told the jury
that they were the sole judges as to what facts had been proved by the
evidence; that while it was his duty to review some of the highlights of the
evidence and to comment on them, if he saw fit, he could not pretend to review
everything and, if he expressed an opinion of the facts, they were not bound to
follow it unless their own opinion happened to be the same; and, towards the
conclusion of his charge, he stated that he did not pretend to have covered all
the evidence,—that there might be parts of it that were important that they
recalled which he had not gone over but that he was satisfied that among their
twelve joint memories they would have before them everything that was of any
real importance.

[Page 138]

These general observations, however, cannot weigh in this case
where the question of consent was of prime importance, nor does it matter that
the judge was right in pointing out other evidence which, if the jury believed
it, would warrant them in treating it as corroboration. There being
misdirection, I am unable to say that there has been no miscarriage of justice.
The fact that counsel for the accused did not object at the trial should not be
taken, in the circumstances, to indicate that the point was negligible. There
had already been one trial where the jury disagreed, and, considering the
evidence as a whole in the record before us and the importance attached to the
matted down area by the trial judge, the Crown has failed to convince me that
but for the misdirection the verdict would necessarily have been the same. Gouin
v. The King[2].

The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new
trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ., dissenting, was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.—This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a
charge of rape. Appellant relies upon the dissenting judgment of Laidlaw J.A.
as establishing jurisdiction in this Court pursuant to the provisions of
section 1023  of the Criminal Code .

The difference of opinion in the Court below was with regard to
certain portions of the charge of the learned trial judge. Laidlaw J.A. was of
opinion that there was material misdirection and that the Crown had not met the
onus thereby cast upon it of showing that there had been no miscarriage. The
Chief Justice of Ontario and Gillanders J.A. were of opinion that there was no
misdirection, the Chief Justice being further of the view that even if it could
be said that misdirection existed, it was quite improbable that it had had any
effect upon the result. The question in issue at the trial was as to whether or
not there had been consent on the part of the complainant, the defence being
that there had been such consent.

[Page 139]

In his charge, the learned trial judge said:

The evidence of the three gentlemen near by, the farmer Mr.
Robson, his father-in-law and his brother-in-law Scott, amply corroborates the
story as told by Eva Pettigrew in regard to some of the material aspects of
that story. In other words, they painted the scene as she has told it to you.
They found the man naked. They told you how she arrived at the house with
nothing but her skirt and jacket on, and they described (the condition of the
area twenty feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters
they corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness
box here to-day.

The complainant did not give any evidence with regard to the
condition of the area at any time. In the course of his judgment, Laidlaw J.A.,
after pointing this out, refers to the description given by complainant as to
her struggle with the appellant, and the evidence of the appellant that the
place in question was matted down at the time he and the complainant came
there. The ground of dissent was that Robson’s evidence could not amount to
corroboration of any evidence given by complainant either as to the condition
of the area or as to her struggle with the appellant, for the reason that she
had given no evidence as to the condition of the area and the extent of the
beaten down area described by Robson could not have been caused by the struggle
described by the complainant.

In considering whether or not there was misdirection in the
charge, the language of the learned trial judge is to be scrutinized to see
what the jury might reasonably be considered to have understood from it. It is,
of course, misdirection if a jury is directed to treat something as
corroboration which is not in law corroboration. In the present case, the
question is whether there is to be taken from what the learned trial judge told
the jury that the complainant had made some statement in evidence with regard
to the condition of the area which was corroborated by Robson, or whether his
charge is to be taken as referring only to her evidence as to her struggle, and
if the latter, then was the evidence of Robson in any way corroborative of it?

To my mind, the context in which the above portion of the charge
appears affords an answer to the first branch of the question.

The learned trial judge had first warned the jury that they
should be reluctant to convict upon the uncorroborated

[Page 140]

evidence of the complainant and pointed out that if they did so,
it was a very serious responsibility to assume unless her story had “been
corroborated in some material aspect”. He then proceeded to say:

It is proper that we should take just a moment to consider
as to whether the story of the complainant has been corroborated in a material
aspect. I think I need only recall to you her story as to what took place in
that gully or depression in the land that has been referred to, about her
clothes being removed, and the nature of the assault which she alleges
this man made upon her.

Then followed the portion of the charge which is objected to as
already set out above. In my opinion, the reference to the condition of the
area in the part objected to relates to the reference in the earlier part to
the complainant’s evidence as to the nature of the assault which she alleged
had been made upon her and, in my opinion, would be so understood by the jury.
The learned trial judge in a subsequent passage of his charge, returns to the
relation of the complainant’s evidence as to the assault and the existence of
the beaten down area and the bearing of the one upon the other when he said:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

I am of opinion, therefore, that in the portion of the charge
objected to as first set out above, there is no implication that the learned
trial judge was telling the jury that the complainant had made any statement
with regard to the condition of the beaten down area.

There remains to be considered the second branch of the question,
namely, as to whether or not the evidence of Robson could be properly regarded
as corroborative of the evidence of the complainant with respect to the
struggle which she alleged had taken place between herself and the appellant.
To put the matter another way, while the complainant had not said that the
grass was pressed down as the result of the struggle, she had given evidence of
a struggle and Robson’s evidence as to the condition he found would be
consistent with a struggle having taken place at that point and therefore
corroborative of the evidence of the complainant unless it were clearly
established as a matter of fact that the struggle described in evidence by the

[Page 141]

complainant was of such a limited character that it could not
have been the cause of an area of the extent described by Robson. In
considering this matter, it is to be remembered that if the complainant’s
evidence that she did not consent and that she was attacked was accepted by the
jury, the latter may well have considered that the complainant was not to be
held literally to her account of the struggle as she was not, in her agitated
condition in the circumstances of the attack, likely to have noted it in detail
or to have remembered it fully afterwards. Giving due weight to the
circumstances, the jury may well have considered that no difficulty arose in
this matter. In my view, this was a matter of fact entirely for the jury and no
ground is presented for interference by the court. This question of fact was
expressly left to the jury as such in the second passage of the charge to which
I have referred, namely: “Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six”. The learned dissenting judge
refers to this part of the charge but takes the view that the complainant’s
description of the struggle and the extent of the beaten down area were quite
inconsistent the one with the other. This is a finding of fact. With respect,
this was, in my opinion, a matter purely within the province of the jury.

The fact that appellant had given evidence that the area was
beaten down when he and the complainant first arrived at the place has no
relevancy to the point under discussion. The learned trial judge in the passage
of his charge referred to, was not dealing with any evidence given by the
appellant, but was dealing with the evidence of the complainant and some
aspects in which her evidence was corroborated by that of Robson. He had
already charged the jury—

There are two things that I wish to stress in regard to the
facts of the case as apart from the law: in my review I cannot pretend to
review everything; I try to assist you with a review of some of the more
important parts of the evidence, but that does not relieve you from your duty,
with your twelve joint memories, of recollecting and considering anything that
may be of importance in deciding the real issue

[Page 142]

in this case; and if I express an opinion on the facts, or
seem to express an opinion, you are not bound to follow my opinion unless your
own happens to be the same.

Viewing the evidence as I do, there is no question of law
involved in the dissent below, but merely matters of fact. I would, therefore,
quash the appeal.

RAND J.—This is an appeal by the accused from a conviction for
rape and comes here through the dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario of
Laidlaw, J.A., on a point of law.

The only issue at the trial was consent or no consent, and the
point on which the dissent arose was in relation to a portion of the judge’s
charge which dealt with corroboration.

The woman was twenty years of age and the young man eighteen. Her
story was of struggle until exhaustion, although terrified by threats of bodily
injury. The occurrence took place a short distance in the country from the city
of Hamilton in a low-lying area about twenty feet by six, over which the grass
had been beaten down until it was almost flat. Pictures of the surrounding land
indicated the grass to be fairly high and somewhat coarse and heavy.

A witness, who had reached the spot while the accused was still
there and naked, gave evidence of that state of the grass. The complainant had
not in her evidence referred to it. The accused gave a similar description of
it but added that it was in that condition when he and the complainant had come
to it. This latter feature was not challenged either in cross‑examination
or in rebuttal.

In his charge to the jury, the trial judge used the following
language:

They told you how she arrived at the house with nothing but
her skirt and jacket on, and they described the condition of the area twenty
feet by six where the grass was pressed down. So in several matters they
corroborated the evidence of Eva Pettigrew as she gave it in the witness box
here to-day.

And later in the charge:

Indicating that there was perhaps some struggle or
evasion—it is for you gentlemen to say—there was a beaten down area in the
grass and weeds there of some twenty feet by six.

[Page 143]

In the peculiar circumstances of the case presented,
extraordinary even as told by the complainant, and in view of the sole issue
before the jury, I doubt that any single suggestion could have carried more
weight to incline the balance of their judgment than that the grass in this
spot might have shown the condition it did as a result of her struggles. So far,
however, from that being the fact, it is beyond controversy, on the evidence,
that the state of the surface of the area could not have furnished the
slightest corroboration to the story of the complainant or to the case of the
Crown. It was, therefore, a misdirection in law and of such a nature that we
are quite unable to say that it might not have influenced the jury in reaching
their verdict.

The conviction should, therefore, be quashed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed, and new trial
directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Statements by accused
to police officers before charge or arrest made—Admissibility.

The appeal was from the affirmance by the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba (two Judges dissenting) of appellant's conviction of
having unlawfully received gasoline ration books, knowing them to have been
stolen. Two police officers, bearers of a search warrant, had gone to
appellant's home (before any charge or arrest was made) and talked to him, one
of them, EL, stating that ""it would be better"" for appellant to
return the books. At the end of their visit they told appellant that he was to
accompany them to the police barracks to talk to A., a police inspector, who,
on their arrival, talked to and questioned appellant. Later some gasoline
ration books were received by the police from some person through the mail. At
the trial, evidence was given, by the police officers of statements by
appellant in the aforesaid interviews, the evidence of A. in this respect being
that mainly relied on by the magistrate in convicting appellant. No ration
books had been found on appellant or in his home, nor was he identified at the
trial as one to whom stolen ration books had been sold or delivered.

Held: The
conviction should be quashed'.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: Evidence of statements by appellant to A. (and also of
statements by appellant to H., if they occurred after H.'s said statement) were
inadmissible, as having been made under fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority (Ibrahim v. The King, [1914]
A.C. 599, at 609; Sankey v. The King, [1927] S.C.R. 436, at 440).
On the record it must be held that there was no evidence that appellant ever
had the books or that the books sent through the mail were some of those that
had been stolen.

Per Rinfret,
Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: Before being questioned by said officers, who were
persons in authority, appellant should have been warned, and the burden was
upon the Crown to show that the proper warning was given. Though not yet
arrested, appellant was practically in custody. Physical custody was not
necessary, under the circumstances, to make inadmissible the evidence of
appellant's statements made under questioning without the proper caution having
been given; the same rule should apply as when a person has been arrested,
because the reasons that justify the rule in that case are equally applicable
when the suspect is threatened with being charged with the commission of a
crime. Principles stated in Rex v. Knight and Thayre, 20 Cox's
Cr. C. 711, at 713; Lewis v. Harris, 24 Cox's Cr. C. 66, and Rex
v. Crowe and Myerscough, 81 J.P. 288, should govern the present
case. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed, and, as there was no evidence
left to substantiate the charge, the conviction should be quashed and appellant
acquitted.

[Page 251]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba (Prendergast, C.J.M., Dennistoun, Trueman, Robson and
Richards, JJ.A.) dismissing (Dennistoun and Robson, JJ.A., dissenting, on
grounds which are set out in the judgment of Taschereau J. infra) an
appeal from the appellant's conviction by a police magistrate of having
unlawfully received eleven gasoline ration books which had theretofore been
stolen, knowing the same to have been stolen.

The reasons for judgment in this Court now
reported deal mainly with the question as to admissibility in evidence of
statements made by appellant in certain interviews between police officers and
him. These interviews took place on August 7, 1942. The charge was laid on
September 16, 1942.

A. R. Micay for the appellant.

E. J. Thomas for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.
was delivered by

Kerwin J.—The appellant was tried before the Police Magistrate at Winnipeg
on a charge of having ""unlawfully received eleven gasoline ration books of
the value of $5.50, the property of His Majesty the King, which had theretofore
been stolen, he then well knowing the same to have been stolen."" He was
found guilty mainly on the strength of the evidence of Inspector Anthony of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police as to what occurred in an interview between
Anthony and the appellant.

No reference is made in the magistrate's reasons
for conviction to what had previously transpired when two other officers had
visited the appellant at the latter's house. I find it impossible on the
transcript of the evidence to decide whether that part of the evidence of one
of these officers, Hannah:—""I then talked to him and tried to get him to
return them to me voluntary, saying I thought it would be better for him to do
so"", refers to a time before or after, when, according to the other
officer, Lyssey, the appellant said in the presence of the two
officers:—""What if I have them; it is his word against mine: he brought
them here anyway"",—the ""his"" and ""he"" referring to one

[Page 252]

Nagurski who had been convicted of stealing
ration books but who declined, in the witness box, to identify the appellant as
the person to whom he had sold them. If Hannah's statement to the appellant,
which included the phrase, ""I thought it would be better for him to do
so"", occurred prior to the appellant's statement which included the
sentence, ""he brought them here anyway"", it would clearly vitiate the
latter as having been made under fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. Ibrahim v. The King[1], Sankey v. The
King[2]. If the magistrate had
found that Hannah's statement had been made later and that what otherwise
transpired between the appellant and the two officers had not brought the case
within the rule, I would not be disposed to interfere, as Gach had not been
arrested.

As I have already mentioned, the magistrate
proceeded mainly on the evidence of Anthony, and this evidence was clearly
inadmissible as it referred to a conversation that occurred after the appellant
had been told by Hannah ""it would be better for him to do so"". The
appeal should therefore be allowed, but in order to decide what order should be
made, I have examined all the evidence in detail. It has already been noted
that Nagurski did not identify the appellant. No ration books were found on the
latter or in his house. Eight ration books were returned through the mail, each
in a separate envelope. In the unsatisfactory state of the record, I have come
to the conclusion that there was no evidence that the appellant ever had the
books or that the books sent through the mail were some of those that had been
stolen.

I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.

The judgment of Rinfret, Hudson and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—On the 16th of September, 1942, in the City of Winnipeg, the
appellant was charged of having ""unlawfully received eleven gasoline
ration books of the value of $5.50, the property of His Majesty the King, which
had theretofore been stolen, he then well knowing the same to have been
stolen.""

[Page 253]

The appellant was convicted, sentenced to three
months' imprisonment, and the Manitoba Court of Appeal confirmed this
conviction, Mr. Justice Dennistoun and Mr. Justice Robson dissenting.

The dissenting Judges based their dissent on
five grounds:—

1. There was no sufficient evidence that
Gach was the man with whom Nagurski dealt for the purchase of the gasoline
ration books.

2. Nagurski's testimony needed both support
and corroboration—both of which were lacking.

3. The statements of accused to the police
officers were procured

(1) without previous warning or caution,
and

(2) by inducement that it would be better
for accused, etc.

Wherefore, admission of this evidence was
improper.

4. That the statements alleged by accused
to the police were not admissions of crime.

5. That there was no evidence that accused
had the books and the police testimony as to receipt of certain books through
the post was improperly admitted.

The evidence at the trial was very short. The
first witness, one Edward Nagurski, admitted having stolen ration books, which
he sold for $17.00. When asked in cross-examination if he could identify the
accused, his answer was: ""No, I am not certain.""

All the other witnesses, Nicholas Lyssey,
Clarence Hannah, Melville Anthony, are members of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. Lyssey and Hannah, bearers of a search warrant, called at the residence
of the appellant. They informed him that Nagurski had made a statement to the
effect that he had sold to the appellant eleven gas ration coupon books for
$17.00, and proceeded to question him. They told him that he ""could be
prosecuted"", and that ""in any event it would be better for him to
hand them over."" At the end of the conversation they informed the accused
""that he was to accompany them to the barracks"" to talk to Inspector
Anthony.

Inspector Anthony repeated to the appellant
""that as far as he was concerned he might in any event be charged""
and ""that he would be charged in all probability.""

In answer to these various questions, the
appellant said: ""What if I have them, it is his word against mine; he brought them here anyway"". He added: ""I have not any
gasoline ration books, what is this all about?"" ""My

[Page 254]

mother just died last night, and I do not know
where I am at."" ""You have advised me that I would be charged, so if I
returned them, I would not have any chance.""

Anthony also says in his evidence:—

I agreed he was perfectly right, and he
asked how the books could be returned, and I told him it was up to himself. If
he had them that he could hand them into me, or I said there is a good postal
service in Winnipeg, and he wanted to go. It was his mother's funeral, and I
let him go. On the eighth of August I received from the Post Office eight
ration books enclosed in airmail envelopes, addressed R C M P Winnipeg.

I think that this appeal should be allowed.

Before being questioned by these officers who
were persons in authority, the appellant should have been warned. It is true,
that at that time he was not arrested yet, but he was practically in custody.

As Darling, J. says in Booth and Jones[3]:—

I say ""practically"" because
physical custody is not necessary to make-such evidence inadmissible.

Moreover, the presence of these officers with a
search warrant, in the house of the appellant, his transfer to the barracks to
be questioned by Inspector Anthony, the suggestion that it would be
""better for him to talk and give the coupons back"" created an
atmosphere prejudicial to the appellant.

There is no doubt that when a person has been
arrested, all confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of
questioning, are inadmissible in evidence, unless proper caution has been
given. This rule which is found in Canadian and British Law is based on the
sound principle that confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a
hope of advantage which an accused may expect from a person in authority.

I believe that under the circumstances of this
case, the same rule must apply—for the reasons that justify it in the case of
an accused person, are equally applicable when the suspect is threatened of
being charged with the commission of a crime.

The appellant should not have been questioned
unless properly warned, and the burden was upon the Crown to show that such
warning has been given. The Queen v. Thompson[4].

[Page 255]

In Rex v. Knight and Thayre[5], Channell, J. says:—

It is, I think, clear that a police
officer, or any one whose duty it is to inquire into alleged offences, as this
witness here, may question persons likely to foe able to give him. information,
and that, whether he suspects them or not, provided that he has not already
made up his mind to take them into custody. When he has taken any one into
custody, and also before doing so when he has already decided to make the
charge, he ought not to question the prisoner. A magistrate or judge cannot do
it, and a police officer certainly has no more right to do so.

In Lewis v. Harris[6], it was held by the
King's Bench Division:—

A statement made by a person to a constable
in answer to an inquiry by the constable is admissible in evidence on
subsequent criminal proceedings against such person although no caution was
given by the constable, provided that the person was not at the time in custody
on the charge, that the constable on making the inquiry had not formed the
intention of instituting proceedings whatever the answer might be, and
that no inducement was held out or threat made to induce such person to make
the statement.

And in Rex v. Crowe and Myerscough in
the Central Criminal court[7], it was
held by Sankey, J.:—

If a police officer has determined to
effect an arrest, or if the person is in custody, then he should ask no
questions which will in any way tend to prove the guilt of such person from his
own mouth.

I believe that these principles should govern
this case, and I therefore come to the conclusion that the evidence of the
three officers was improperly admitted.

The appeal should, therefore, be allowed, and,
as there is no evidence left to substantiate the charge, the conviction should
be quashed and the accused acquitted.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Perjury—Declaration
made by vendor pursuant to Bulk Sales Act—Statement proved to be false—Whether
offence is perjury under section 172 Cr. C.—Substitution of lesser offences
under sections 175 and 176 Cr. C—Criminal Code , sections 170 , 171 , 172 , 173 ,
174 , 175 , 176 , 951 (1) , 1016 (2) —Bulks Sales Act, R.S.B.C. 1986, c. 29—British
Columbia Evidence Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 90.

The Bulk Sales Act of British Columbia provides that
the vendor of any stock in bulk shall give to the purchaser a list of his
creditors with the amount of all accounts owing by him in connection with his
business. Such statement had to be verified by the solemn statutory declaration
of the vendor. The respondent sold his cafe business and gave the required
statement to the purchaser, declaring that he did not owe any debts. The
declaration proved to be false and he was convicted on a charge of perjury. The
conviction was quashed by a majority of the appellate court.

Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (58 B.C.R.
51), Kerwin and Hudson JJ. dissenting, that the respondent did not give a false
statement under oath while called as a witness in a judicial proceeding (s. 170 
Cr. C.) nor did he give a false oath in a judicial proceeding in the manner
contemplated by section 172 Cr. C., and therefore, cannot be charged of having
committed the crime of perjury under these sections.

Per Rinfret and Taschereau JJ.:—Section 170  Cr. C.,
defining perjury, enacts that it may be committed only ""by a witness
in a judicial proceeding""; and section 172 Cr. C. provides that
""every one is guilty of perjury who ***"". So, any violation of this
last section amounts to perjury: it must necessarily be perjury as
defined in section 170  Cr. C. and, therefore, in a judicial proceeding.

Per Davis J.:—The concluding words of section 176 Cr.
C: ""makes a statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a
judicial proceeding"" show that section 172 Cr. C. is limited to false
statements made on oath in a judicial proceeding.

Per Kerwin J. dissenting:—Section 172 Cr. C. contains
no reference to section 170  Cr. C. nor does it state that the enumerated acts
must be done by a witness or in a judicial proceeding. By section 172 Cr. C.,
Parliament has enacted that every one who does the things specified is guilty
of a crime (perjury). In view of the plain language of that section, a person
falling within its terms is just as guilty of what Parliament has chosen to
call perjury as one who falls within the ambit of section 170  Cr. C—The
respondent's solemn statutory declaration contains the statement that such
declaration was of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by
virtue of the Canada Evidence Act . The declaration having been proven to
be false. the respondent was guilty of perjury under section 172  Cr. C.

[Page 104]

Per Hudson J. dissenting:—The taking of the statutory
declaration falsely by the respondent, is perjury within the meaning of section
172 Cr. C.

As to the question whether or not a conviction could or should
have been made for a lesser offence under sections 175 and 176 Cr. C., pursuant
to sections 951 (1)  and 1016 (2)  Cr. C.,

Held that the respondent could not have been found
guilty under 176 Cr. C.

Per Rinfret and Taschereau JJ.:—There is no evidence
that the commissioner, before whom the respondent gave the statutory
declaration, was an officer authorized by law to receive a statement or a
declaration of the particular character mentioned in section 176 Cr. C.—No
opinion expressed as to whether that section contains the elements of a lesser
offence.

Per Davis J.:—Perjury, as defined in the Criminal Code 
(s. 170 ) does not ""include"" the commission of the offence defined in
section 176  Cr. C.; and perjury was the only offence charged in this case.

Per Kerwin J.:—The offence dealt with in section 176
Cr. C. is not a lesser offence but a different one, as the declaration
mentioned therein simpliciter is not the same as the statutory declaration
referred to in section 172 Cr. C.

Held, also, that it is not open to this Court to decide
the question whether the respondent may have been found guilty of a lesser
offence under section 175 Cr. C, as there was no dissenting opinion on that
point in the appellate court.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General
for British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], which
(McDonald C.J.B.C. and O'Halloran J.A. dissenting in part, but on different
grounds) quashed the conviction of the respondent for perjury.

R. L. Maitland K.C. for
the appellant.

John A. Sutherland for the
respondent.

The judgment of Rinfret and
Taschereau JJ. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU J.—The Bulk Sales
Act of British Columbia provides that the vendor of any stock in bulk shall
give to the purchaser a list of his creditors, with the amount of the
indebtedness or liability due, owing, or accruing due or to become due. This
statement which has to be verified by the statutory declaration of the vendor,
may be in the form set forth in schedule A of the Act, or to the like effect.

[Page 105]

The respondent Charles T. Orford
who was the owner of a café in British
 Columbia sold his business in August,
1941, and in compliance with the law, gave the required statement to the
purchaser Mrs. Myra E. Ticehurst. He stated that all the accounts owing by him
in connection with his business were paid, whereas in fact, he owed over
$2,500. A charge was laid against him for perjury and he was convicted and
sentenced to the time spent in gaol and to pay a fine of $500.

The Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction on the ground that the accused could not be convicted of perjury,
the Chief Justice of British Columbia and O'Halloran J.A. dissenting on questions of law.
The Chief Justice thought that the taking of a statutory declaration falsely is
perjury within the meaning of section 172  of the Criminal Code , and that in any
event, perjury contrary to section 172  of the Criminal Code  and making a false
oath contrary to section 176  of the Criminal Code , are cognate offences, and
that a conviction ought to be entered against Orford for taking a false oath.

Mr. Justice O'Halloran reached
the conclusion that the accused should have been found guilty of the lesser
offence of making a false declaration under section 176  Cr. C.

The Attorney General for British Columbia now appeals to this Court.

The respondent at the outset of
the argument raised the question of jurisdiction of this Court, and cited the
case of The King v. Wilmot[2].
The authority of this Court to hear criminal appeals coming from the Crown is
founded on section 1023, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code . Such an appeal
lies, when any court of appeal sets aside a conviction, or dismisses an appeal
against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, on any question of law on which
there has been dissent in the court of appeal.

In the present case, the Court of
Appeal has set aside the conviction of the respondent, and there have
undoubtedly been dissents on questions of law in the court below. I have no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that this court has jurisdiction to hear
this appeal, and that the Wilmot case [3]
has no application. In that case, the accused was charged with manslaughter but
found

[Page 106]

guilty of driving in a manner
dangerous to the public under section 285(6)  of the Criminal Code . The court
came to the conclusion that he had not been acquitted, and that therefore it
was not open to the Attorney General to appeal under section 1023(2)  Cr. C. We
are confronted with an entirely different matter, because the accused has been
acquitted by the Court of Appeal.

The first submission of the Crown
is that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the offence in question did
not constitute perjury under section 172  of the Criminal Code . With deference,
I do not agree with this contention and I am of opinion that the majority of
the Court of Appeal was right.

At common law, in order to amount
to perjury, the offence had to be committed in a judicial proceeding. False
swearing was a different offence. In Canada, after Confederation, an Act respecting perjury was
introduced in Parliament in 1869 (ch. 23, 32-33 Victoria) and it is found in a
modified form in the Revised Statutes of 1886, ch. 154. The reading of this Act
will show that it was the clear intention of Parliament to do away with the existing
law, for the word ""perjury"" in the new Act did not apply only to a
witness giving evidence under oath in a judicial proceeding, but to any one,
who having taken any oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit, in any case
in which by any Act or law in force in Canada, or in any province in Canada, it
is required or authorized that facts, matters or things be verified or
otherwise assured or ascertained. The wide extension given to the word perjury
was a complete departure from the law of England, where the Star Chamber, in 1613, declared that
perjury by a witness only was punishable at common law. Kenny in his
""Outlines of Criminal Law"", 4th ed., says at page 295:—

The common law offence of
perjury, thus created, consists in the fact that a witness, to whom an oath has
been duly administered in a judicial proceeding, gives, upon some point
material to that proceeding, testimony which he does not believe to be true. It
will thus be seen that false oaths do not always involve a perjury.

The Act of 1869 remained the law
of the land until 1893, when our Criminal Code  based on the English Draft

[Page 107]

Code was enacted. We now find
section 170  Cr. C. which defines perjury as follows:—

Perjury is an assertion as
to a matter of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge, made by a witness in a
judicial proceeding as part of his evidence, upon oath or affirmation, whether
such evidence is given in open court, or by affidavit or otherwise, and whether
such evidence is material or not, such assertion being known to such witness to
be false, and being intended by him to mislead the court, jury or person
holding the proceeding.

It is for all practical purposes
a copy of the English Draft Code, except that, in Canada, it is
not necessary that the evidence given be material. But the main feature of this
section is that perjury may be committed, only by a witness in a
judicial proceeding, whether the witness gives his evidence orally, or by
affidavit or otherwise. This is obviously a return to the former notions of
perjury and a limitation of its definition to a much narrower field.

Our section 171 Cr. C, which is
also found in the Draft Code, defines what is a judicial proceeding and it
states that every proceeding is judicial which is held not only under the
authority of a Court of Justice, but also before a grand jury, or before the
Senate or House of Commons or a committee of either House, or similar bodies.

The Criminal Code  deals also with
false oaths which would amount to perjury if made in judicial proceedings.
Section 175  Cr. C, different from 122 of the Draft Code only in its
phraseology, reads as follows:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, being required
or authorized by law to make any statement on oath, affirmation or solemn
declaration, thereupon makes a statement which would amount to perjury if made
in a judicial proceeding.

This section covers the case of a
false oath given in a non-judicial proceeding. It is not called perjury, but is
merely described as being an indictable offence.

Then comes section 176  Cr. C.
drafted as follows:—

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any occasion
on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration before any
officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or before any
notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a statement which
would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial proceeding.

[Page 108]

It is significant that as in the
Draft Code the legislator uses the words ""any statement or
declaration"". We do not find as in section 175 Cr. C. ""statement on oath
or solemn declaration"". It was not sure if the giving of a false
statement or declaration not on oath to a person authorized by law to permit it
to be made before him, was a common law misdemeanour, but in their report the
English Commissioners said:—

False statements not on oath
to which faith is given are not perjury, etc.

But they felt that it should be
made indictable and proposed the enactment of section 123 which we have adopted
and embodied in our Code. It is now section 176  Cr. C. It cannot be said that
any untrue statement or false declaration is an offence under this section. But
when the false statement is given to a person authorized by law to require it,
it is an offence as it would be for instance in the case of an authorized
custom or excise officer to whom a false statement is given.

It can now be seen that the law
deals with three different offences: The crime of perjury, always committed by
a witness in a judicial proceeding; the indictable offence of giving a false
oath in a non-judicial matter; and the last, the indictable offence of giving a
false statement, not under oath, to a person authorized by law to receive it.
For those three offences the punishment is different. The gravest of all is
obviously perjury, because made in a judicial proceeding, and which renders the
offender liable to 14 years' imprisonment. The second, less serious because
extra-judicial, provides for a penalty of seven years; and the third one of a
minor character, where the penalty is only two years.

But the Criminal Code  contains
another section, which is section 172  and which is not in the English Draft
Code. It is as follows:—

Every one is guilty of
perjury who,

Having taken or made any
oath, affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act or law in
force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or permitted that
facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or ascertained by or
upon the oath,

[Page 109]

affirmation, declaration or
affidavit of any person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation,
declaration or affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to
any such fact, matter or thing; or 

Knowingly, wilfully and
corruptly, upon oath, affirmation or solemn declaration, affirms, declares or
deposes to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or
ascertaining any such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or
knowingly, wilfully and corruptly takes, makes, signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit as to any such fact, matter or thing, if
such statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration is untrue in whole or in
part.

The appellant contends that the
offence committed by the accused is covered by paragraph 2 of this section, a
false oath being in a non-judicial matter. I do not think that section 172  Cr.
C. can be interpreted in the manner suggested by the appellant.

Any violation of this section
amounts to perjury. ""Every one is guilty of perjury who""
etc. says section 172  Cr. C. It must necessarily be perjury as defined in
section 170  Cr. C. and therefore in a judicial proceeding, otherwise, we would
have to reach the illogical conclusion that 172 and 175 Cr. C. both cover extra-judicial
oaths, although the punishment for violating 172 Cr. C. is 14 years, and 7
years for 175 Cr. C.

The crimes described in sections
175  and 176  Cr. C. are not qualified as ""perjury"" but it is said in
both sections, that they would amount to perjury ""if made in a judicial
proceeding"", and these last words are omitted from 172 Cr. C, obviously
because they are unnecessary. The intention of the legislator in enacting
section 172  Cr. C. was not to repeat what was already enacted in section 175
Cr. C. concerning extra-judicial oaths, but to declare that it would be a crime
amounting to perjury, for any person other than a witness (whose case is
covered by section 170  Cr. C.), to give a false statement under oath, in a
judicial proceeding. And it is very frequent that affidavits have to be given
in judicial proceedings by persons who are not witnesses, as for instance
affidavits by plaintiffs in civil actions, before the writ of summons may be
issued.

This is, to my mind, the case
which the legislator had in mind when he enacted section 172  Cr. C, and which
otherwise would not amount to a crime under the Criminal Code . Indeed, it would
not be an offence under 170 Cr. C. because the false oath would not have been
given

[Page 110]

by a witness, and it cannot be
said that it would be a violation of section 175 Cr. C. because the oath would
be given in a judicial proceeding.

In the present case, the
respondent did not give a false statement under oath while called as a witness
in a judicial proceeding, nor did he give a false oath in a judicial proceeding
in the manner contemplated by section 172  Cr. C, and therefore, he cannot be
charged of having committed the crime of perjury.

Did the respondent commit a
lesser offence, and should he have been found guilty under sections 175  or 176 
Cr. C? It seems useless to examine the question as to whether section 175 Cr.
C. could apply, because there is no dissenting judgment on this point in the Court
of Appeal, and our jurisdiction being limited to questions of law on which
there has been a dissent, it is not open to us to deal with the matter. The
contention that section 176  Cr. C. applies is found in both dissenting
opinions, and it is based on section 951  of the Criminal Code  which says:—

Every count shall be deemed
divisible; and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the
enactment creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the
commission of any other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any
offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not
proved; or he may be convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

It is most important to note in
this section the words ""may be convicted of any offence so included, which
is proved"".

It has been proved that on the
11th of August, 1941, the respondent gave a statutory declaration under oath
before John P. Berry, a commissioner for taking affidavits within British Columbia. But in order to find the respondent guilty under section 176  Cr. C, it
would be necessary that there should be some evidence to show that John P.
Berry is an officer authorized by law to receive a statement or declaration
under 176 Cr. C. John P. Berry may be a person authorized to receive a
statement under oath, but there is nothing to show that he is an officer
authorized by a statute to receive a statement or a declaration of the
particular character mentioned in section 176  Cr. C. The falsity of the contents
of such 

[Page 111]

a declaration or statement
amounts to a crime only when the statement or declaration is made before such
officers which are empowered, in view of the functions they occupy, to receive
them. It has not been established that Berry was clothed with such authority.

This reason is, I think,
sufficient to dispose of this last point raised by the appellant, and in view
of my conclusion, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether
section 176  Cr. C. contains the elements of a lesser offence.

The appeal should be dismissed.

DAVIS J.—The respondent was charged and convicted of
perjury. On appeal the Court of Appeal for British Columbia set aside the
conviction, the Chief Justice and O'Halloran J., dissenting. The Attorney
General of British Columbia appealed to this court.

The charge was perjury but it was
not stated to have been laid under any particular section of the Criminal Code .
The majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal agreed that the facts did not
bring the case within the definition of perjury in the Criminal Code ; the
statutory declaration made by the respondent under sec. 5 of the Bulk Sales
Act of British Columbia not being made in a judicial proceeding. See secs.
170, 171 and 172 of the Criminal Code . By sec. 174 Cr. C. everyone is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to 14 years' imprisonment who commits perjury
or subornation of perjury; if the crime is committed in order to procure the
conviction of a person for any crime punishable by death, or imprisonment for
seven years or more, the punishment may be imprisonment for life.

The two dissenting judges in the
Court of Appeal thought that a conviction could have been made under sec. 176 
Cr. C.:

176. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any
occasion on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration
before any officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or
before any notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a
statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial
proceeding.

The concluding words,

makes a statement which
would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial proceeding,

[Page 112]

show, I think, that sec. 172  Cr.
C. is limited to false statements made on oath in a judicial proceeding. I
think as a matter of proper construction one is not justified in reading two
different sections of the Criminal Code  (secs. 172 and 176) as if they covered
the same thing, but that the construction should be approached in an endeavour
to give to each of the sections its own independent meaning. Here we have secs.
170, 171, 172 and 173 Cr. C. defining perjury, followed in 174 Cr. C. with a
very heavy penalty. Subsequently sec. 176 Cr. C. deals with certain false
statements or declarations ""which would amount to perjury if made on oath
in a judicial proceeding,"" and the penalty is two years' imprisonment. Mr.
Justice Taschereau has set out in his judgment all the relevant sections of the
Code and has very carefully considered their origin and scope.

In considering the question
whether or not a conviction could and should have been made under sec. 176 Cr.
C. (sec. 175 Cr. C. may have had some application but is not relied on in the
dissents), much confusion of thought is likely to be avoided if we keep to the
exact words of the statute instead of adopting other words such as ""lesser
offences"" and ""cognate offences"" which have not infrequently
been used in many of the decisions. Under sec. 951 Cr. C. the offence charged
must ""include"" the commission of the ""other offence."" It is
contended that by virtue of sec. 951 Cr. C. the Court of Appeal could and
should have substituted a conviction under sec. 176 Cr. C. for making a false declaration
under the Bulk Sales Act of British
 Columbia. But in my opinion perjury as
defined in the statute does not ""include"" the commission of the
offence defined in sec. 176  Cr. C. Nor could sec. 1016 (2)  Cr. C. empower the
Court of Appeal on the facts of this case to substitute a conviction under sec.
176  Cr. C. Sec. 1016 (2)  Cr. C. applies only where an appellant has been
convicted of an offence and the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or
magistrate, could ""on the indictment"" have found him guilty of some
other offence. Perjury was here the only offence charged. See Rex v. Leroux
[4].

I should dismiss the appeal.

[Page 113]

KERWIN J. (dissenting).—This is
an appeal by the Attorney General for British Columbia from an order of the
Court of Appeal for that province quashing the conviction for perjury of the
respondent Charles T. Orford. The appeal is based upon the dissents on
questions of law of the Chief Justice of British Columbia and Mr. Justice
O'Halloran.

The conviction was made after the
trial of the respondent on a charge:—

1. For that he, the said
Charles T. Orford, at the said City of Vancouver, on the 11th day of August,
A.D. 1941, being permitted by the Canada Evidence Act  to verify certain
facts relating to his financial obligations by solemn declaration, unlawfully
did commit perjury by knowingly, wilfully and corruptly by solemn declaration,
declaring that he did not owe any debts, in respect of Good Eats Cafe and
Station View Apartments such declaration being false, contrary to the form of
the Statute in such case made and provided.

Orford had carried on businesses
under the name of ""Good Eats Café” and ""Station View Apartments""
and on August 11th, 1941, contracted to sell his stock of goods and chattels
in bulk. The Bulk Sales Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter
29, provides that in such circumstances it shall be the duty of the vendor to
furnish to the purchaser a written statement verified by statutory declaration,
which statement shall contain the names and addresses of all his creditors,
together with the amount of the indebtedness, and that such statement and
declaration may be in the form set forth in schedule A. This form concludes

and I make this solemn
declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and knowing that it
is of the same force and effect as if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada
Evidence Act .

Orford made a statement and
statutory declaration substantially in the form prescribed but the declaration
was false in that Orford did not disclose all his creditors and the charge for
perjury followed. The majority of the Court of Appeal decided that Orford was
not guilty of perjury or of any lesser offence within the meaning of section
951  of the Criminal Code  or of ""any other offence"" within the meaning
of subsection 2  of section 1016  Cr. C, and that the conviction should be
quashed.

The determination of this appeal
depends upon a consideration of several sections of the Criminal Code . Section
170  Cr. C. defines ""perjury"" and section 171  Cr. C. 

[Page 114]

defines ""witness"" and
""judicial proceeding"" as those expressions are used in section 170 
Cr. C. Then comes the section principally relied on by the appellant, section
172  Cr. C, which reads as follows:—

172. Every one is guilty of
perjury who,

(a) having taken or
made any oath, affirmation, solemn declaration or affidavit where, by any Act
or law in force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or
permitted that facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or
ascertained by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any
person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or
affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact,
matter or thing; or

(b) knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly, upon oath, affirmation or solemn declaration, affirms,
declares or deposes to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or
ascertaining any such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or
knowingly, wilfully, and corruptly takes, makes, signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit as to any such fact, matter or thing, if
such statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration is untrue in whole or in
part.

Section 174 Cr. C. enacts that
every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years'
imprisonment who commits perjury, with provision for an increased penalty in
certain circumstances. Sections 175 and 176 Cr. C. are as follows:—

175. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to seven years imprisonment who, being
required or authorized by law to make any statement on oath, affirmation or
solemn declaration, thereupon makes a statement which would amount to perjury
if made in a judicial proceeding.

176. Every one is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who, upon any
occasion on which he is permitted by law to make any statement or declaration
before any officer authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, or
before any notary public to be certified by him as such notary, makes a
statement which would amount to perjury if made on oath in a judicial
proceeding.

I find it impossible to say that
Orford's conviction for perjury on the charge as laid against him is bad
because what he did was not done in a judicial proceeding. I agree with Chief
Justice Graham of Nova Scotia when he stated in Rex v. Morrison [5]
that sections 172  and 175  Cr. C. overlap and probably mean the same thing. As
he points out, section 172  Cr. C. is taken from R.S.C. 1886, chapter 154, while
section 175 Cr. C. is taken from the English Draft Code. In Rex v. Rutherford
[6]
Mr. Justice McKay of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal,

[Page 115]

quotes the first of these
statements with approval and his judgment was concurred in by the present Chief
Justice of Saskatchewan.

While sections 172 and 175 Cr. C.
overlap, Parliament has seen fit to insert each in the Criminal Code  and I
cannot overlook the words of section 172  Cr. C.: ""Every one is guilty of
perjury who, etc."", and treat them as if they were not there. Section 172 
Cr. C. contains no reference to section 170  Cr. C. nor does it state that the
enumerated acts must be done by a witness or in a judicial proceeding. By
section 172 Cr. C, Parliament has enacted that every one who does the things
specified is just as guilty of a crime (perjury) as one who comes within the
provisions of section 170  Cr. C. Upon conviction, each becomes liable to a
penalty in accordance with section 174  Cr. C. whether or not his actions be
those of a witness or in a judicial proceeding. In view of what, with respect,
is to me the plain language of section 172  Cr. C, a person falling within its
terms is just as guilty of what Parliament has chosen to call perjury as one
who falls within the ambit of section 170  Cr. C. No doubt, in view of the
overlapping of sections 172  and 175  Cr. C, the presiding judge would consider
the gravity of a particular offence in imposing sentence.

The solemn declaration taken by
the respondent was required by the British Columbia Bulk Sales Act.
Section 63 of the British Columbia Evidence Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter
90, provides that any declaration made in the form in the schedule to that Act
shall be as valid and effectual as if expressed to be made by virtue of that
Act, notwithstanding that the same is expressed to be made by virtue of the Canada
Evidence Act . The conclusion in the form in the schedule is practically the
same as the conclusion in the form attached as schedule A to the Bulk Sales
Act. In the present case Orford's statutory declaration was taken before
one who testified that he was a commissioner for taking affidavits in the
province and it states that the declaration was of the same force and effect as
if made under oath and by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act . In one
sense, therefore, it might be said that Orford was

""permitted by the Canada
Evidence Act  to verify certain facts relating to his financial
obligations""

[Page 116]

by solemn declaration, but, even
if that be not so, the words in quotation marks may be treated as surplusage,
and the charge as drawn is sufficient.

If the conviction were not
sustainable under section 172 Cr. C, Orford could not legally have been
convicted under section 951  of the Criminal Code  as for an offence under
section 176  Cr. C, nor could the Court of Appeal proceed under subsection 2  of
section 1016  Cr. C. The offence dealt with in section 176  Cr. C. is not a
lesser offence but a different one, as the declaration mentioned therein
simpliciter is not the same as the statutory declaration referred to in section
172  Cr. C. Counsel for the appellant referred to section 175  Cr. C. but we have
no jurisdiction to consider the applicability of that section as no dissent in
the Court of Appeal was based upon the point.

The appeal should be allowed and
the conviction restored.

HUDSON J. (dissenting).—The only
ground of dissent from the judgment of the court below to which I wish to refer
is the second, namely, that the taking of a statutory declaration falsely is
perjury within the meaning of section 172  of the Criminal Code . There are
differences of opinion in this court and in the court below on this point and,
with respect, I am of the opinion that the dissent on this point is right. As
has been pointed out by other members of the court, this section of the
Criminal Code  is of purely Canadian origin and was in force in Canada long
before the Criminal Code  was passed.

Looking at the statute, chapter
154, R.S.C. 1886, section 2 is as follows:

2. Every one who,—

(a) Having taken any
oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit in any case in which by any Act or
law in force in Canada, or in any province of Canada, it is required or
authorized that facts, matters or things be verified, or otherwise assured or
ascertained, by or upon the oath, affirmation, declaration or affidavit of any
person, wilfully and corruptly, upon such oath, affirmation, declaration or
affidavit, deposes, swears to or makes any false statement as to any such fact,
matter or thing—

(b) Knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly, upon oath or affirmation, affirms, declares or deposes
to the truth of any statement for so verifying, assuring or ascertaining any
such fact, matter or thing, or purporting so to do, or knowingly, wilfully and
corruptly takes, makes, 

[Page 117]

signs or subscribes any such
affirmation, declaration or affidavit, as to any such fact, matter or thing,—such
statement, affidavit, affirmation or declaration being untrue, in the whole or
any part thereof, or—

(c) Knowingly,
wilfully and corruptly omits from any such affidavit, affirmation, or
declaration, sworn or made under the provisions of any law, any matter which,
by the provisions of such law, is required to be stated in such affidavit,
affirmation or declaration,—

Is guilty of wilful and
corrupt perjury, and liable to be punished accordingly:

It also contains a proviso as
follows:

(2) Provided, that nothing
herein contained shall affect any case amounting to perjury at common law, or
the case of any offence in respect of which other or special provision is made
by any Act.

The language is quite plain and
it seems to me that there is no justification for reading any qualification in
the section as it thus stands.

When the Criminal Code  was
compiled this section was included in almost precisely the same language. The
existence of other sections of the Criminal Code  providing for punishment of
other offences of the same character does not seem to be a sufficient
justification for reading into section 172  Cr. C. an intention by Parliament to
attach a new meaning to the language of the old provision.

The section has been so construed
by the Court in Banc in Nova Scotia in Rex v. Morrison [7],
and again by the same court in 1924 in The United States v. Snyder
[8],
and by the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan in 1923, consisting of Justices Lamont, Mackay and
Martin, in the case of Rex v. Rutherford [9].
The matter had been decided in the same way by the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in Regina v. Skelton [10].

On the other points I agree with
the other members of the court.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Charge of offences
under The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 (Dom. c. 49)—Corroboration—Admission
in evidence of certain written statement—Substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice (Cr. Code, s. 1014 (2))—Insufficiency of explanation to jury—Appellant
convicted, while another accused, charged with him, found not guilty on
subsequent separate trial—Trial Judge expressing his personal opinion to jury
as to character of witnesses—Objection to count because of vagueness and
generality to be taken before plea (Cr. Code, s. 898).

Appellant and B. and C. were charged on an
indictment containing 16 counts: 13 for conspiracy relating to the possession,
distribution and sale of drugs; two for conspiracy relating to, respectively,
the signing of prescriptions and the signing of orders, in respect of a drug;
and one charging them with selling a drug; all within the meaning of and
contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,

[Page 99]

1929 (Dom., c.
49). C. was given a separate trial, which took place subsequent to appellant's
trial, and C. was found not guilty. Appellant, on trial before Major J. and a
jury, was convicted on all counts. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed, Robson J.A.
dissenting, [1942] 2 W.W.R. 580; [1942] 3 D.L.R. 500; and he appealed to this
Court.

Held: A new
trial should be directed because (agreeing with certain grounds of dissent in
the Court of Appeal): (1) Certain evidence referred to by the trial Judge as
corroboration could not be considered by the jury as such; it was merely
evidence of opportunity.

(2) A certain written statement obtained by
the police from one E. P. (a, person mentioned in the indictment in connection
with certain charges) was improperly admitted in evidence; s. 10  of the Canada
Evidence Act  had no application; the fact that accused's counsel had
referred to the statement in cross-examination was not sufficient to permit it
to be put in evidence; the statement was made when accused was not present,
and, while the majority of the Court of Appeal considered that there was
nothing therein that E. P. did not say in the witness box, there were matters
referred to in the statement which were clearly hearsay; it could not be
confidently stated that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred, within the meaning of s. 1014 (2) , Cr. Code. (3) While the
trial Judge's general statement to the jury of the law of conspiracy might be
unimpeachable, it was of the utmost importance in this case that the
application of the law to the facts should be explained fully to the jury,
particularly so far as the evidence relating to C.'s activities were concerned;
the counts charging conspiracy to have C. unlawfully sign prescriptions and
orders, required a much fuller explanation than was given.

In disagreeing with certain grounds of
dissent in the Court of Appeal, this Court held: (1) The fact that C., on a
separate trial as aforesaid, was found not guilty, was no reason in law that
appellant should be acquitted. (2) On the new trial, it would be for the jury
to say if the conspiracy alleged between C. and accused was proved beyond a
reasonable doubt; evidence of C.'s actions on which, together with any other
relevant evidence, the jury might so find, was admissible.

(3) The trial Judge was within his province
in expressing his personal opinion as to the character of the police witnesses,
as he made it clear throughout his charge that all questions of fact were for
the jury and that the jury was not bound by his opinion. (4) The objection
taken to a count of the indictment because of vagueness and generality, should
have been taken under s. 898, Cr. Code, before the accused pleaded.

APPEAL by Forsythe, one of the accused, from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba [1]
dismissing (Robson J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, on a trial
before Major J. and a jury, for the offences hereinafter mentioned.

The appellant and two others, Bisson and
Carson, were charged on an indictment containing 16 counts—13 for

[Page 100]

conspiracy relating to the possession,
distribution and sale of drugs; two for conspiracy relating to, respectively,
the signing of prescriptions and the signing of orders, in respect of a drug;
and one, the last count, charging them with selling a drug; all within the
meaning of and contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929 (Statutes of Canada, 1929, c. 49).

On motion on behalf of Carson, a severance of his trial from the
trial of the other accused was ordered, and the trial proceeded against the
other accused. On the trial of Carson, subsequently, he was found not guilty.

Forsythe was convicted on all counts. He
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. His appeal was dismissed, Robson J.A. dissenting on a number of
grounds (with some of which this Court agreed, in directing a new trial); he
would have allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction. Forsythe appealed to
this Court.

Wray, Schaf, Lillian Young and Elizabeth
Pitt, referred to in the reasons for judgment of this Court now reported, were
persons mentioned in the indictment in connection with charges therein.

Counts 6 and 7 of the indictment, referred to
in the reasons for judgment of this Court as requiring a much fuller
explanation than was given to the jury, were charges of conspiracy to have the
said Carson, alleged in the charges to be a veterinary surgeon within the
meaning of said Act, unlawfully sign prescriptions and unlawfully sign orders,
respectively, for the filling of which diacetylmorphine, a drug within the
meaning of said Act, was required, said drug not being required for medicinal
purposes in connection with his practice as a veterinary surgeon.

By the judgment of this Court now reported, the
appeal was allowed and a new trial directed.

H. P. Blackwood K.C. for the appellant.

A. M. Shinbane K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Kerwin J.—This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba dismissing an appeal by the accused Forsythe against his conviction on
thirteen counts of conspiracy relating to the possession, distribution and sale
of drugs, one charge or count relating to the

[Page 101]

signing of prescriptions in respect of a drug,
one charge or count relating to the signing of orders respecting a drug and one
charge or count relating to the sale of drugs, all within the meaning of and
contrary to the provisions of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act of Canada. Mr. Justice Robson dissented on twelve
separate grounds set out in the formal order of the Court of Appeal and would
not only have ordered a new trial but would have acquitted the accused. We do
not agree that Forsythe should be acquitted, but, as a new trial is being
directed, as little as possible will be said about the evidence.

The accused was indicted jointly with one Carson; a severance was granted with
respect to Carson who, on his trial subsequent to Forsythe's conviction, was
found not guilty. This circumstance is no reason in law that the appellant
should be acquitted. The trial judge was within his province in expressing his
personal opinion as to the character of the police witnesses, as he made it
clear throughout his charge that all questions of fact were for the jury and that
the latter were not bound by his opinion. On the new trial, it will be for the
jury to say if the conspiracy alleged between Carson and the accused is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Evidence of Carson's actions on which, together with
any other relevant evidence, the jury might so find, is admissible. These
remarks dispose of grounds of dissent 1 to 4 inclusive.

As to ground 5, we agree with Mr. Justice Robson
that what was referred to by the trial Judge as corroboration could not be
considered by the jury as such; that is the evidence by the stenographer in
Forsythe and Bisson's office that she saw Wray and Schaf, at different times,
in the office when apparently they had no business there, and the evidence of a
witness who had seen Lillian Young with Bisson in an auction sales room. All
this would be merely evidence of opportunity and is not corroboration. Burbury
v. Jackson[2];
The King v. Baskerville[3].
On this ground a new trial should be directed.

A new trial should also be directed because the
written statement obtained by the police from Elizabeth Pitt was improperly
admitted (ground 6 of dissent). Section 10  of the Canada Evidence Act , referred
to by the trial Judge, has no application, and counsel for the Crown

[Page 102]

before us so admitted. It was suggested that the
statement was admissible since counsel for the accused had referred to it in
cross-examination. It is true that the latter did ask Mrs. Pitt if she had
signed a statement for the police; that she admitted that she had done so but
stated there was an error in the statement. This, however, is not sufficient to
permit it to be put in evidence. The statement was made when the accused was
not present and, while the majority of the Court of Appeal considered there was
nothing in the statement that Elizabeth Pitt did not say in the witness box,
there are two or three matters referred to in the statement which are clearly
hearsay. We are unable to agree that, within the meaning of subsection 2  of
section 1014  of the Criminal Code , it can be confidently stated that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

There is nothing in grounds 7 to 9 inclusive
upon which a new trial should be directed because, subject to what is stated
presently, the case for the defence was put to the jury, and the trial Judge
did not exclude or qualify legitimate cross-examination by counsel for the
defence of Crown witnesses. As to grounds 10 to 12, it may be stated that any
objection to count 16 of the indictment because of vagueness and generality should
have been taken under section 898 of the Code before the accused
pleaded. However, while the general statement of the law of conspiracy made by
the trial Judge may be unimpeachable, it was of the utmost importance in this
case that the application of the law to the facts should be explained fully to
the jury, particularly so far as the evidence relating to Carson's activities was concerned. Counts 6
and 7 required a much fuller explanation than was given. For this third reason
a new trial is directed.

In view of the statement before us of counsel
for the respondent, no doubt the Crown authorities will consider whether it is
advisable that the accused should be tried on an indictment containing a less
number of counts, leaving it to him, if so advised, to demand particulars.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Malicious prosecution—Claim for damages for—Issue as to
absence of reasonable and probable cause for prosecution—Questions relevant to
that issue—Trial Judge's charge to jury.

[Page 82]

On a claim for damages for malicious prosecution, plaintiff
recovered judgment at trial, on the findings of a jury. The Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, [1942] 1 W.W.R. 646, set aside the judgment and
ordered a new trial, on the ground, as stated by Ford J. A., that the

[Page 83]

trial Judge's charge to the jury ""may have resulted in
confounding the real issue of the absence of reasonable and probable cause for
the prosecution with the question of the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff,
and that the learned Judge failed to keep in mind that it is the facts,
honestly and reasonably believed to exist and to be true, operating upon the
mind of the prosecutor, as distinct from the explanation made at the trial by
the plaintiff, which alone are relevant on the issue of the absence of
reasonable and probable cause.""

Plaintiff appealed to this Court, asking that the judgment at
trial be restored; and defendants cross-appealed, contending that, on the
evidence, and in view of requirements of the law as to facts to be proved, the
action should be dismissed.

Held:(1) Plaintiff's appeal should be dismissed, on the
above ground stated in the Appellate Division.

(2) Defendants' cross-appeal should be dismissed (Davis J. dubitante).

APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], which,
on appeal by the defendants from the judgment of Ewing J. at trial, on the
findings of a jury, in favour of the plaintiff on a claim for damages for
malicious prosecution, set aside the judgment at trial and ordered a new trial.
The plaintiff asked that the judgment at trial be restored. The defendants
cross-appealed, contending that, on the evidence, and in view of requirements
of the law as to facts to be proved, the action should be dismissed.

N. D. Maclean K.C. and Gerald O'Connor K.C. for
the appellant.

H. H. Parlee K.C. for the respondent companies.

H. W. Riley for the respondent individuals.

The judgment of Rinfret, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered
by

HUDSON, J.—This action was brought by the appellant
claiming damages for alleged(1) conspiracy to injure him in his business;(2)
libel and slander; and(3) malicious prosecution.

The action was tried before Mr. Justice Ewing and a jury. At the
opening of the trial, counsel for the respondents moved to have the issues
tried separately but, as the issues of fact were closely connected, severance
was refused and the trial proceeded on all three.

[Page 84]

At the conclusion of the evidence, questions were submitted by
the Judge to the jury: four questions in respect of the conspiracy issues, and
four in respect of the charge of libel and slander. These were all answered
favourably to the respondents and no longer require consideration.

Eight questions were submitted in respect of the malicious
prosecution. These were all answered favourably to the appellant, and on such
answers the learned trial Judge directed judgment to be entered for the
appellant for $16,667.90 and costs.

On appeal, this judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered on
the ground of failure by the trial Judge to properly instruct the jury on
questions of fact relating to reasonable and probable cause.

The appellant here asks that the judgment at the trial be
restored and the respondent asks that the appeal be dismissed and, by way of
cross-appeal, asks that the action be dismissed.

The actual prosecution of which the appellant complains was
initiated by a police officer under direct instructions from responsible
officials of the Attorney-General's Department in Alberta. The proceedings
throughout were conducted solely by Crown counsel.

The appellant alleges that the respondents induced such action by
false reports and fraudulent concealment of material facts and without
reasonable and probable cause procured the laying of information, and that one
of the defendants, Nash, had actually committed perjury in giving evidence at
the trial.

On the criminal charge the appellant was committed for trial but,
subsequently, before a jury was acquitted. An appeal by the Crown from this
acquittal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in Alberta, two of the Judges of
that court dissenting.

On the trial of the present action, questions were submitted to
the jury by the trial Judge and answers were given as follows:

(B) MALICIOUS PROSECUTION:

The CLERK (Reading):

1. Q. Did the defendants procure the plaintiff's prosecution
or did the Attorney General act on his own motion in prosecuting the plaintiff?
—A. The defendants procured the prosecution.

2. Q. Did the defendants place the facts fairly before the
Officers of the Attorney General?—A. No.

[Page 85]

3. Q. If the defendants did not place the facts fairly
before the Officers of the Attorney General were the Officers of the Attorney
General misled?—A. Yes.

4. Q. Did the defendants neglect to take reasonable care to
inform themselves of the true facts before procuring the prosecution?—A. No.
(Afterwards corrected to ""Yes"".)

5. Q. Did the defendants have an honest belief in the probable
guilt of the plaintiff?—A. No.

6. Q. Upon the facts in their knowledge were the defendants
justified in such belief?—A. No.

7. Q. Were the defendants, as far as the prosecution is
concerned, actuated by malice as legally defined?—A. Yes.

8. Q. If you find for the plaintiff at what sum do you
assess the plaintiff's damages for malicious prosecution?—A. Special damages,
$6,667.90; General damages, $10,000.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial
proceeded upon the ground as stated by Mr. Justice Ford:

The ground upon which the verdict and judgment cannot be
allowed to stand is that, with great respect, I think it may fairly be said
that the learned Judge's charge to the Jury may have resulted in confounding
the real issue of the absence of reasonable and probable cause for the
prosecution with the question of the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff, and
that the learned Judge failed to keep in mind that it is the facts, honestly
and reasonably believed to exist and to be true, operating upon the mind of the
prosecutor, as distinct from the explanation made at the trial by the
plaintiff, which alone are relevant on the issue of the absence of reasonable
and probable cause.

Careful perusal of the evidence and the charge of the learned
trial Judge to the jury has convinced me that the defendants are at least
entitled to a new trial on the ground thus stated by Mr. Justice Ford.

The respondents, however, go further and press strongly for a
dismissal of the action, and this raises a more difficult question.

The basis of the respondents' contention is that it appears that
three responsible officers of the Crown charged with the administration of
criminal law in the Province of Alberta were witnesses at the trial and stated
in clear and unequivocal language their justification for the prosecution of a
suspected wrongdoer. It is further submitted that the Crown officers say that
there was no pressure brought upon them to prosecute the appellant, nor were
they misled in any way by the reports made by or on behalf of the respondents.

The appellant here answers this by referring to the answers given
by the jury, that the defendants procured

[Page 86]

the plaintiff's prosecution, that they
did not place the facts clearly before the officers of the Attorney General,
that the officers of the Attorney General were misled, that the defendants
neglected to take reasonable care to inform themselves of the true facts before
procuring prosecution, that the defendants did not have an honest belief in the
probable guilt of the plaintiff and were not justified in any such belief by
the facts in their knowledge and were guided by their malice.

It is also contended that there was evidence that, in order to
induce the Attorney-General's Department to prosecute, the respondents had
furnished completely false statements.

These issues were all placed before the jury, perhaps not so
clearly as they should have been but, undoubtedly, the learned trial Judge was
of the opinion that there was evidence to justify submission of the questions.
The learned Judges in appeal were also of that opinion. Mr. Justice Ford says:

There was, in my opinion, some evidence to submit to the
Jury upon whose finding thereon the trial Judge might have found an absence of
reasonable and probable cause, and I think it is improper, in this appeal, to
dismiss the action as asked for by the appellants, there being also some
evidence to support a finding of malice.

There was also evidence upon which it could be found that
the defendants procured the prosecution of the plaintiff on the charge upon
which he was acquitted.

If the jury had understood clearly that in making their answers
they were in effect saying that they did not believe the evidence of Crown
counsel, their answers might have been different. However, these are questions
of fact and, on the state of the record, I am not disposed to interfere with
the course directed by the Court of Appeal and should, therefore, dismiss the
appeal and cross-appeal with costs.

DAVIS, J.—The only claim, amongst several in the action
out of which this appeal arises, with which we are concerned is the claim for
malicious prosecution, in respect of which judgment was given at the trial,
upon the verdict of a jury, for the appellant (plaintiff) against all the
respondents (defendants) in the sum of $16,667.90
and costs fixed at $5,000.
The Court of Appeal for Alberta set aside the judgment and directed a new
trial. Both parties appealed to this Court; the appellant seeking to

[Page 87]

have the trial judgment restored and the
respondents seeking by cross-appeal to have the action dismissed.

The action was brought against eleven defendants (seven fire
insurance companies and four individuals who were employees of a fire insurance
investigation bureau). There were two claims of conspiracy: one of an alleged
conspiracy to injure the plaintiff in his trade and business, and the other an
alleged conspiracy to procure him to be prosecuted for obtaining money by false
pretences; three claims for slander; claims for twelve separate libels; and a
claim for malicious prosecution. Some of the issues were withdrawn before
trial, others were dismissed by the Court during the trial, and others
dismissed on the jury's answers to questions submitted to them. The only claim
that remains is the claim for malicious prosecution.

The criminal charges had been that the plaintiff in this action
did, with intent to defraud by false pretences, obtain from the insurance
companies certain sums of money contrary to the provisions of the Criminal
Code . Each of the charges was laid by a Detective-Corporal of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police at Edmonton upon directions from the Department of the
Attorney General of Alberta. The fire which had destroyed the plaintiff's home
and its contents had occurred in November, 1933; the loss was adjusted and the
companies paid in February, 1934, on the basis of the adjustment; subsequently,
on investigation, the defendants or some of them desired to have the plaintiff
arrested on a charge of receiving the moneys under false pretences. The matter
was brought by them to the attention of the Attorney General's Department but
the law officers of the Crown undertook an investigation of their own into the
matter. Mr. Henwood, the Deputy Attorney General, and two counsel in the
Attorney General's Department, Mr. Frawley and Mr. McClung, all experienced law
officers who have been with the Department for many years, came to the
conclusion that the charges should be laid and they were laid on October 2nd, 1935. Counsel from the Attorney General's Department took the preliminary
inquiry and also prosecuted at the trial. When the plaintiff was acquitted at
the trial, the Attorney General appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta-
and by his law officers prosecuted the appeal before that Court. The Court of
Appeal dismissed the

[Page 88]

appeal but two of the Judges dissented
from this judgment. The Attorney General then applied to the Court of Appeal
for written reasons of judgment in order that he might consider a further
appeal in the prosecution to this Court. See [1936] 2 W.W.R. 528. It does not
appear that an appeal was brought to this Court.

The criminal proceedings were initiated and continued throughout
by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Alberta. At the trial of this action
in October, 1940, the law officers of the Crown, Mr. Henwood, Mr. Frawley and
Mr. McClung, all gave evidence and it is plain from their evidence that the
decision to prosecute and the prosecution itself lay entirely in the hands and
under the control of the Attorney General's Department and that they thought
they had had reasonable cause for their belief in the guilt of the accused and
had not been misled (or ""let down"" as the phrase is used in the
evidence) by any of the information or reports that originally had been
furnished to them by the defendants or some of them.

I find it very difficult on the evidence to accept the contention
that a jury might properly come to the conclusion that the defendants were the
prosecutors and equally difficult on the law to conclude that a right of action
for malicious prosecution lay against the defendants, but as the other members
of the Court who sat upon this appeal are not prepared to go farther than the
Court of Appeal did, which directed a new trial, I shall not dissent from that
disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal.

KERWIN, J.—In my view, the respondents are entitled to a
new trial for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Ford. As there is to be a new
trial, I refrain from discussing the evidence. The respondents are not entitled
to a dismissal of the action for malicious prosecution and on this point also I
agree with Mr. Justice Ford. The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed
with costs.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Jury trial—Practice and procedure—Option
made after expiration of delay—Consent of parties to extend delay—Right to jury
trial forfeited and cannot be revived—Rule not one of mere procedure—Conditions
prescribed for jury trial are imperative—Jurisdiction of jury extinguished
after expiration of delay—Article 442 C.C.P.

The appellant brought an action against the
respondents for damages caused to him through the death of his son, killed by
the respondent company's truck driven by the other respondent, and made option
in his statement of claim for a trial by jury. On the 12th of December, 1941,
the trial resulted in a disagreement. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for
the appellant prepared a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the
second trial, and counsel for the respondents agreed in writing to the motion.
But, on the day fixed for the trial, objection was entered by counsel for the respondents
against the hearing of the case by a jury, on the ground that the consent given
by him was not valid. The trial judge overruled the objection, and, after
verdict by a jury, awarded $3,199.60 to the appellant. The appellate court
reversed this judgment on the sole ground that the appellant had forfeited his
right to a jury trial, and the record was sent back to the Superior Court for
trial before a judge without a jury.

Held that the
appeal to this Court should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin,
Hudson and Taschereau JJ. When both parties to an action have forfeited their
right to a jury trial through the expiration of the delay prescribe by article
442 C.C.P., either of them
cannot, even with the consent of the other, revive such right, no more than
they could give a valid consent to a jury trial when the law does not grant
right to it. The obligation, imposed by that article and drawn up in imperative
terms, is more than an ordinary rule of procedure prescribing a delay, which
rule the parties would at liberty follow or extend. The right to a jury trial
is subordinate to the conditions which are intimately connected with it. The
law has not only granted a right to the litigants, but it has also conferred
jurisdiction to twelve persons to hear the case and has imposed upon them the
obligation to perform their duties, when the request has been made to the court
within the prescribed delay. Consequently, when the delay has expired, a
conditional right has been lost because the condition has not been fulfilled;
and the jurisdiction of the jury has passed away and cannot be re-established,
even with the consent of the parties.

[Page 465]

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the ; judgment of the
Superior Court, Savard J. and referring the case back to that Court for a new
trial.

The appellant, on the 9th of October, 1941,
brought an action against both respondents claiming damages for an amount of
$5,199.79 and making option for a trial by jury. On the 23rd of December, 1940,
the truck of the respondent company, driven by the respondent Coutu, had struck
and killed the appellant's son. A few days before the trial, the appellant
filed an incidental demand for seizure before judgment of the respondent company's
truck. A first trial before jury took place in December, 1941, but the jury
disagreed. Following the mistrial, it is contended by the appellant that
pourparlers of settlement had been in order within the thirty days' period
after the date of the first judgment; and both parties admitted that, on the
8th of January, 1942, a letter was written by the respondents' counsel offering
$500 in full settlement of the claim, which offer was refused on the 15th of
January, 1942. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for the appellant prepared
a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the trial; and counsel for
the respondents agreed in writing to the motion. But, on the day fixed, counsel
for the respondents objected to the trial and moved to strike the panel on the
ground that the consent given was not valid and that more than thirty days had
elapsed from the date of the first judgment to the date of the motion for a new
trial. The trial judge overruled the objection and ordered the parties to
proceed with the trial. The respondents were condemned, after verdict by a
jury, to pay to the appellant $3,199.79 for damages, and the incidental demand
respecting the seizure of the truck was also maintained. The appellate court,
without considering the other grounds of appeal, reversed that judgment,
holding that the appellant had lost his right to a jury trial by failing to
proceed within the delay prescribed by article 442 C.C.P.; consequently, the
verdict was quashed and the case was referred to the Superior Court to be heard
before a judge without jury. The appellant appealed to this Court.

[Page 466]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J.
was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal
with costs.

The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—Le fils du demandeur a été frappé par
l'automobile de la Carrière Lumber Company, conduite par un nommé Roland Coutu, qui à ce moment était dans
l'exercice de ses fonctions d'employé. Il est décédé quelques heures après
l'accident, et l'appelant a réclamé des dommages au montant de $5,199.79.

L'action a été instituée le 19 octobre 1941, et le 22 novembre de la
même année, par voie de demande incidente, le demandeur a fait saisir avant
jugement le camion de la défenderesse.

La cause a été entendue une première fois devant un
jury à Amos le 12 décembre 1941, mais par suite d'un désaccord un nouveau
procès s'instruisit le 10 mars 1942. Cette fois, le jury rendit un verdict
accordant au demandeur la somme de $3,199.60, et, par jugement en date du 12 mars, M. le juge Savard confirma ce verdict.

En cours du Banc du Roi, les défendeurs ont attaqué
ce jugement en invoquant les raisons suivantes:—

1. Absence de
responsabilité.

2. Faute contributoire du jeune Dudemaine.

3. Dommages excessifs.

4. Le demandeur avait perdu
son droit à un procès par jury lors du second procès, n'ayant pas fait les
procédures voulues dans les trente jours tel que l'exige l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile.

A l'exception de M. le juge St-Germain qui
enregistra sa dissidence après avoir examiné tous les points soulevés par les
défendeurs, la Cour du Banc du Roi ne considéra que le dernier argument, et en
vint à la conclusion que le demandeur était bien déchu de son droit au procès
par jury et que le dossier devait être retourné à la Cour Supérieure pour qu'il
en soit disposé de la manière ordinaire devant un juge. Et comme conséquence de
ce premier

[Page 467]

jugement, la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu aussi
le second appel des défendeurs se rapportant à la demande incidente, et a rendu
la même ordonnance.

C'est l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile qui doit déterminer les droits respectifs
des parties; il se lit ainsi:

442. A défaut par la
partie qui a demandé le procès par jury de procéder sur cette demande dans les
trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès ou pour un
nouveau procès, elle est de plein droit déchue de là faculté de le faire; mais
le juge peut, sur demande faite dans l'intervalle, lui accorder un délai
additionnel pour raison valable.

L'autre partie peut, dans les quinze jours
après l'expiration de ce délai, procéder au procès par jury.

A défaut de le faire dans aucun de ces cas, la
cause peut être instruite pour enquête et audition en la manière ordinaire.

L'appelant admet évidemment que son application
pour un second procès par jury était tardive, car elle n'a été faite que le 7 février 1942, quand le premier verdict avait été rendu le 12 décembre 1941. Les délais
étaient clairement expirés, mais, l'appelant invoque un consentement signé par
les parties à ce qu'il soit procédé à la formation du rôle des jurés le 11 février 1942. Mais, il est bon de noter que, malgré le consentement donné, le
procureur des défendeurs s'est objecté à la formation du rôle, parce que les
délais étaient expirés et que le consentement était invalide. C'est cette
prétention que la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenue, et elle en est venue à la
conclusion que le délai de trente jours est de rigueur, que les parties avaient
perdu leurs droits respectifs au procès par jury, et que le consentement ne
pouvait les faire revivre.

Il est certain, et la Cour du Banc du Roi admet ce
principe, que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple question de procédure, les
tribunaux doivent donner effet aux consentements donnés par les parties. Mais,
la question qui se pose ici a-t-elle le même caractère? Quand un droit
exceptionnel est donné à condition qu'il soit exercé dans un certain délai,
peut-on faire revivre par consentement ce délai expiré? Car, il est
indiscutable que dans la province de Québec, le cours normal de la procédure
est que tout procès doit s'instruire devant un juge sans jury. C'est par
exception qu'en certains cas, déterminés par le code, il y a lieu au procès par
jury. Mais, lorsque le demandeur désire exercer ce droit restreint, il doit
procéder sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause
est mûre pour le

[Page 468]

procès, et à défaut de le faire, il est déchu
de son droit. Le défendeur peut, dans les quinze jours qui suivent, faire la
même demande, mais il est lui aussi frappé de la même déchéance s'il néglige
d'exercer ce privilège. Même le juge ne peut accorder de prolongation quand les
délais sont expirés.

Cette obligation, imposée par l'article 442 du C.P.C. et rédigée dans des termes
impératifs, me semble être plus qu'une simple règle de procédure déterminant un
délai que les parties peuvent respecter ou prolonger à volonté.

Le droit au procès par jury est subordonné à des
conditions qui y sont intimement liées, et qui pour ainsi dire en font partie.
On ne peut choisir un procès par jury sans accepter toutes les obligations qui
en découlent. Le code, en décrétant en quels cas il y aura lieu à ce mode de
procès, a non seulement accordé un droit aux plaideurs, mais il a aussi conféré
une juridiction à douze hommes d'entendre ce litige, et leur a imposé
l'obligation de servir, quand la demande est faite au tribunal dans les délais
voulus.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a décidé que les deux
parties, déchues de leur droit, ne pouvaient faire revivre ce droit expiré, pas
plus qu'elles ne pourraient donner un consentement valide à un procès par jury,
quand le code ne l'accorde pas. Un droit conditionnel a été perdu, faute de la
réalisation de la condition. La juridiction est maintenant disparue; et
celle-ci ne peut être rétablie par un consentement.

Les tribunaux de la province de Québec ont toujours
interprété sévèrement cette disposition de l'article 442
C.P.C, qui détermine dans quel délai doit agir celui qui
veut conserver son droit au procès par jury. Ainsi, en 1902,
Sir Alexandre Lacoste, parlant pour la Cour du Banc du
Roi, disait dans Canadian Pacific Railway v. Foster[1],

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception et il faut strictement se conformer aux exigences de la loi pour
pouvoir en réclamer le bénéfice.

Le même principe a été réaffirmé en 1940 par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Consolidated Theatres Limited v. Nihon[2]:—

[Page 469]

La demande pour le choix et l'assignation du
jury et pour la fixation des dates doit être faite dans les trente jours de la
définition des faits. La demande pour la définition des faits doit être faite
dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès.
Faute d'observer ces délais, le demandeur perd tous ses droits au procès par
jury.

Et, plus récemment encore, dans Wise v. Boxenbaum[3]:—

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception; pour en pouvoir réclamer le bénéfice, il faut se conformer
strictement aux exigences de la loi. Il ne suffit pas d'avoir opté pour cette
forme de procès et par là d'avoir acquis le droit de s'en prévaloir; il faut
encore conserver ce droit en observant les délais prescrits. Ainsi la
définition des faits doit être demandée dans les trente jours qui
suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès; et la cause est mûre pour le
procès quand la contestation est liée, ou à l'expiration du délai dans lequel
elle devait l'être. Faute d'observer ces délais, la partie perd tous ses droits
au procès par jury.

Je ne crois pas pouvoir, malgré les inconvénients
pratiques qui peuvent en résulter, entretenir une opinion différente de celle
exprimée dans le jugement dont il y a appel, et je le confirmerais.

L'appelant a cité le précédent de Lord v. La
Reine[4]. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait de savoir si
les articles 1020 et 1209 du Code de Procédure Civile de la province
de Québec, qui limitent le temps pour présenter une inscription devant la Cour
du Banc du Roi, imposent des conditions impératives sans lesquelles la cour d'appel n'a pas juridiction, et si les parties
peuvent de consentement prolonger ces délais. La Cour en est venue à la
conclusion qu'il s'agissait d'une question de procédure, où les parties
pouvaient donner un consentement valide. Je ne crois pas, cependant, que cette
décision puisse être interprétée comme voulant dire que les parties peuvent
consentir à soumettre leur litige à un jury quand ce dernier n'a plus juridiction
pour l'entendre.

Quant à l'autre précédent de cette Cour, The Montreal Tramways v. Séguin[5], je crois qu'il n'a aucune application dans
l'espèce. Dans cette cause, on s'est demandé si les parties avaient oui ou non
droit à un procès par jury; mais la demande avait été faite dans les délais
prévus au code. Personne ne s'y était objecté, et cette Cour a décidé, en
conséquence, qu'il y avait acquiescement et chose jugée sur ce point, et qu'on
ne pouvait pas invoquer ce moyen devant un tribunal d'appel. Dans le cas
actuel, lorsque le

[Page 470]

jury a été convoqué, l'intimé s'est objecté à cette
convocation vu l'expiration des délais, et on ne peut en conséquence lui
reprocher un acquiescement ou invoquer contre lui l'autorité de la chose jugée.

Pour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d'opinion que
les deux appels de l'appelant doivent être rejetés avec dépens et vu la
conclusion à laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres moyens
soulevés par l'appelant.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Agreement or arrangement “to unduly prevent or
lessen competition”—Cr. Code, s. 498(1)(d)—What must be shown to establish
the offence—“Unduly”—Intent—Evidence—Admissibility of written opinions of
counsel given before the making of proposed agreements.

This Court dismissed appeals from the affirmance, by the Court
of Appeal for Ontario (Henderson J.A. dissenting on certain questions of law)
([1941] 3 D.L.R. 145), of appellants’ convictions on the charge, laid under s.
498(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , that they did unlawfully
conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one another, and with ten
other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly prevent or lessen
competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, banter, sale,
transportation or supply in certain named places and other places throughout
Canada, of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping containers.

Per the Chief Justice: S. 498(1) (d) is aimed at
protecting the specific public interest in free competition (Stinson-Reeb v.
The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276; Weidman v. Shragge, 46 Can. S.C.R.
1). The lessening or prevention agreed upon will be “undue” within the meaning
of the enactment if, when carried into effect, it will prejudice the public
interest in free competition to a degree that the tribunal of fact finds to be
undue, and an agreement to prevent or lessen competition to such an extent is,
accordingly, an offence under the enactment. In the present case, the aim of
the parties to the agreement was to secure effective control of the market in
Canada; and this fact affords in point of law a sufficient basis for a finding
that the agreement was one which, if carried into effect, would gravely
prejudice the public interest in free competition, and for a conviction under
s. 498(1) (d).

[Page 148]

Per Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.: If it
is shown that the accused entered into an agreement or arrangement, the effect
of which would be unduly to prevent or lessen competition, it need not also be
shown, in order to establish an offence under said enactment, that the
agreement or arrangement must have been intended by the accused to have that
effect. Mens rea is necessary, but that requirement was met when it was
shown that appellants intended to enter and did enter into the very arrangement
found to exist. As to the word “unduly” in the requirement to constitute the
offence: The public is entitled to the benefit of free competition (except in
so far as it may be interfered with by valid legislation), and any panty to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence (Stinson‑Reeb v. The King, [1929] S.C.R. 276). Once an
agreement is arrived at, whether anything be done to carry it out or not, the
matter must be looked at in each case as a question of fact to be determined by
the tribunal of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct object of the
arrangement complained of. The evidence in these cases of what was done is
merely better evidence of that object than would exist where no act in furtherance
of the common design had been committed.

Per curiam: Letters giving opinions of counsel to
appellants or some of them prior to the execution of original agreements in
question, which opinions, it was suggested, would indicate that the matter was
placed before counsel who advised that, on the information before them, it
would not be contrary to law for appellants, or some of them, to enter into the
agreements, were properly rejected as evidence at the trial, because, even if
the letters contained what was suggested, they could have no bearing upon the
point of substance to be determined.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
in so far as it affirmed (Henderson J.A. dissenting on certain questions of
law) the conviction of the appellants by Hope J. [2],
sitting without a jury, under the count of an indictment which charged that
they did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one
another, and with ten other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly
prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter,
sale, transportation or supply in certain named places, and other places
throughout Canada where the articles or commodities hereinafter mentioned are
offered for sale, of articles or commodities which may be the subject of trade
or commerce, to wit, corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping
containers, and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to the
provisions of the Criminal Code , s. 498 , subs. 1(d).

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The facts of the case have been fully discussed
in the eleborate judgments at the trial and in the Court of Appeal in those of
the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Masten and need not be restated.

The learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in the course of his
judgment, says:—

In my opinion it is established by evidence properly
admissible, that an agreement or arrangement was made among the manufacturers
who mainly supplied the marked throughout Canada for corrugated and solid
fibreboard boxes and shipping containers that they would place the control of
the marketing, the barter, sale and supply to customers of their output of
these products under the control of Container Materials Limited, a company that
they themselves, through their representatives on the board of directors,
controlled and operated, with the appellant Badden as president and secretary
and virtual manager, and that the measure and extent of that control was such
control as would be in the hands of a single purchaser, to whom alone any of
these manufacturers was at liberty to sell its products, or any part of them,
and for whom the manufacturers themselves in supplying their real customers
were mere agents selling the goods of that purchaser for it and under its
strict supervision and control. While this was not strictly a monopoly it was
to have all the effect of one so far as the public was concerned.

* * *

[Page 150]

If I am right in the conclusion I have reached as to the
real arrangement or scheme of these manufacturers, and of those who worked with
them in its execution, then I think there can be no question that it falls
within the terms of sec. 498 , s.s. 1(d). Its purpose was to extinguish
so far as these manufacturers were concerned all competition in the barter and
sale of these products in Canada just as completely as if Container Materials
Limited had a monopoly of them.

Mr. Justice Middleton, after referring to the judgments of this
Court in Weidman v. Shragge[3], and in
Stinson-Reeb v. The King[4], thus
expressed his conclusion:

Unquestionably these cases establish that the agreements
here referred to by the learned trial Judge are a violation of clause (d)
of section 498  and therefore the conviction ought to affirmed.

Mr. Justice Masten says:—

The organization at the time of its creation and during the
period from 1931 to 1939 appears to have included, with certain minor
exceptions, substantially all the Canadian manufacturers of corrugated and
solid fibre board boxes or shipping containers. The allegations of the Crown as
set forth in the particulars delivered by them are as follows:

“At the time of the incorporation of Container Materials
limited, the aforementioned corporations, together with Kitchener Paper Box
Company, were all the producers in Canada of corrugated paper boxes and with
the exception of Building Products Limited were all the manufacturers of fibre
board boxes.

“At the date of the indictment the accused manufacturing
corporations, together with Pacific Mills Limited, were the only producers of
corrugated and fibre board shipping containers in Canada, with the exception of
one other company with a small production.

“Building Products Limited, a corporation mentioned in the
indictment was, up to the year 1935, engaged in the manufacture of shipping
containers at which time it ceased to manufacture the same under circumstances
which will be referred to in greater detail hereafter.

“Pacific Mills Limited was since 1933, and now is, engaged
in the manufacture of shipping containers.”

The finding of the trial Judge is “that Container Materials
Limited represented that it controlled 100% of the industry”. I think it is
established that the organization operating through Container Materials Limited
substantially controlled throughout Canada during the period in question the
manufacture and sale of containers.

It is clear from the foregoing analysis of the organization
created in 1931 that it was an instrument possessing enormous potency, whose
first object was to improve or increase the profits of its members and
adherents by its control of the manufacture and sale throughout Canada of
containers. It is also manifest from the foregoing analysis that the supervision
and restrictions imposed by the organization necessarily lessened competition.
Whether the charter and by-laws of Container Materials Limited, coupled with
the four agreements when taken by themselves, make manifest an agreement to
lessen competition unduly need not be considered, for the organization
manifests a common agreement

[Page 151]

and certain subsequent overt acts done by the organization
in pursuance of the common agreement establish in my opinion that its objective
was to “unduly lessen competition” and hence was unlawful.

Mr. Justice Fisher agreed with the conclusion and reasons of the
Chief Justice.

I think it right to say that, after fully weighing the arguments
presented, I am in agreement with these conclusions of the learned Chief Justice
and Justices of the Court of Appeal in respect of fact as well as in respect of
law. It follows necessarily, of course, that the appellants must fail in their
contention that there was no evidence to support the conviction pronounced by
the learned trial Judge under clause (d) of section 498 .

This, however, is by no means the end of the matter, because it
was argued with great ability and force by counsel for the appellants that,
assuming the conclusions of fact of the learned trial Judge and of the majority
of the Court of Appeal to be well-founded, this is not sufficient to sustain
the conviction, since, the appellants contend, both the learned trial Judge and
the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal misconstrued and misapplied the
section of the Code upon which the indictment is based, which is in these
terms:—


 
  
  Lessen competition.
  
  
  498.(d) to unduly prevent
  or lessen competition in the 
  production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, (transportation or supply of
  any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or
  property
  
 


Two main points are raised. First, it is not sufficient, it is
argued, to establish an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in such a
manner, or to such an extent, that the tribunal considers to be undue in fact.
It is, it is argued, an essential element of the offence, which, of course,
must be proved, that the intention present in the minds of the accused persons
in entering into their agreement is to do what they conceive will have the
effect and which they intend to have the effect of unduly preventing or
lessening competition, within the meaning of the statute.

The second point arises from the contention of the appellants
that the essence of the offence is an agreement to do something injurious to the
public; that such injury to the public must appear from the evidence and must
be found as a fact in order to establish a legal basis for a conviction.

[Page 152]

These contentions were advanced in the Court of Appeal, as well
as in this Court. They constitute the most important grounds of appeal.

The enactment before us, I have no doubt, was passed for the
protection of the specific public interest in free competition. That, in
effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v. Shragge[5]
in the judgments of the learned Chief Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and
Mr. Justice Anglin, as well as by myself. This protection is afforded by
stamping with illegality agreements which, when carried into effect, prevent or
lessen competition unduly and making such agreements punishable offences; and,
as the enactment is aimed at protecting the public interest in free
competition, it is from that point of view that the question must be considered
whether or not the prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue. Speaking
broadly, the legislation is not aimed at protecting one party to the agreement
against stipulations which may be oppressive and unfair as between him and the
others; it is aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition. That
is only another way of putting what was laid down in Stinson-Reeb v. The
King[6] which,
it may be added, was intended to be in conformity with the decision in Weidman
v. Shragge[7], as
indicated in the passages quoted in the judgment.

The lessening or prevention agreed upon will, in my opinion, be
undue, within the meaning of the statute, if, when carried into effect, it will
prejudice the public interest in free competition to a degree that the tribunal
of fact finds to be undue, and an agreement to prevent or lessen competition to
such an extent is, accordingly, an offence against sec. 498  (d).

The learned trial Judge, as well as the learned Justices of the
Court of Appeal, directed their attention to the effect of the agreement from
this point of view. The learned trial Judge observed that the agreement was “to
put free competition into a straight jacket”. Mr. Justice Masten said “free
competition was stifled”. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario says that “the
purpose of the agreement was to extinguish so far as these manufacturers were
concerned all competition in the barter and sale of these products in Canada
just as completely as if Container Materials Limited had a monopoly of them”.

[Page 153]

The majority of the Court of Appeal rightly held, I think, that
the aim of the parties to this agreement was to secure effective control of the
market in Canada; it may be added that in this they were very largely
successful. But the fact that such was the agreement affords in point of law a
sufficient basis for a finding that the agreement was one which, if carried
into effect, would gravely prejudice the public interest in free competition,
and a conviction under section 498 (d).

With respect to the other points raised by the appellants, it is
sufficient to say that I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of my
brother Kerwin and I fully concur with him as regards those points.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rinfret, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau, JJ. was
delivered by

KERWIN J.—The appellants, together with Wilson Boxes Limited,
were convicted by Hope J. upon each of four counts in an indictment, count 1
being laid under clause (d) of subsection 1  of section 498  of the Criminal
Code , and counts 2, 3 and 4 under clauses (b), (a) and
(c) respectively. The convictions against all the accused on counts 2, 3
and 4 were quashed by the Court of Appeal; the conviction against Wilson Boxes
Limited under count 1 was set aside and a new trial directed; the convictions
of the appellants under count 1 were affirmed, and the sentences imposed by the
trial Judge were affirmed and imposed with respect to the conviction of each of
the appellants under that count. These appeals are from the affirmance of such
convictions and are based on questions of law on which Henderson J.A. dissented
in the Court of Appeal. Our jurisdiction is limited to those questions of law
and imposes upon this Court a task different from that which confronted the
Court of Appeal.

Subsection 1 of section 498 of the Code provides:—

Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a
penalty not exceeding four thousand dollars and not less than two hundred
dollars, or to two years’ imprisonment, or, if a corporation, is liable to a
penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and not less than one thousand
dollars, who conspires, combines, agrees or arranges with any other person, or
with any railway, steamship, steamboat or transportation company,

(a) to unduly limit the facilities for transporting,
producing, manufacturing, supplying, storing or dealing in any article or
commodity which may be a subject of trade or commerce; or

[Page 154]

(b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce in
relation to any such article or commodity; or

(c) to unduly prevent, limit, or lessen the
manufacture or production of any such article or commodity, or to unreasonably
enhance the price thereof; or

(d) to unduly prevent or lessen competition in
the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply
of any such article or commodity, or in the price of insurance upon person or
property.

By count 1 of the indictment, the accused were charged that they
did unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one
another and with ten other named companies or individuals not indicted, to
unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, manufacture, purchase,
barter, sale, transportation or supply, in certain named places and other
places throughout Canada, of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or shipping
containers.

The circumstances preceding the incorporation and organization of
Container Materials Limited and the facts in connection with the operation of
that company as affecting the appellants, are set forth in the reasons for
judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario. Having considered the record in
connection with the arguments presented on behalf of the appellants, I find
myself in agreement with the Chief Justice’s statement of facts. Any slight
inaccuracy does not in the least affect the matters to be determined by this
Court. These matters depend upon the questions of law upon which Henderson,
J.A., dissented, and counsel for the appellants have conveniently allocated
what they contend are those questions under six different headings as follows:—

Firstly:

That the learned trial judge erred in accepting the view of the
Crown that the intentions and objects of the accused were beside the question;
and

That mens rea or guilty mind is a necessary ingredient of
the crime here charged and the crime of conspiracy is particularly one which
involves mens rea.

Secondly:

The improper rejection of evidence.

Thirdly:

The accused were prejudiced in their defence by the manner in
which the Crown dealt with the documentary records of the accused; and

That the conviction and sentence both fail and that in order to
convict the accused on appeal the Appellate Court would have to substitute a
conviction by such Court and a sentence by such Court, which is beyond its
province.

Fourthly:

The improper admission of evidence.

Fifthly:

That it is not sufficient for the Crown to make out a prima
facie case and it is not sufficient that the Crown give in evidence
circumstances capable of two interpretations, one consistent with innocence and
the other with guilt; much less is the Court asked to find guilt from
circumstances at least equally consistent with innocence.

Sixthly:

There is no evidence to support any conviction; and

A conviction under section 498 , subsection (d),
cannot stand in view of an acquittal under subsection (b); and

That the accused were charged with one conspiracy only and that
the gist of the offence is conspiracy and that the various counts set forth in
the indictment were simply allegations of overt acts in pursuing the objects of
the conspiracy and therefore the conviction cannot be upheld.

I turn first to those identified as secondly, thirdly and
fourthly. I agree with what the learned Chief Justice has said as to the manner
in which the documents seized in the possession of various of the appellants
were subsequently dealt with. I approve of every word that he has said with
reference to this matter but I also agree with his statement “that a case was
made against each of the appellants without the assistance of any documents or
books the admissibility of which was properly objected to”. In the great
majority, if not all, of the cases to which our attention was called, where an
original letter was found in the possession of one of the accused a copy of
that letter was

[Page 156]

found in the possession of another, from whom the original
purported to have come. There was evidence before the Court sufficient to show
that the accused were engaged in accomplishing the same common object, and
evidence of one conspirator was therefore evidence against the other. The
distinction between entries made by a fellow conspirator, contained in various
documents actually used for carrying out the design, and a document not created
in the course of carrying it out but made by one of the conspirators after the
illegal object was completed, is shown in The Queen v. Blake[8],
referred to in Mirza Akbar v. King‑Emperor[9].
The appellants were not tried before a judge and jury but by a judge alone, who
has given his reasons for the conviction on count 1 and, even if any of the
evidence that was admitted before him falls within the second category, it is
quite apparent from those reasons that it had no effect upon the reasons or the
result. It has not been overlooked that the trial judge stated:—

It might also be noted that according to The Companies Act,
cap. 251, R.S.O. 1937, sec. 106, minute books which are required to be
kept by the company shall be prima facie evidence of all facts
purporting to be therein stated in any action or proceeding against the
corporation.

This provision of the Ontario Companies Act could, of
course, have no application to a prosecution under the Code, and the trial
Judge did not so treat it. He had already determined that the books were
otherwise admissible and merely added a reference to the Ontario statute.

The appellants complain that the opinions of counsel, rendered to
the appellants or some of them prior to the execution of the original
agreements, were wrongfully rejected. What these opinions are, we do not know,
but it is suggested that they would indicate that the matter was placed before
counsel who advised that, on the information before them, it would not be
contrary to law for the appellants, or some of them, to enter into the
agreements. In my opinion, the evidence was properly rejected because, even if
the letters contained what has been suggested, they could have no bearing upon
the point of substance to be determined. The only other bit of evidence
rejected by the trial judge that was specifically referred to is a letter
which, according to a statement of counsel appearing in the record, was
addressed, by Wilson Boxes

[Page 157]

Limited, to Messrs. Hardy and Badden and dated January 27th,
1939. This is the letter referred to by Chief Justice Robertson and because of
its non-admission a new trial was directed so far as the conviction of Wilson
Boxes Limited on count 1 was concerned. It is pointed out that the Chief
Justice was in error in stating that this letter was tendered in evidence by
counsel for Wilson Boxes Limited, and apparently this is so. Wilson Boxes Limited
was not represented at the trial. It was counsel for Superior Box Company,
Limited, who tendered the letter in evidence. No doubt the confusion arose
because the same counsel appeared before the Court of Appeal not only for
Superior Box Company, Limited, but also for Wilson Boxes Limited. We are not
concerned with the position of the latter company but it was argued that this
letter should have been admitted in favour of Superior Box Limited. I am unable
to see how a letter from Wilson Boxes Limited to Hardy and Badden could be
evidence on behalf of Superior Box Limited.

Having gone over the record carefully to see what transpired at
the trial with reference to the seized bundles, I am satisfied that the
appellants were not prejudiced in their defence by the manner in which the
Crown dealt with the documentary evidence of the accused. Every facility was
offered by Crown counsel and was refused by counsel for the appellants, or at
least by some.

The second, third and fourth points argued by the appellants being
disposed of, the first, fifth and sixth may be taken together. The ground may
first be cleared by dealing with the objection that the accused were not all
those engaged in the manufacture of corrugated and solid fibreboard boxes or
shipping containers. It was pointed out that the count in the indictment
alleged that the accused conspired together and with one another and with ten
other named companies or individuals not indicted, to unduly prevent or lessen
competition. While counsel for the Crown referred to certain documents as
indicating that the accused were all the manufacturers of the articles
mentioned, a perusal of these documents does not satisfy me that that
contention is correct, but I am satisfied from the evidence that the accused
represented the great bulk of the industry. That was the conclusion of the
trial judge and of the Chief Justice of Ontario, and any difference of

[Page 158]

opinion on that score, in the Court of Appeal, would be on a
question of fact, as to which there is no appeal to this Court. The objection
that the convictions under clause (d) could not stand because of the
acquittals under clause (b) is of no moment, as this Court is not
concerned with anything except the question whether the convictions on the
first count are proper.

It was argued that it was not sufficient for the Crown to show an
agreement or arrangement, the effect of which would be unduly to prevent or
lessen competition, but that the agreement or arrangement must have been
intended by the accused to have that effect. This is not the meaning of the
enactment upon which the count was based. Mens rea is undoubtedly
necessary, but that requirement was met in these prosecutions when it was shown
that the appellants intended to enter, and did enter, into the very arrangement
found to exist. The offences mentioned in the statute in question in Attorney
General of Australia v. Adelaide Steamship Company[10]
were not complete without proof of the intent. As pointed out by Lord Parker at
page 798, an amending Act provided that in any prosecution for an offence
against certain sections of the main enactment,

the averments of the prosecutor contained in the
information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to be proved in the absence
of proof to the contrary, but so that the averment of intent shall not be
deemed sufficient to prove such intent.

This decision can have no application to a prosecution under
clause (d) of subsection 1 of section 498 of the Code.

The meaning of “unduly” in clause (d) of subsection 1 of
section 498 of the Code was considered in the criminal case of Stinson-Reeb
Builders Supply Company v. The King[11], where
Mr. Justice Mignault, speaking for the Court, quoted the following passage from
the judgment of the present Chief Justice of this Court in the civil case of Weidman
v. Shragge[12]:—

I have no hesitation in holding that as a rule an agreement
having for one of its direct and governing objects the establishment of a
virtual monopoly in the trade in an important article of commerce throughout a
considerable extent of territory by suppressing competition in that trade,
comes under the ban of the enactment.

[Page 159]

Mr. Justice Mignault also quoted the following passage from the
judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin (as he then was), at page 42:—

The prime question certainly must be, does it (the agreement
alleged to be obnoxious to section 498 ), however advantageous or even necessary
for the protection of the business interests of the parties, impose improper,
inordinate, excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition the
benefit of which is the right of every one?

Under the decision in the Stinson-Reeb case[13],
the public is entitled to the benefit of free competition except in so far as
it may be interfered with by valid legislation, and any party to an
arrangement, the direct object of which is to impose improper, inordinate,
excessive or oppressive restrictions upon that competition, is guilty of an
offence. A comparison between section 498 of the Code and section 498A (which
was enacted subsequent to the decision in the Stinson-Reeb case13)
indicates that there has not been any change in the rule. Once an agreement is
arrived at, whether anything be done to carry it out or not, the matter must be
looked at in each case as a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal
of fact upon a common sense view as to the direct object of the arrangement
complained of. The evidence in these cases of what was done is merely better
evidence of that object than would exist where no act in furtherance of the common
design had been committed. So viewing the matter, there can be no question
that, not only was there some evidence upon which the trial judge could
convict, but the evidence was overwhelming that all the appellants at one time
or another conspired, combined, agreed or arranged to prevent or lessen
competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale,
transportation or supply of corrugated and solid fibre boxes or shipping
containers, and that they conspired to do so unduly.

This applies as well to Superior Box Company Limited as to the
other appellants. It is true that this Company, as well as several others, did
not sign any agreement, but the correspondence between it and Container
Materials Limited and other admissible evidence shows that it paid a portion of
the expenses of Container Materials Limited; that it submitted to inspection;
that its representatives were present at various meetings; that it contributed
to the costs of the Acme contract; and that it had a knowledge of

[Page 160]

and contributed to the cost of the Building Products purchase.
Instead of the position of this appellant being, as put in its factum,
“entirely consistent with an intention to make the best of conditions as we
found them and over which we had no control”, the truth of the matter is that
the Company became a member of the conspiracy and actually acted in conjunction
with the others, although, on occasions, it sought to free itself from some of
its fetters and succeeded in securing, from time to time, special advantages
not enjoyed by the others.

The appeals should be dissmised.
