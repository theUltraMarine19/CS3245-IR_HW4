(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court):
The appellant was convicted on a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) of trafficking by transporting six packets of heroin containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine in taxi SH 2894G from Bishan Street 22 to Ophir Road between 11.45am and 12noon on 19 July 1996. He was sentenced to death. We heard his appeal on 17 March 1997 which we dismissed without calling on the deputy public prosecutor. We now give our reasons.
The facts are not in dispute. In fact the appellant admitted at the trial that when he was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers at Ophir Road, he was in possession of a black carrier bag which contained a white nylon sack, inside which were six packets of heroin, which were later found to contain 294.5g of diamorphine, the subject matter of the charge. However, he maintained, as will be seen later, that until he had examined the contents of the six packets in the taxi on his way back to People`s Park Complex, he believed he was carrying spare parts for his friend, one Ah Poh. On making this discovery he had panicked and had immediately re-directed the taxi driver to Golden Mile Complex at Beach Road where he hoped to find Ah Poh and confront him. It was then that the CNB officers, who were trailing him, had stopped the taxi at Ophir Road and arrested him. Accordingly, his defence was that he was an innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin.
The appellant had arrived at Bishan Street 22 in taxi SH 2894G from People`s Park Complex where he lived at about 11.40am. At Bishan Street 22 the appellant had directed the taxi driver to proceed to the car park at Block 253 and wait for him whilst the appellant alighted saying he would return shortly. He did return shortly and directed the taxi driver to take him to a coffeeshop at another car park in the vicinity. He had already arranged with the taxi driver to hire his taxi for the next two to three hours. At the second car park the taxi driver went to the coffeeshop for coffee and saw the appellant also taking coffee there. After taking his coffee the taxi driver returned to his taxi to wait for the appellant. After a while the appellant joined him carrying a black carrier bag. He directed the taxi driver to return to the car park at Block 253, where he left the taxi saying he would return in a while. He left the black carrier bag in the taxi. A short while later the appellant returned to the taxi carrying a white nylon sack. He got in and told the taxi driver to take him back to People`s Park Complex.
The foregoing is a digest of the taxi driver`s evidence at the trial.
The appellant`s arrival at the car park at Block 253, Bishan Street 22 was witnessed by a team of four CNB officers. They had arrived there shortly before 11am. They were acting on information received. Their target was Block 253. Immediately on arrival they had surveyed Block 253 and had seen a cardboard box on the staircase landing between levels three and four. The box was approximately one foot square. It was sealed with yellow masking tape. The four CNB officers positioned themselves strategically so that one or two amongst them could observe the car park beside Block 253 and the void deck at the ground level while the others could observe the movements of anyone going to the cardboard box. They were in `walkie-talkie` contact with each other.
At about 11.40am one of the CNB officers spotted the appellant at the void deck of Block 253 talking to someone on his mobile phone. The other CNB officers were immediately alerted. The sum total of the CNB officers` evidence was that the appellant was seen going up the staircase to the landing where the cardboard box was and returning to the taxi carrying what was later identified as the white nylon sack. One of the CNB officers also testified that she had trailed the appellant and whilst she was at the staircase landing between the second and third levels of Block 253, she had heard the sound of paper being torn coming from the level above. It will be remembered that the cardboard box was on the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253. After the appellant had left in the taxi the cardboard box was found opened and empty.
The route taken by the taxi driver to return to People`s Park Complex from Bishan Street 22 was Bishan Road, Braddell Road and onto the Central Expressway to the City. However, when they were on the Central Expressway the appellant directed the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex in Beach Road instead. The taxi driver in his evidence said that he then turned off the Central Expressway into Bukit Timah Road and was proceeding along Ophir Road when he had to slow down in the traffic between Queen Street and Johore Road. It was then that the CNB officers who had been trailing the taxi since it left Bishan Street 22 boarded the taxi and arrested the appellant.
The appellant was seated in the rear seat of the taxi. He had with him the black carrier bag referred to earlier. This was seized by Inspector Chow Toong Chee (Insp Chow), who was following the CNB car trailing the taxi. Insp Chow asked the appellant what he had in the black carrier bag. The appellant answered that he had six bundles of white powder. The questions and answers were in the Hokkien dialect and duly recorded by Insp Chow and initialled by the appellant. After that Insp Chow unzipped the black carrier bag and took out the white nylon sack which was inside it. The white nylon sack contained the six packets of heroin which the scientific evidence showed contained 294.5g of diamorphine.
To further questioning by Insp Chow the appellant said that he had taken the six packets of heroin which were in the white nylon sack from a cardboard box at `Bishan Blk 253`. These questions and answers were also in the Hokkien dialect and duly recorded by Insp Chow and initialled by the appellant. Both these statements were admitted in evidence as part of the prosecution`s evidence without objection from the appellant. It was also in evidence that later the appellant was taken to Block 253 at Bishan Street 22 where he identified the cardboard box from which he had taken the white nylon sack containing the six packets of heroin. The cardboard box was opened and empty. It was the same cardboard box the CNB officers had seen earlier.
The final piece of evidence admitted by the prosecution as part of its case was the cautioned statement recorded from the appellant later that day. It was admitted without objection from the appellant and read: `I have nothing to say`.
Very properly defence counsel did not make a submission of `no case to answer` and the learned judge quite rightly called on the appellant to make his defence. The appellant gave evidence on oath. He called no witnesses.
He said that he lived in a rented room at People`s Park Complex and although he was a carpenter, he earned most of his living by selling contraband cigarettes. On an average he earned about $1,000 per day which he had to share with the van driver who assisted him in making the deliveries. Generally his share was between $500 to $600 per day. His deliveries took him to as far as Jurong. He had met Ah Poh through selling contraband cigarettes to him. On two or three previous occasions he had obliged Ah Poh by delivering spare parts to an acquaintance in Jurong.
In fact on the day previous to the one in question, Ah Poh had contacted him and inquired whether he would be making any deliveries in Jurong that day and if so, whether he would again deliver some spare parts for him to his acquaintance in Jurong. The appellant had agreed as he was going to make deliveries in Jurong the next day and agreed to meet Ah Poh at Block 253, Bishan Street 22 before going to Jurong. He arrived at about 11.40am.
However when he arrived at Bishan Street 22, Ah Poh was nowhere to be seen; but no sooner than he had arrived Ah Poh called him on his mobile phone and told the appellant to go to the coffee shop and wait for him there. So he proceeded in the taxi in which he had come to the coffee shop nearby and ordered himself a cup of coffee. Ah Poh called again on his mobile phone and told the appellant that he could not join him at the coffee shop and requested the appellant to meet him at the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253. He agreed but before going there he purchased a black carrier bag which, he said, would be useful to carry the contraband cigarettes.
He had kept the taxi in which he had come from People`s Park Complex where he lived. He returned to the car park at Block 253, told the taxi driver to wait and went to Block 253 leaving the black carrier bag he had just purchased in the taxi. Ah Poh was not there. He was returning to the taxi when Ah Poh called him again on his mobile phone, told him he could see the appellant from where he was (though the appellant could not see Ah Poh) and persuaded the appellant to pick up the box of spare parts from the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253 as he, Ah Poh, was not free to meet him.
The appellant duly obliged. He went to the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels and there was the cardboard box as Ah Poh had said. He lifted it. It was heavy. He peeled off the masking tape and opened the cardboard box. Inside he found a white nylon sack which was also heavy. He decided to leave the cardboard box behind and carried the white nylon sack to the taxi and left in it, having directed the taxi driver to return to People`s Park Complex.
Once the taxi was on its way he decided to see what was in the white nylon sack. On the previous occasions he had delivered spare parts for Ah Poh, he had examined the packages to assure himself that he was in fact carrying spare parts. On this occasion to his utter dismay, he found he was carrying heroin and not spare parts. He was momentarily dazed and upset. He was angry with Ah Poh and wanted to confront him. By this time the taxi was already on the Central Expressway. He suddenly remembered that Ah Poh often frequented Golden Mile area. He directed the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex instead. When the taxi slowed down in traffic along Ophir Road, CNB officers boarded the taxi and arrested him.
When the appellant was asked why he did not go straight to the CNB, as on this occasion he had been fooled by Ah Poh into carrying heroin to his acquaintance in Jurong instead of spare parts as before, his response was that he would not be believed and would certainly be arrested for being in possession of such a large quantity of heroin. On the other hand, he was afraid to throw it away as he feared Ah Poh would become nasty and seek revenge against him. In fact the appellant went on to say that he was not oblivious to the fact he was being watched when he went to collect the spare parts, as he recognized one of the CNB officers as the same person he had seen observing him in Shanghai Road, when he had gone there some three days before to collect money from Ah Poh. He had then thought that the person was a customs officer and was not unnerved when he saw him again at Block 253 as he was not carrying contraband cigarettes but, as he thought, spare parts.
The appellant was also questioned why he had not told Insp Chow when questioned upon arrest that he thought he was carrying spare parts for Ah Poh, if that was what he genuinely thought he was doing until he discovered the stark reality in the taxi that it was heroin instead, and why he had admitted that what he was in possession of and carrying was heroin, his answer was that he was in such a state of surprise and daze that it did not occur to him to tell Insp Chow that the white nylon sack seized was not his, and that when he took it he genuinely thought it contained spare parts. When asked why in his cautioned statement he said that he had `nothing to say` he replied that he thought he would not be believed had he told the truth and furthermore he was under fear of being assaulted by the officers.
It is evident from the foregoing that the defence of the appellant was that he was an `innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin`. His version of the events was that he did not know he was in possession of heroin until he had opened the packets when he was in the taxi returning to People`s Park Complex and what he did after making this discovery was to go and confront Ah Poh for having exposed him to such a grave capital offence.
The learned trial judge found that on `the undisputed facts` the appellant was `in possession of a bag which contained not less than 294.5g of diamorphine`. We agreed with this finding. Next, the learned trial judge relied on the well-known and settled proposition of law that possession of a parcel is very strong evidence of possession of its contents as enunciated by the House of Lords in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
 in proof of the appellant`s knowledge, subject nevertheless to the appellant`s explanation, that he was in possession of the heroin. The learned trial judge then considered the appellant`s explanation which he said `did not appear to have any ring of truth around them`, concluding with this sentence: 
 
Above all, I found his story that he was in fact on his way to confront Ah Poh at Golden Mile with all the heroin in the bag where he hoped to meet with Ah Poh as the latter was wont to frequent that area, totally unworthy of any credit.
 
 
 
Not only was the appellant`s story that he was on his way to confront Ah Poh, the moment he had seen on examining the contents of the white nylon sack that it contained heroin and not spare parts, totally unworthy of any credit, to use the learned judge`s words, it was plainly an untruth if what the appellant said in his evidence that he was on the point of leaving Block 523, when Ah Poh called him on his mobile phone and told him that he could see the appellant from where he was, (although the appellant could not see Ah Poh) and Ah Poh had persuaded him to return to the third and fourth level staircase landing and collect the cardboard box containing the spare parts was true . It followed that Ah Poh could not possibly have been at Golden Mile Complex or that the whole of the appellant`s evidence about Ah Poh and conveying spare parts for Ah Poh to his acquaintance in Jurong was a fabricated story. Anyhow, the inference is irresistible that the appellant re-routed the taxi to Golden Mile Complex for some reason connected with the heroin he was carrying and not for the purpose of confronting Ah Poh. Furthermore, the manner in which Ah Poh contacted the appellant on his arrival at Bishan Street 22 strongly suggests that Ah Poh was physically present at Bishan Street 22 and observing the appellant unseen.
Finally, the learned trial judge invoked the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that the appellant`s possession of the six packets of heroin in the white nylon sack containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine was for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him as the presumption had not been rebutted. But the charge was one of `trafficking by transporting` and not of `trafficking by being in possession`. However that may be, no submissions were made to us that the appellant was transporting the heroin other than for trafficking. The gravamen of the appellant`s defence was that he was duped by Ah Poh into transporting the heroin and that when he discovered that what he was transporting was heroin and not spare parts as he was made to believe, he decided to confront Ah Poh and re-directed the taxi driver to proceed to Golden Mile Complex and not to People`s Park Complex. Presumably what the appellant intended was to return the heroin to Ah Poh and if this was so it would still be trafficking by transporting. See 
 Tan Meng Jee v PP 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 422
; see also 
 PP v Goh Hock Huat 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 274
.
The further points taken on appeal were (a) that the appellant`s evidence that on discovering that he was carrying heroin and not spare parts had immediately redirected the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh ought to have been accepted; and (b) that the admission of certain paragraphs of the appellant`s investigation or long statements at the very end of the trial, after the appellant had given evidence and during cross-examination under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, had gravely prejudiced the appellant and resulted in a miscarriage of justice; although the avowed intention was to impeach the appellant`s credibility as a witness under s 157 of the Evidence Act, in fact the purpose was to `ambush the appellant in the witness box` as graphically put by appellant`s counsel.
We see no merit at all in point (a) although it was contended on the appellant`s behalf that his evidence of re-routing was confirmed by the taxi driver`s evidence. Even if this was accepted it would not prove that the appellant was going to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh. We have dealt with this point adequately in the paragraphs above and need not repeat them again.
As for point (b), admittedly the tactics employed by the learned deputy public prosecutor at the trial (who was not the deputy public prosecutor at the appeal) were criticised by the learned trial judge but in truth the learned deputy public prosecutor could not be faulted. We have read the transcripts of the evidence and we are satisfied that the learned deputy public prosecutor was not attempting to supplement the prosecution`s evidence or to withhold material evidence but genuinely desiring to impeach the appellant`s credibility as a witness in view of many inconsistencies in his evidence. We therefore see no substance in this point also.
What we have said in the paragraph above can be demonstrated quite simply. It will be remembered that in his evidence the appellant said that the reason why he wanted to go to Golden Mile Complex was to confront Ah Poh but in his statement he stated quite unequivocally that he told the taxi driver to take him to a place opposite Golden Landmark Hotel as he wanted to purchase small plastic sachets to repack the heroin as he had finished his previously bought plastic sachets. This one statement completely demolished the whole of his evidence of being an innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin who on discovering that he had been duped by Ah Poh was going to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh. The appellant was shown to be a witness whose evidence was unworthy of credit. In our view the evidence contained in the statement referred to above was rightly admitted in evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.
In fact there was no prejudice to the appellant as the procedures for the impeachment proceedings were meticulously carried out by the learned trial judge and defence counsel was given reasonable time to take instructions from the appellant on the statements before he was cross-examined thereon.
It was for these reasons that we dismissed this appeal.
