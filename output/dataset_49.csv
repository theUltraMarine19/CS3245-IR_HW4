2701285,Goode v Angland [2016] NSWSC 1014,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 29 June 2009, Mr Goode was riding a horse named Shot of the Rails in race 7 over 1640 metres at the Queanbeyan Racecourse. Mr Angland was a jockey riding Port Gallery in the same race. Shortly after the start of the race Mr Goode was thrown from his mount when it fell. Mr Goode sustained catastrophic injuries which have left him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
	
	
	Mr Goode alleges in these proceedings that his injuries, loss and damage were caused by Mr Angland’s negligence or breach of duty by riding in such a manner as to cause interference to Mr Goode and his mount. Mr Angland denies these allegations.
	


Background


	
	In the events that occurred, the actual incident that gives rise to these proceedings, as well as the events immediately preceding and succeeding it, are captured on video by a series of cameras located at various points around the Queanbeyan Racecourse. These video recordings, as well as a large series of still pictures derived from them, became evidence in these proceedings. It will be necessary in due course to refer to this photographic material in order to assess, if possible, precisely what it reveals about Mr Goode’s claims and Mr Angland’s competing contentions. This is referred to in more detail later in these reasons.
	
	
	It would appear to be almost a universal practice these days for video recording of professional horseraces at metropolitan, regional and country race meetings throughout Australia. The Court specifically convened for the showing of these videos at the British Horseracing Authority at High Holborn in London so that they could be viewed, utilizing simultaneous split screen projections of the race in general and of Mr Goode’s fall in particular, from various angles, together with additional assistance of slow motion and freeze frame functions.
	


The video recordings


	
	The video recordings of the race included depictions of the fall from the side and from the rear. Side views of the fall are helpful in assessing or estimating the relationship among the runners in terms of lengths or fractions of a length throughout the race but in particular in the moments leading up to the fall. It is uncontroversial that all of the horses in the race changed positions relative to all other horses as the race progressed. The side view at the point of Mr Goode’s fall is of assistance in considering the relative movements fore and aft of all of the horses in the race in general and specifically the proximity of Mr Goode’s mount to the horse ridden by Mr Angland, bearing in mind the allegation that Mr Goode’s horse clipped the heels of Mr Angland’s horse when the distance or space between them had, for whatever reason, become unsafely reduced.
	
	
	The rear view of the race is correspondingly helpful in assessing the lateral movements of the horses throughout the race. In general terms the runners were in formations of between two and three horses off the rails in the moments leading up to the fall. There would appear to be a centrifugal tendency for the horses to move away from the rails when running through a bend in the track. Mr Goode alleges that Mr Angland steered his horse in toward the rails as Mr Goode’s horse was making a run into a gap between it and another runner. The rear view of the race provides assistance in assessing the relative lateral movements of these and other horses at this time.
	
	
	It is however not practically possible in these reasons to give a complete or comprehensive running commentary on how the videos depict the race from these various angles and locations. That task is only manageable by selected references to the large number of still photographs or screenshots captured and assembled from the moving pictures.
	


The still photographs - screenshots


	
	The still photographs of the race have been assembled in four folders that correspond to each of the four video cameras that recorded it. They are variously described as Head On, Lateral View, Back Straight and Home Turn. These pictures all carry a digital date and time imprint on the face of the picture. It is generally accepted that the timing devices for all cameras were in sequence, so that any two or more pictures from various camera angles that show the same time also depict precisely the same moment in the race.
	
	
	In addition to these separate smaller folders, I was provided with a larger folder described as Comparative Camera Angles, which became exhibit “AC”. The larger folder consisted of a series of photographs extracted from three of the smaller folders containing reproductions of simultaneously exposed pictures taken from those smaller folders but displayed together on a single page. This compilation of simultaneously exposed photographs permitted a convenient examination of forty discrete moments in the race in sequences of up to three photographs at a time taken from as many different angles.
	


Comment


	
	Even though all of this photographic material was extremely helpful, it cannot provide a single unambiguous answer to the liability issues in this case. The dynamic and to some extent unpredictable nature of horseracing is one reason for this. Another is that the moving and still photographic material does not of its very nature foreclose the possibility of varying and competing contentions or opinions about what it reveals. Moreover, the pictures must necessarily be considered having regard to the evidence of Mr Goode and Mr Angland in particular, as well as the evidence of the several other lay witnesses who have offered recollections of what they saw and heard, together with the competing expert opinions about what the stewards’ inquiry, the rules of racing and the photographic evidence reveal. These matters are all considered in more detail below.
	
	
	It should also be noted that notwithstanding these limitations, all of the expert opinions offered on the issue of Mr Angland’s liability draw heavily upon what the cameras have captured of the race and Mr Goode’s fall. There is also little in dispute between the parties that does not revolve around competing interpretations of what the footage of the race reveals. The expert determinations in this case are therefore significantly fact-driven, rather than being concerned with the existence and content of a duty, the standard of care that applied or what does or does not amount to a failure to comply with it. One significant consequence of this is that the proceedings have not given rise to any issues of credit between or among the parties, the lay witnesses or the experts. I consider that all witnesses have done their best either to recall from memory what happened during the race or to offer honest opinions about what the video of the race actually reveals or both.
	


Mr Goode’s evidence on liability


	
	On 29 June 2009, Mr Goode was riding at the Queanbeyan Races. He had five rides during that day. It was his recollection that he had been riding “reasonably well”. Mr Goode was injured during the last race of the day, Race 7 being the Cemex Building Your Future Class 1 Handicap over 1460 metres. He rode a horse named Shot of the Rails. Mr Goode had never ridden that horse before. It did not have very good form. Mr Goode said that he was not expecting to win or even do well in the race. He also said that he did not know what to expect from the horse. However, Mr Goode said that he wanted to ride and respond to the horse in order to give it the best chance.
	
	
	Mr Goode’s horse was drawn wide. He had no recollection of anything unusual about the start of the race. Mr Goode said that he came out of the barrier and was sitting fairly close to the back of the field. The race was unremarkable until the horses approached the 1000 metre mark. Mr Goode’s horse was sitting close to the back of the pack. He saw two horses ahead of him. One was Mr Angland’s horse ahead and to his left. The other horse was ridden by Brad Clark which was on the rails. Both horses were about two lengths ahead of his mount. Mr Goode described these horses as “virtually side by side”. Mr Goode then said that he saw Mr Angland’s horse “move out to its left”, leaving a gap between him and Mr Clark’s horse. He described that gap as “a good horse”, which in these proceedings is accepted uncontroversially to mean a space into which another horse might safely advance or “improve”. Mr Angland’s horse was at that time according to Mr Goode “a good three to four horses from the rail”.
	
	
	Mr Goode said that at that point he took the opportunity to improve his horse’s position by moving into the gap. He said that he remained in that position “for at least three or four strides”. At this point Mr Goode said that he saw Mr Angland’s horse “shift back to its right closing the gap between his horse and Clark’s horse”. In his statement of evidence dated 5 October 2015, Mr Goode said that he shouted “Tye!”. In the course of his oral evidence before me Mr Goode said that he shouted instead “Fuck, Tye!”. This apparent difference is referred to in more detail below. At all events, Mr Angland did not respond. Mr Goode said that Mr Angland did not look over his shoulder “before shifting his horse back towards its right”.
	
	
	Mr Goode then heard the sound of horses’ hooves coming into contact. His precise words were, “I then heard the sound of heels of my horse’s hoofs [sic, hooves] with his horse’s hoofs [sic]”. Mr Goode described the noise as “unmistakable”, or as “a metallic clanking sound”. Mr Goode’s horse stumbled and fell to the ground.
	
	
	Mr Goode was cross-examined. He agreed that horses shifting either in or out is a common occurrence in races and that the possibility of a horse shifting one way or the other during a race and interfering with another horse was a day-to-day incident of horseracing. Horses do not run in an absolutely straight line.
	
	
	Mr Goode also agreed that he did not tell the stewards’ inquiry that he had called out to Mr Angland immediately before his fall. Nor did he mention this in his evidentiary statement. However, he denied that his evidence before me that he did so was untruthful.
	
	
	Mr Goode acknowledged that in his evidence at the stewards’ inquiry he said that his horse was over racing. This occurred about 300 metres from the start of the race. He agreed that over racing means that a horse is unsettled and that it is exhibiting a tendency to race forward in a manner that needs to be controlled by the jockey. A horse that is over racing exhibits a tendency to push forward when compared to the other horses around it. Mr Goode agreed that his mount stumbled a few seconds, or roughly eight strides, before the fall and that the stumble was the result of it over racing. Mr Goode denied that he was having any difficulty controlling his horse but agreed that he had to stand in the stirrups in order to do so. He also agreed that his horse was throwing its head in the air a few seconds before the fall, but he denied that it was for that reason harder to control.
	
	
	Mr Goode agreed that he had told the stewards’ inquiry that Mr Angland’s mount “had shot off a touch”. He agreed that he had intended by the use of that expression to indicate that Mr Angland’s horse had moved away from the inside running rail. Mr Goode then said that “a run has produced itself”, by which he meant to indicate that a gap had opened between Mr Angland’s horse and the horse closer to the inside running rail. Mr Goode told the stewards’ inquiry that at that point his “mount was then forward into the run”, meaning that his horse advanced relative to these other two horses.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Goode in cross-examination that the film of the race made it clear that Mr Angland’s horse did not shift inside of the line of the horse in front of him. Mr Goode disagreed with that suggestion. He also disagreed with the suggestion that when he told the stewards’ inquiry that “Tye’s horse has just shifted in a touch” he had intended to indicate that Mr Angland’s horse had shifted in very slightly immediately before the fall. Mr Goode specifically denied that if Mr Angland’s horse shifted laterally back towards the rails, it was not a shift of a sufficient distance to cause him to call out to Mr Angland. Mr Goode also denied in that same context that the horse inside him being ridden by Brad Clark shifted out away from the inside running rail immediately before the accident or that Mr Goode’s horse also shifted out laterally away from the running rail at the same time.
	
	
	Mr Goode denied that Mr Angland’s horse did not change its line when or as the fall occurred. He agreed with the proposition that in order to advance safely into a gap between horses a rider needs more space when the horses are racing on a turn than when running straight. Mr Goode accepted that when that occurred, one or other of the horses in front might shift laterally, whether or not the jockeys on those horses intended that movement to occur. Mr Goode agreed that horses have minds of their own and that it is not always possible to keep them running in a straight line.
	
	
	Finally, it was put to Mr Goode that the gap between Mr Angland’s horse and Brad Clark’s horse into which he advanced was not sufficiently wide for him to have done so safely when racing around that particular turn at Queanbeyan. Mr Goode disagreed. Mr Goode also disagreed that in the two or three seconds before his horse fell, his horse shifted to the left and away from the inside running rail by at least two horse widths.
	


Mr Angland’s evidence on liability


	
	Mr Angland provided a statement dated 14 August 2015. He confirmed that he was riding Port Gallery in the race in which Mr Goode was injured. He reviewed the video material before preparing his statement. However, Mr Angland said that his unassisted recollection of what occurred during the race was as follows.
	
	
	At no time during the race did Mr Angland feel any interference. He learned of Mr Goode’s fall after the race. He did not hear Mr Goode call out his name or anything at all. Mr Angland said that his mount was not racing erratically and he did not have difficulty controlling it during the race.
	
	
	Mr Angland commented upon the race footage as follows. He said that as he approached the 1400 metre mark he shifted out approximately half a horse. He said that this was not uncommon at this point on that track because the turn there is tighter than most turns on other racetracks. Mr Angland said that in his experience of riding at Queanbeyan, jockeys generally allow their horses a bit more space there in the event that “other riders get shot out as they negotiate the turn”.
	
	
	As he approached the 1100 to 1000 metre mark just after the turn, Mr Angland said that his horse maintained its racing line. He said that “at no time do I cause it to shift in”. He said that at around that point he was approximately two lengths ahead and to the left of Mr Goode and parallel to and outside Mr Clark riding Dexter’s Angel. Mr Clark was positioned approximately two lengths ahead and to the right of Mr Goode and close to the rails. Mr Angland said that at this stage the gap between him and Mr Clark was approximately half a horse.
	
	
	Mr Angland said that immediately before the fall, Mr Goode’s horse was over racing. He said that this was apparent from the fact that Mr Goode can be seen attempting to restrain his mount by pulling back on the reins and standing up in the saddle. Mr Goode’s horse was throwing its head into the air.
	
	
	Mr Goode’s horse then improved its position by moving between him and Mr Clark. He described the position as “very tight”. Mr Angland said that immediately before the fall he was maintaining his racing line. He said that after shifting out at the 1400 metre mark, he at no time thereafter shifted to the inside of the horse in front. Mr Clark’s horse shifted out away from the rails, which he had earlier described as common on that turn at Queanbeyan Racecourse.
	
	
	Mr Angland was cross-examined. He continued to maintain that the turn at the 1100 metre mark at the Queanbeyan Racecourse was one of the tightest turns on any racetrack he had ever ridden on. However, Mr Angland conceded that in terms of simple geometry, the turn at the 600 metre mark was clearly the tightest turn on the track. He denied that his evidence in describing the turn at 1400 metres as one of the tightest turns he had ever encountered at any track upon which he had ridden in Australia was intended to provide an excuse for his mount having moved out during the race. He also insisted that, having moved out at that point in the race, he continued to maintain his line. He denied that he steered his horse in. That denial was reaffirmed in his evidence at the start of his second day of cross-examination as follows:
	


“Q. You can see your horse with the very prominent white blaze?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you not agree that the blaze is turned quite markedly towards the rails in that photograph?

A. Well, slightly.

Q. Do you not agree that your right arm - the elbow seems to be held back on the right side?

A. No, it’s in a normal position.

Q. If the horse’s head is turned towards the rails, that would indicate that you were steering it towards the rails, wouldn’t it?

A. Not really, no.

Q. If there’s a combination of your right arm being back and the blaze being turned towards the rails, that would indicate that you were steering the horse towards the rails, doesn’t it?

A. I didn’t agree my arm was back.

Q. No, but if it were--

A. If.

Q. If it were and if the blaze were pointing towards the rails then that would indicate that you were attempting at least to steer it towards the rails?

A. Yes.”


	
	Mr Angland attended the stewards’ inquiry and agreed that he had read the transcript of the proceedings. Mr Angland denied that he caused interference that led to Mr Goode’s fall. He also denied that he had ever been accused of causing it. He continued to deny that, having moved out, he “then rolled back in”.
	
	
	Mr Angland had referred at the inquiry to “interference”. He was asked about that during his cross-examination as follows:
	


“Q. Who caused the interference that you’re describing at line 212 if it wasn’t you?

A. It was Paul’s horse. It didn’t make the corner.

Q. I see?

A. It was over racing and you could see that and a horse running around a bend that is over racing throwing its head is not going to make a corner like a normal horse would. The inside horses have come out to meet me. I keep a neat line and that’s where the interference happens. You can watch the film. If you look at the photos, it is all obvious in that.

Q. Did you suffer any interference?

A. No, I didn’t and like I say, the video proves that.”


	
	Mr Angland was pressed about whether his horse rolled or moved in, or Mr Clark’s horse moved out, and whether Mr Goode had been presented with a good horse, meaning a gap between them into which it was safe to improve. He said this:
	


“His horse is over racing, running into a corner. When you’re over racing and you’re fighting with a horse around a corner, they’re not going to corner as well as a horse that is relaxed, comfortable, with the rider in full control. Therefore, he has stepped out a fraction, a slight fraction. He’s come out and he’s just grabbed a heel. It just takes a minor clip and that’s what’s happened, very unfortunately.”


	
	Mr Angland maintained his view that no safe run had presented itself to Mr Goode. He said:
	


“Not a full safe run at all, not the way his horse was racing, and I’ve stated that numerous times.”


	
	Mr Angland emphasised that he was not aware that Mr Goode was moving into the gap between him and Mr Clark. He said that he told the stewards that on a number of occasions “because that’s the truth”. He said, “I was unaware again that Mr Goode was there and there was no call for me to be aware that he was there and that’s when the incident happened”.
	
	
	Mr Angland also agreed that he said the following things at the stewards’ inquiry:
	


“Once we sort of got around the corner, I wasn’t aware that Paul was there and I didn’t think anyone would have come up to my inside and that’s when, like I wouldn’t, I didn’t give, I didn’t think, I believe I gave a full run for a horse to approach my inside and that is when we sort of got back around the corner and that’s when I come back in my half horse”.


	
	Mr Angland said that he played no part in his horse either moving out or moving back in. He said, “That’s the way my horse took the corner”. He agreed in that context that what his horse did was beyond his control. He said of thoroughbred race horses generally, “we can do our best to control them but at the end of the day they’ve got a mind of their own”.
	
	
	Mr Angland was then challenged as follows:
	


“Q. But if you had looked, you would have seen him improving into it, wouldn’t you?

A. I can’t look behind me the whole race. That’s not, I can’t, I’m not there, we haven’t got eyes on the back of our head where we focus on what’s around us and if there’s a call, we look and then we do whatever we can to prevent, to help. We’re going forwards at high speeds. It’s like driving a car and looking in the rear vision mirror all the time. You don’t do it. That just sums it up. If you hear something or notice something, you obviously have a look. It’s a natural reaction but if you’re driving down a freeway at 110 kilometres an hour, you’re not going to look in the rear vision mirror the whole time. You see what objects are coming, what’s happening in front of you the way the cars are going. Cars are turning off, you obviously have a look before you move.

Q. Mr Angland, when the race started and the horses are coming from the barrier over towards the rails, you can see jockeys looking over their shoulder to see if it’s safe to move across, can’t you?

A. They do, sir, yes.

Q. That’s pretty standard practice, isn’t it?

A. It is if you’re shifting over.

Q. That’s all you had to do in this case, wasn’t it? Look over your shoulder and then you would have seen Mr Goode coming up into the gap.

A. No.

Q. Why didn’t you look over your shoulder?

A. Because my, it wasn’t intended, it’s a one stride thing. You’re out and you’re in and at that point of the race, jockeys look over their shoulders when they’re coming out wide to cross horses into a position. They don’t go the whole race looking over their shoulder.

Q. Of course, he did shout out, didn’t he?

A. No, he didn’t. That is something that he has made up since.

Q. You say he’s made that up.

A. He has and I know that for a fact.

Q. So you say you didn’t have to look because he didn’t shout.

A. No, because I wasn’t aware of a horse that was inside. I’m not going to ride a whole race looking inside me.”


	
	On the following day, Mr Angland gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Mr Angland, I was asking you some questions yesterday about your horse moving out and then moving back in. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. Let’s get this clear. You agreed that you did move out and then move back in, don’t you?

A. Very minimal, not under my guidance.

Q. The answer to that is yes.

A. Not under my guidance.

Q. No, but the answer is that you did move out and then move back in?

A. Myself or my horse?

Q. Your horse with you on it?

A. Not under my control.

Q. Yes or no?

A. Well, there’s

…

Q. You say that was all in the space of about one stride?

A. Yeah, very - yeah, one or two strides, split seconds.

Q. Split second?

A. Split seconds, yeah. It’s very quick.

Q. Could you move out half a horse in a split second?

A. Every horse is different.

Q. Did you move out half a horse in that split second?

A. Myself or my horse?

Q. Let’s just assume that when I say ‘you’, I mean you and your horse?

A. But like I said, some horses don’t take corners as good as others, so it’s not my control. It wasn’t my choice to move out and then back in.”


	
	Mr Angland agreed with the following suggestion:
	


“Q. You accept in your statement, don’t you, that the front legs of Mr Goode’s horse may well have clipped the back legs of your horse?

A. It’s a possibility. I wouldn’t say there’s any proof or there’s no evidence if it did but it’s a possibility.

Q. That’s based on your recollection of the race and of your viewing of the race?

A. Correct.”


	
	Mr Angland maintained throughout that his horse did not move in at any time or in a way that related to Mr Goode’s fall. For example:
	


“Q. Mr Angland, in your evidence so far you have spoken about Mr Clark moving off the rails. Is that right?

A. Correct.

Q. That was a factor, do you say, in Mr Goode’s fall?

A. Correct. A contributing factor.

Q. I’m sorry?

A. A contributing factor.

Q. Do you in your statement point to the fact that Mr Goode’s horse appeared to be over racing?

A. Yes. That’s very obvious.

Q. Was that a contributing factor?

A. Yes.

Q. You have agreed that your horse moved in half a horse?

A. Not at the point of the fall, no.

Q. Perhaps I should put this differently. Whether or not you were in control of your horse, do you agree that Port Gallery moved back towards the rails just before the fall?

A. I think a few strides before. Yes; not that it had - not that I contributed. My horse did fractionally get back in, yes.

Q. It’s a combination of the three factors you say, isn’t it, Mr Clark moving out, Mr Goode over racing and Port Gallery moving in? It’s a combination of those three factors that caused the fall?

A. Yes, and that’s what the stewards’ inquiry concluded as well. No rider at fault.

Q. But you say of course that your mount moved back in because you couldn’t control it?

A. This was before the fall. My horse stepped out a fraction on the point of the corner and as we rounded the corner, he stepped back in a fraction.

Q. But just so it’s as clear as it can be, you’re not prepared to accept on behalf of yourself or your horse sole responsibility--

A. No.

Q. --for the fall?

A. No.

Q. But you do accept that your horse’s movement was a contributing factor to the fall?

A. My movement was before the fall.

Q. You do accept, don’t you, that your horse’s movement was a contributing factor to the fall?

A. Like I stated, my movement was a few strides before; so my position two strides before the fall and then Paul’s horse was over racing and didn’t make the corner as well as the other horses, and that’s when he struck trouble and that’s when he grabbed a heel.

Q. But it’s three things, isn’t it, that contribute to this fall; (1) you say Mr Clark moving off the rails?

A. Correct.

Q. Second, Mr Goode over racing?

A. Correct.

Q. And third, Port Gallery moving back towards the rails?

A. Like I stated just before, my horse had already found a position. I was already - I didn’t move two, three strides before it. They come across to meet my heels.

Q. Do you accept--

A. No.

Q. --that you or your horse was a contributing factor towards the fall?

A. My horse was outside him, so I don’t agree with that, no, because I had found my position and they come out to meet me, so I was there but I didn’t contribute to it.”


	
	Mr Angland’s cross-examination concluded with an extensive series of questions directed to the still photographs and suggestions as to what various pictures appeared to reveal. It is unnecessary for present purposes to summarise all of that evidence here. It is sufficient to note that it included the following:
	


“Q. Go back to 22, in the home turn, would you say Mr Clark is a horse off the rails there?

A. I wouldn’t say a full horse, no. No, that would be roughly about half a horse.

Q. So if that’s half a horse, then the gap between you and Mr Clark is more than one horse, isn’t it?

A. I wouldn’t say it’s - it would be a comfortable horse, it would be a horse, a horse, yeah, a comfortable horse.”

The stewards’ inquiry


	
	Racing NSW conducted an inquiry into Mr Goode’s fall on 12 March 2010. Several of the expert witnesses have referred to the transcript of those proceedings and it was tendered by Mr Goode. Neither party in these proceedings has suggested that the stewards’ inquiry produced a conclusion that is binding on me but both parties have sought to emphasise the significance in varying respects of the evidence given by witnesses who were called there, especially Mr Goode and Mr Angland. It is therefore important that the significant portions of their evidence to the stewards’ inquiry are recorded here.
	
	
	The Chairman conducted the inquiry in what appears to have been a semi-formal manner, calling upon the interested parties and witnesses to comment upon the video of the race and upon each other’s evidence. Although it does not correspond to the order in which each person gave his evidence to the inquiry, I have referred in what follows to that evidence witness by witness in order to give a clearer picture of their respective recollections.
	
	
	Mr Goode was asked by the Chairman if he remembered the fall. His response was as follows:
	


“Vaguely, sir. I just remember racing. I was second last, Nathan was just behind me. I was over racing a touch. I came back. I know it did get tight and then the next minute I was on the ground.”


	
	Mr Goode’s statement that he “came back” was intended to indicate that he came back to racing, in that his horse stopped over racing and he regained control of his mount.
	
	
	The video was then played and the Chairman asked Mr Goode whether he had any comments upon what he had observed. His response was as follows:
	


“Obviously you can see the mount was over racing a touch, and, as we have come to that point, and Tye’s mount has shot off a touch, the run has produced itself. My mount was then forward into the run and then unfortunately Tye’s horse has shifted in a touch and then that’s when I’ve come down.”


	
	The Chairman then asked Mr Goode the following question:
	


“There’s evidence been given that your mount was over racing with you – and this is regardless of whether there was room for you to improve at all – do you recall how your mount was travelling with you in the leadup to the fall?”


	
	Mr Goode answered in these terms:
	


“It was over racing a touch, then I pulled my mount back, came back a good half horse and then when I saw the run produce, I then just, without even myself giving it a dig to be there, I’ve just literally let the horse improve to be there and then, yeah, obviously it just got tight and that’s when I came down.”


	
	Mr Goode agreed with the Chairman that it was his intention “to improve into that position”. Mr Goode said that when he improved into that position he believed that there was “a good horse” between Mr Angland’s mount and Brad Clark’s mount and that it had been apparent for “a good few strides”. Mr Goode indicated later in the proceedings that he did not wish to add anything to what he had said.
	
	
	After the video footage had been shown by the stewards for the benefit of all those at the inquiry, the Chairman invited Mr Angland to comment upon what he saw. He said this:
	


“I was pretty much racing to the outside of Brad and sort of coming into the first corner, you can see there was a bit of interference in front of us, sort of give us a little bit of room. That corner you obviously get shot out a little bit. I probably come out half a horse and you can see Paul’s horse was over racing, sort of got up to the inside of me when I was unaware, so that we, sort of, come back to racing again and I think that’s when the interference happened.”


	
	It is apparent that the stewards had conducted an earlier inquiry on an unspecified date. Unfortunately only one page of transcript from that day is available. The fact of that earlier session is alluded to in the following question from the Chairman directed to Mr Angland:
	


“I’ll refer back to your initial evidence on the day in question – you do mention, I think on two occasions, what you refer to as ‘carnage’ in front of you. Can you elaborate on that? What was the interference you were referring to at that stage of the race? Do you believe that was borne out by the film?”


	
	Mr Angland responded in the following terms:
	


“Well, like, in – approaching into the first corner, I had Geppert – apprentice Geppert – to my outside coming back and it says in here – I can’t fully remember it now, but…”


	
	Mr Angland was then asked:
	


“I suppose my question to you, you did say you were watching that going on in front of you, did that have any bearing on your mount? Were you dictated to?”


	
	Mr Angland responded:
	


“I wouldn’t say I was dictated to, but obviously when you see a bit of carnage in front, you give yourself a bit of room if anything does happen, but it wasn’t bad. We’d just come into the first corner and pretty much every race in the 1400 metre corner you half get shot out for a little bit, I’ve probably rolled off half a horse. Paul Goode’s horse was over racing which ended up coming up to me on the inside when I wasn’t aware when I come back to normal racing pattern.”


	
	Mr Angland said that he did not receive any direct interference himself. He explained that when he said his mount rolled out half a horse, he believed that left half a horse to his inside between his mount and Brad Clark’s horse. Mr Angland also said that when he did roll off, there would have been “probably two strides” running on his inside for a runner to improve.
	
	
	Mr Angland was later asked for any final comments he might wish to make after having heard the evidence from all of the others. He said this:
	


“Yeah, I don’t really believe that there was a full run. Like, we were all coming into the first corner and every horse, every race – you can nearly say every horse does get shot off a bit and I just give myself a little bit of extra room because there was horses getting in a little bit of trouble in front and once we sort of got around the corner, I wasn’t aware that Paul was there and I didn’t think anyone would have come up to my inside and that’s when, like I wouldn’t – I didn’t give – I didn’t think – I believe I gave a full run for a horse to approach my inside and that is when we sort of got back around the corner and that’s when I come back in, my half horse.”


	
	Mr Angland agreed that just after his mount did get out, his horse shifted back in when he “just got back around the corner and come back to racing pattern”. He said, “I was shifting back in”. He was then asked why his mount shifted back in. Mr Angland responded as follows:
	


“Because we got back round the corner and on the corner, at Queanbeyan, you come, approaching into it, you sort of get shot out a little bit, once you approach back round, it’s still turning and my horse would have just come back.”


	
	Mr Angland was finally asked this:
	


“All right. I guess my question is, did your mount shift back to resume its position or was it your intention to shift back in?”


	
	Mr Angland said:
	


“There was no intention, you just get shot back on that corner and the next minute you know you’re back into normal racing pattern because you just get shot out for that one, two strides. Like every race you could nearly replay you could see that happen.”


	
	Nathan Cumberland was another jockey in the race. He was asked about the incident and said this:
	


“I don’t remember it too well, but I do remember I was outside Paul and it looked like his horse was over racing and he just got his head between Tye and whoever was inside Tye and I could see Paul trying to restrain and then he just went down. But where I was, it was nobody’s fault.”


	
	Mr Cumberland agreed that he was aware that Mr Goode “was obviously in a bad position”. He offered his comments on the video in these terms:
	


“It’s just a bad track and a big field and it was a bad start. There was a little bit of carnage at – like I said before, I think Paul’s horse got over racing. Tye’s horse might’ve drifted off a little bit, Paul’s horse kicked up in there and he had troubles bringing it back.”


	
	Mr Cumberland made a final comment to the inquiry when asked by the Chairman whether he was aware of Mr Angland, who was in front of him, “shifting off, getting into that 1000 metre turn”. He responded as follows:
	


“Not really, sir, no. All I was aware was when Paul was in trouble. I don’t know what – I wasn’t watching Tye or I can’t t remember where Tye was.”


	
	Brad Clark also gave evidence at the inquiry. His mount had been racing on the rail leading up to the fall. He said that “you do get shot off at [the] turn and that but I thought I was pretty much on the rail all the way around”. He said “I was giving myself a little bit of room on the rails” but said that he “didn’t think [he] shifted too far off the rails at all”. Some reference was made to Mr Clark having previously said that he was aware of Mr Angland shifting out leading up to the fall. He was asked how much room there was between him and Mr Angland:
	


“We weren’t racing overly tight. Like, I knew he was up to my outside because he was half a length in front of me, but, you know, we might have been giving each other a bit of room as well. Like, he might have been a quarter of a horse, half a horse off me at the time.”


	
	For completeness, the stewards’ inquiry came to the following conclusions:
	


“We find as follows: That leading up to the point, up to the 1100 metres, Shot of the Rails, Paul Goode’s mount, commences to over race and does continue to over race for some distance thereafter. Near the 1100 metres it is apparent that Port Gallery does not negotiate the turn and shifts out to a point where a run does present itself momentarily between Port Gallery and Dexter’s Angel for Shot of the Rails. Further, it’s apparent that at that stage, Shot of the Rails, while still over racing, improves into a position between those runners, whilst still under restraint from Paul Goode. A short distance after improving into that position, it is apparent that Shot of the Rails has insufficient racing room and falls as a consequence.

The stewards have given careful consideration to the circumstances which led to Shot of the Rails being left with insufficient racing room prior to the fall. After giving consideration to all that evidence, it is the opinion of the Stewards that Port Gallery, after failing to negotiate the turn near the 1100 metres, does shift back in and contributes to interference suffered by Shot of the Rails.

Tye Angland’s evidence is that there is a shift inwards from Port Gallery to reassume its racing position, after shifting out, but we would stress the absence of a direct head on or rear on view at the point leading up to the fall does not assist stewards in ascertaining the quantum of that shift. The available video evidence also does not assist stewards in determining whether there was any contribution from Dexter’s Angel in shifting out at any stage leading up to the fall.

In summation, the stewards are of the view that the fall of Shot of the Rails cannot be attributed to ride error. We are of the view that a contributing factor to the fall was Shot of the Rails’ inclination to over race resulting in the gelding improving into an awkward position between Dexter’s Angel and Port Gallery, running which, in the stewards’ opinion, was available momentarily due [to] the racing manners of Port Gallery which had shifted out. Again, whilst satisfied that Port Gallery does shift back in to reassume its position shortly after, we cannot be satisfied to the required standard that the fall can be attributed to any negligence on the part of Tye Angland, in particular, and his riding of Port Gallery at that stage.”

Mr Goode’s expert liability evidence

Brian Hilton Killian


	
	Mr Killian prepared a report for Mr Goode dated 11 September 2013. He had read the stewards’ report and watched the video of the race. With respect to the latter, Mr Killian commented as follows:
	


“(a) Camera shot one: it is clear to me that there is clear running (16:55:50.40) between Brad Clark’s mount and Tye Angland’s mount.

(b) Camera shot two: shows a lateral shot, before and after Paul Goode’s fall at the 1000 metres. Tye Angland’s mount has a big white blaze on its head and just before the fall (16:55:51.70) Tye Angland turns his horse’s head inwards and very shortly after Paul Goode falls. My observation of the DVD and reading evidence leaves me firmly of the opinion that Paul Goode was within his rights to take a comfortable run between Brad Clark and Tye Angland. During the inquiry Mr Angland admits to shifting back to normal racing.

…

I am of the belief that jockey Tye Angland has breached AR 137(a) (which covers careless riding) in Race 7 at Queanbeyan Racecourse on 29 June 2009.

…

It is very clear to me on the DVD that the first camera shot at 16:55:50.40 shows that there is clear and comfortable room for Paul Goode to position his mount inside of Tye Angland’s mount.

Mr Angland then shifts his mount inwards causing Paul Goode’s mount to be cramped and lose his rightful running.

Paul Goode’s horse then falls at 16:55:55.15.

In my opinion this action by Mr Angland constitutes ‘careless riding’ as contemplated by the Australian Rules of Racing. Mr Angland should never have shifted his mount in towards Mr Goode’s mount and in doing so he breached AR 137(a).

The second camera shot (a lateral shot) on the DVD shows Tye Angland’s mount, which has a very prominent white blaze on its head. This camera shot shows Tye Angland turn his mount’s head inwards at 16:55:51.70, then at 16:55:55.15 Paul Goode’s horse falls.

My observations are supported by evidence taken at the Stewards inquiry on 12 March 2010, Paul Goode, page 3, 130, ‘I did get tight and next minute I was on the ground’ also page 7, 340, Paul Goode, ‘There was a horse there’ (meaning rightful running)…After the running of the DVD, page 8, 360, Tye Angland states that there wasn’t a run on the inside for Paul Goode’s mount, but clearly on the DVD that is not the case (see at 16:55:50.40). Then on the same page, 390, Mr Angland states ‘I was shifting back’.”


	
	Mr Killian was cross-examined. He gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. A jockey advancing into a run knows that one or other of the horses ahead of his horse or both of them might shift laterally.

A. You don’t - if a jockey does that, he wouldn’t be riding in races. He wouldn’t earn a living if he rode up in between horses. To say that ‘I think that might shift or that might shift,’ there’s no way any jockey that’s riding in a race would go into a position saying ‘That’s going to shift. That’s going to shift,’ either that one or that one. He goes into it where there’s clear running. He goes into that clear running.

…

Q. You disagree with the proposition I just put to you.

A. Yes.”


	
	Mr Killian agreed with the suggestion that horses can shift laterally when galloping, whether or not the jockey riding the horse intends that movement to occur, although he emphasised that it was the jockey’s job to keep the horse straight. That was however not always possible.
	
	
	Mr Killian said that he did not observe Mr Goode’s horse stumble a few seconds before it fell. He said that if it did stumble, it was not sufficient for him to alter his opinion that the horse was going into clear running. He did agree that Mr Goode’s horse was over racing. Mr Killian said that Mr Goode’s horse was on the bit but was not unmanageable. It was his opinion that the horse was under control at the point when it fell as the following evidence reveals:
	


“Q. The opinions you’ve expressed are not on the basis that immediately before the fall, Mr Goode’s horse was over racing. Is that fair?

A. No, no, but just prior to the fall, the horse was under control, in my opinion. Back previously when Mr Goode was shifting out, the horse - he was having some difficulty but when the run come, he eased pressure he had on the horse to go into that run.”


	
	Mr Killian was asked about the “two horse” rule, which he accepted was an unwritten convention concerning when it was safe for a jockey to move a horse across the path of another horse. He said that when a jockey intentionally attempts to shift ground, the onus is on him to leave enough racing room for the front legs of the horse that is being crossed. Mr Killian said, “That’s the interpretation that’s taken all over the country”. He confirmed that his opinion, that Mr Angland was responsible for Mr Goode’s horse falling, proceeded on the basis that Mr Angland was intentionally steering his horse back towards the rails. In expressing that opinion, Mr Killian agreed that he interpreted what Mr Angland said at the stewards’ inquiry as an admission that he was intentionally moving his horse towards the rails.
	
	
	Mr Killian expanded on his opinion about the availability of clear running to Mr Goode in answer to a question on a different topic as follows:
	


“Q. You speak there of clear running but where in your report do you refer to Mr Angland shifting out to three or four horses from the rail?

A. I don’t think I do. All I say is there’s clear running quite - clear running at 55:51 as I made mention somewhere - or I made this after reading the report that Angland clearly states that there was carnage in front and he shifted out, giving himself room with the carnage up in front, which is the natural thing to do if there’s trouble in front of you. Angland is outside the other horse’s heels and if there is trouble he has got room to shift away and avoid any problems.

When it settled down, he turns his horse - that’s what I’m saying - at 55:51:80. It’s clear to me, looking at the video that he is safe; that there’s no carnage up in front. He turns the horse’s head back in. He comes in and when he comes back in, when the head is turned, there’s clearly - clearly; there’s no doubt in my mind that there’s space on the running lane with Clark.

There’s clear running with Mr Goode who is not actually up there at that time; he’s back. He’s back where the clear running is there, but then there’s clear running again and clear view between Angland and where Goode’s horse is when you’re looking at the rear view. My observation of it there is that when Angland turns the horse’s head, that clear, uninterrupted running, for Goode to go into that running, is there and there’s no doubting that in my mind.”


	
	Mr Killian had previously provided a very short opinion dated 8 October 2012. It was in the following terms:
	


“I believe that Tye Angland made the wrong decision to avoid trouble in front of him by turning his mount’s head inwards, causing Paul Goode’s mount to fall. The mention of interference was made on several occasions during [the stewards’ inquiry], he shifted to give himself more room. In the position Tye Angland was in, he could have done one of two things, shift out or shift in, he took the wrong option and shifted in and took Paul Goode’s rightfully [sic] running.”


	
	Mr Killian was asked questions about this opinion and specifically whether he would concede the possibility that Mr Angland’s horse moved in unintentionally, as opposed to having been steered there by its rider. His answer included the following:
	


“…I’ve had more experience with films, running films, reading films and I’ve got no doubt whatsoever in my mind - I repeat myself over and over again - that there wouldn’t have been any fall if Angland had held his ground and not come in. Nobody else’s heels could Mr Goode hit other than Angland who shifted back in, nobody. How many times you look at that video, you cannot blame anybody else for shifting and Mr Goode hitting Angland’s heels.”


	
	This opinion was effectively confirmed by Mr Killian in response to further cross-examination as follows:
	


“SEXTON: Mr Killian, as you have accepted, it’s a fair description of your evidence and your opinion that you are adamant that Mr Angland shifted across in front of Mr Goode?

A. My opinion is, and it’s the rules and the way we always interpret them, if he shifts across another horse’s running and does not leave room for their front legs, that constitutes carelessness.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Killian, I think the only question you were asked was whether or not it was your opinion that Mr Angland shifted across?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree or not?

A. Yes.

SEXTON: In your opinion that’s absolutely clear from the videos that you have seen?

A. It’s clear to me.”


	
	In elaboration of this, Mr Killian was taken to exhibit “AC” on page 19 and answered in these terms:
	


“A. At the rear of the field you’ve got a jockey, Clark, Mr Clark, he is at least half a horse off the fence. There’s clearance between Clark and Mr Goode, and Mr Goode at this point is back. He’s not up inside of Mr Angland’s heels. After this - and that’s when there’s plenty of room - Mr Angland comes back and you’ll see him when Mr Goode’s tail goes up at page 24 [quaere, 34] and he’s going down, he’s a very tight three horses wide. So he’s shifted from the best part of four deep, he’s about three and a half horses off the fence, nearly four, and when it comes to Mr Goode sitting up and trying to get out of trouble, he’s a tight three horses. So he’s shifted the best part of a full horse to come in and bring Mr Goode to grief.

SEXTON: So the answer to the question I asked before is that you would say he has come in a full-horse width?

A. Almost a full-horse width.

Q. Would you describe almost a full-horse width as being a touch?

A. I don’t understand your question.

Q. If somebody said to you that a jockey had shifted in a touch, would that suggest to you a full-horse width?

A. No, no.

Q. A touch suggests something much less than a full-horse width, doesn’t it?

A. Far less, yes.”


	
	Mr Killian was extensively cross-examined by Mr Sexton SC about exhibit “AC” and specifically about the difference in time between when he said there was a clear run available to Mr Goode and when he considered Mr Angland deliberately started shifting in. After securing Mr Killian’s agreement about the distance that a racehorse was likely to travel at full gallop in a specified time, Mr Sexton asked the following questions:
	


“Q. So if a horse at full gallop is covering 25 metres, it will take three to four strides to do so. Do you agree with that?

A. I suppose so, yes. It would be somewhere around about it.

Q. Because if this gap was only available for three to four strides, then the gap would only be available for 25 to 30 metres. Do you agree with that?

A. 30 metres, yes. At least 30 metres.

Q. And the gap that you’ve identified from the photos and the point at which you’ve identified Mr Angland was deliberately shifting his horse in are about 25 to 30 metres apart, aren’t they?

A. About 30 metres apart, good 30 metres; good 30 metres, yes.”


	
	Mr Killian then gave this evidence:
	


“Q. Horses are capable, if another horse gets in front of them, of avoiding contact. That’s right, isn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. They don’t need a jockey to do that for them, do they?

A. No, but that could not be determined in one statement. No, that - horses will run up on to another horse’s heels if the jockey’s not there to stop them.

Q. They’re more likely to run up on to another horse’s heels if they’re over racing, aren’t they?

A. It’s possible, yes.

Q. Because over racing means that something has caused the horse to be unsettled.

A. They’re racing - they’re racing that they want to go faster, let’s put it that way, and they’re being restrained. They’ve got to be restrained. The jockey was restraining the horse in this instance.”


	
	Mr Killian also agreed that the pictures at pages 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 of exhibit “AC”, which showed Mr Goode standing upright in the saddle compared to the other jockeys, were consistent with a jockey attempting to restrain a horse that is over racing.
	


James William Williams


	
	Mr Williams provided two reports dated 18 October 2013 and 14 July 2015 respectively. Under the heading “Overall Opinion” in his first report, Mr Williams said this:
	


“It is my opinion that when Mr Angland shifted out he allowed clear running for Mr Goode’s mount…to safely take up a position to the inside of Mr Angland’s mount…and to the outside of Mr Clark’s mount…

Shortly after that run is presented then Mr Goode’s mount moves up to the inside of Mr Angland and is there for at least 4 strides. Mr Angland then turns his horse’s head inwards and steers his mount in.

The action of shifting in results in Mr Goode’s mount clipping the heels of Mr Angland’s mount and falling.

There is an established practice that two lengths constitutes a safe margin when a rider attempts to shift ground. In my experience as a steward it was acknowledged by the industry that two lengths is a safe distance for horses in full gallop to cross each other without the probability of the horses clipping heels or being interfered with.

…

It is my opinion that Mr Angland had the responsibility to know Mr Goode’s mount was to his inside and shifting out presented a run to Mr Goode that he would be enticed to take up that position. The onus falls on the rider who is shifting ground to be aware at all times where other riders are prior to shifting ground.

Mr Angland by steering his horse in should have known that this action would result in the clear running that was presented to Mr Goode would therefore be taken by Mr Angland’s mount. Due to Mr Angland’s race riding experience he would be familiar with racing patterns and the likelihood of horses taking up runs when they present themselves.

In my opinion, Mr Angland did not comply with the two length practice as his mount was not two lengths clear of Mr Goode’s mount when he shifted ground inwards. It is obvious from my observations of the film that Mr Angland was not sufficiently clear when he shifted ground due to Mr Goode’s mount clipping the heels of Mr Angland’s mount and falling.”


	
	Mr Williams was cross-examined. He confirmed his understanding, taken from the video, that Mr Angland’s horse shifted out more than one horse and later shifted back in more than one horse. He disagreed with the proposition that horses do not run in an absolutely straight line. However, he agreed that a horse could run in a straight line even though its head may be turned to the side. He also agreed that from his experience the lateral movement of a horse can occur whether or not the jockey riding the horse intends that movement to occur. Part of a jockey’s job was to keep the horse running straight but it was not always possible to do so. Mr Williams agreed that Mr Goode’s horse stumbled but he did not mention it in his report as he did not consider that it was connected to the fall. He agreed that the stumble could have been caused by the horse over racing.
	
	
	Mr Williams was asked about the shifts by Mr Angland’s horse as follows:
	


“Q. So your interpretation of the moving video footage and of these stills is that Mr Angland’s horse shifts out from this point in time?

A. Yes.

Q. Or has shifted out.

A. Has shifted out, yes.

Q. It is your opinion that later Mr Angland shifts back in?

A. Yes.

Q. In 2.2 do we understand the middle paragraph to mean that Mr Angland shifts out one horse or that he shifts out something less than that or more than that?

A. I’d say he shifts out more than that. I’ve said he leaves room for a horse.

Q. I understand that. I’m just trying to understand what we should take your opinion to be as to how far he has shifted out.

A. I would say more than one horse.

Q. And is it your opinion also that when Mr Angland subsequently shifts in, he shifts in more than one horse?

A. Yes.

Q. How much more than one horse?

A. Probably a horse and a half, maybe two horses.”


	
	Mr Williams was taken to page four of his second report where he said, by reference to a Home Turn screen shot at 16:55:50.90, that Mr Angland’s horse shifts out and leaves room for one horse to his inside and to the outside of Mr Clark’s horse. His cross-examination on that topic was in the following terms:
	


“Q. Just following that comment, Mr Williams, would you go to page 4 of your second report, image 2. Is that a still shot?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you base your opinion on that still shot?

A. Yes.

Q. Going back to what you said in your first report, you say, ‘The gap is open for at least four strides before Port Gallery then shifts back in.’ Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. Four strides is a distance of about 28 metres, isn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. The photo at page 17 in exhibit AC, which is the same photo as your image 2, is taken more than 100 metres before the point of the fall, isn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. It follows, doesn’t it, that the gap was closed long before Mr Goode’s horse improved up to the back of Mr Angland’s horse.”


	
	An objection to that question, based upon the proposition that it had never been put to Mr Goode that the gap had closed, interrupted Mr Williams’ attempt to answer it. The objection was later withdrawn. The question remained unanswered. However, Mr Williams was asked some further questions as follows:
	


“Q. Mr Williams, your overall opinion, the second paragraph, is to say shortly after that run is presented - and by ‘shortly after that run is presented’ you’re referring to what you say in the first paragraph under Overall Opinion, aren’t you?

A. Yes.

Q. You then say that Mr Goode’s mount moves up to the inside of Mr Angland and is there for at least four strides. You then say Mr Angland then turns his horse’s head inwards and steers his mount in. Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. But the two photos that you’ve identified - that is the gap and Mr Angland turning his horse’s head inwards - occur at the same time, don’t they?

A. Yes.

Q. What I’m putting to you is that the photos that you have relied on do not support your opinion that Mr Angland shifting in caused the fall more than 100 metres later.

A. Can I just clarify? Are you saying - because page 36 that you’ve identified as the fall - I mean, the gap is closed long before that.

Q. Well, if the gap’s closed long before that--

A. I mean, that horse was--

Q. Excuse me. Just wait for the question. If the gap has closed long before that, why isn’t Mr Goode keeping his horse back from the non-existent gap?

…

Q. Can you answer that question, Mr Williams?

A. What was the question, sorry?

Q. You said a moment ago words to the effect that the gap had closed long before the fall. Do you remember saying that?

A. Well, the gap that Tye Angland had moved in. I mean, that - what I’m trying to say is that shot that you took me to is the fall. Like it’s not the start of the fall. The start of the fall happens before that.

Q. How much before that?

A. Well, I mean, I’d have to go through but--

Q. Please do, Mr Williams.

A. Well, looking at those shots, I mean, I’d probably suggest 31 is where he - where Paul Goode is in trouble, I suppose.”


	
	Mr Williams was referring to screenshot 31 in exhibit “AC”. Mr Williams was then cross-examined as follows:
	


“Q. If it was the fact that his horse was over racing till immediately before the fall, then it would be over racing in the photo at page 31 of exhibit AC, so he wouldn’t--

A. If you’re saying to me is he taking hold because his horse is over racing, I would say no. I would say he’s taking hold because he’s about to clip heels.

Q. The reason he’s about to clip heels is at least in part because his horse has been coming forward relative to Mr Angland’s horse, isn’t it?

A. I would say that he’s in a run. I wouldn’t say he was coming forward as Mr Angland’s horse - I would say that he was inside - he was in a - he had taken a run to the inside of Mr Angland’s horse.

Q. Can you identify by reference to these photos the point at which Mr Angland’s horse crosses in front of Mr Goode’s horse, so as to constitute interference in your experience as a steward?

A. I’d probably 29, he’s crossing him, 28, 29.”


	
	Mr Williams gave the following evidence when his cross-examination continued on the next day:
	


“Q. So I understand your evidence, Mr Williams, is it your opinion that the gap which you identify at 16:55:50.81 which is the photograph on page 17 of exhibit AC did not close until the moment of the fall?

A. No. It was gradually closing as Tye Angland was shifting in.

Q. At what point do you say that the gap had closed so that Mr Goode could no longer safety intrude into it?

A. The gap really doesn’t close. Tye Angland shifts in front of Paul Goode and then Paul Goode clips his heels and falls. If you’re talking about the gap between Tye Angland and Brad Clark, that probably closes after the horse is on the ground.

Q. Is it your opinion, based on your interpretation of the film and the photographs that Mr Goode’s horse did not shift any further away from the rail between the photographs shown on page 17 of AC and the time of the fall?

A. No, I don’t believe it does.

Q. Following that through, Mr Clark’s horse shifts out; Mr Goode’s horse stays at the same distance away from the rails and Mr Angland’s horse shifts in one and a half to two horses, as you said yesterday. Is that your considered opinion?

A. Brad Clark’s horse barely shifts, if at all.

Q. Is it your considered opinion that Mr Goode’s horse does not shift at all off the rails?

A. No, I don’t believe - looking at those shots.

Q. It is your considered opinion that Mr Angland’s horse shifts in one and a half to two horses.

A. Yes.”


	
	Mr Williams said that a racehorse could run a furlong in 12 seconds. He then said that that was roughly the equivalent of 100 metres in six seconds.
	


Mr Angland’s expert liability evidence

John Matthew Schreck


	
	Mr Schreck provided a report dated 13 August 2015. That report was initially marked as exhibit “2”. Mr Schreck adhered to that report with one reservation, which he described in the following terms:
	


“In the report I submitted to the solicitors I didn’t have the advantage of seeing the still shots that had been done and I said that I thought that Jockey Goode got on to the heels of Angland and fell. I’m not 100% certain of that any more. It seems to me, looking at some of these other shots that the move of the horse from the inside - he wouldn’t get the heels but there’s a chance that his legs got tangled up with Dexter’s Angel. So I’m not prepared to say that it was Angland or the other horse that was responsible for the fall.”


	
	However, a late objection to the whole of Mr Schreck’s report, including his later amended opinion, was taken by Mr Bartley SC on behalf of Mr Goode. I upheld that objection and rejected the report. I have therefore entirely disregarded it for the purposes of these reasons.
	


William James Burnett


	
	Mr Burnett prepared a report dated 4 August 2015. He is a retired jockey with over 5,800 rides to his credit. His opinion may be summarised as follows.
	
	
	After the jump, Mr Goode decided to cross behind the field and move towards the inside rail. He urged his mount along for a short time and then took hold of the horse. As soon as he did so, the horse began to over race. Mr Goode then tried to settle his mount, but the horse did not respond and continued to over race. As Mr Goode’s horse approached the first turn at 16:55:51.07 it stumbled. There does not appear to be any reason for this and the stumble is not caused by any other runner. Importantly, following the stumble, Mr Goode stood in the stirrups trying to regain control of his horse. Mr Burnett thought that Mr Goode experienced great difficulty in doing so. The horse then shifted to its left putting it what Mr Burnett describes as “too close” to Mr Angland’s horse, with which he then came into contact and fell. Mr Burnett did not agree that Mr Angland’s horse shifted to the right, allowing for the fact that there may have been some slight movement as the horses negotiated what appeared to be a very difficult turn. Mr Burnett said that he was in no doubt that the significant movement prior to and during the fall came from Mr Goode’s horse and not from Mr Angland’s horse. In his opinion, the fall was not caused by Mr Angland. The stumble experienced by Mr Goode’s horse played “a major role” in the fall. Mr Goode’s horse moved out shortly before the fall, giving the false impression that Mr Angland moved in.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Burnett agreed that there was always room for Mr Goode to move inside Mr Angland. He agreed that the stumble occurred about three seconds before the fall. He also agreed that Mr Killian has for many years been regarded as one of the most skilful readers of a race in Australia. However, Mr Burnett, who was himself born in 1944, was not prepared to accept Mr Killian’s opinion in this case, as the following passages of evidence tend to reveal:
	


“Q. I appreciate that you only had his report when you wrote your report but having heard him in the witness box and having heard him cross examined and challenged, would you not accept that Mr Killian’s account of what happened in this race is to be preferred to your account?

A. Can I be totally honest here?

Q. Yes?

A. I was shocked and disappointed at listening to Mr Killian’s evidence. From a man of his experience, I was quite surprised and I can only say that I would put it down to his age.”


	
	Mr Burnett later gave this evidence:
	


“BARTLEY: You put the fall down to the stumble.

A. No. I put the fall down to the fact that at no stage in the race in my opinion was Mr Goode in total control of Shot of the Rails and that was exacerbated by the stumble. If you look at the film clearly, you will see that throughout the race because he is trying to control his mount Mr Goode is continually moving to his left and actually towards Port Gallery and eventually he ends up on Port Gallery’s heels. It is also my opinion that once Angland got behind Predicate, he maintained the same distance from the inside running rail right throughout to the fall.

HIS HONOUR: So in summary your opinion is that there was always room for a horse to--

A. Between--

Q. Hold on.

A. Sorry.

Q. There was always room for Mr Goode to advance as he said but his horse drifted out and into the path of Mr Angland who continued to hold his line.

A. Correct.”


	
	In summary, Mr Burnett was of the view that Mr Goode drifted out left and onto the heels of Mr Angland’s horse, not the other way round. Mr Goode was unable to control his mount because it was over racing.
	


Submissions

Mr Goode


	
	In his detailed and helpful written submissions, Mr Goode contended that I should make the following findings of fact:
	



	
	At about the 1100 metre mark, Mr Angland’s horse shifted out about one and a half to two horses to its left away from the rails.
	
	
	The shift was partly because of the way Mr Angland negotiated the bend.
	
	
	The shift to the left was partly caused by Mr Angland steering his horse to the left to avoid “carnage” up ahead.
	
	
	In shifting to the left, Mr Angland created a gap of at least “a good horse” into which Mr Goode had legitimate running.
	
	
	Mr Goode improved his horse’s position into the running created by Mr Angland shifting to his left between Mr Angland’s horse and Mr Clark’s horse.
	
	
	At the bend, Mr Angland steered his horse inwards towards the rails and over approximately the next 100 metres he closed the gap between his horse and Mr Clark’s horse, taking Mr Goode’s rightful running.
	
	
	At about the 1000 metre mark, Mr Goode’s horse’s front hooves clipped the rear heels of Mr Angland’s horse causing it to fall.
	
	
	Prior to Mr Angland steering his horse back towards the rails, he did not look over his shoulder.
	
	
	When Mr Angland steered his horse back towards the rails, he was approximately one length in front of Mr Goode’s horse.
	
	
	In steering his horse towards the rails when he was only one length from Mr Goode’s horse, Mr Angland breached the “two lengths” rule.
	
	
	By steering his horse towards the rails, when he was not sufficiently clear of Mr Goode, Mr Angland breached his duty of care.
	



	
	In summary, Mr Goode alleges that Mr Angland breached his duty of care owed to him by shifting inwards across Mr Goode’s clear and rightful running contrary to the “two lengths” rule.
	
	
	Mr Goode submitted that the video evidence, with particular reference to its interpretation provided by the expert witnesses, supported his contentions in the following ways.
	
	
	First, Mr Killian’s analysis of the race was that Mr Angland had deliberately shifted out to avoid what he described as carnage up ahead, and when trouble did not eventuate, he turned his horse’s head in, shifted in carelessly, without leaving sufficient room for Mr Goode’s horse’s front legs, causing that horse to fall. He estimated that the inward shift by Mr Angland was “the best part of a full horse to come in and bring Mr Goode to grief”. Mr Killian did not think that Mr Goode was over racing immediately before the fall but that the over racing had occurred about fifty metres beforehand. He said Mr Goode’s horse was “under control” just prior to the fall. Mr Killian thought that Mr Angland’s decisions in shifting out and then back in leaving insufficient room for Mr Goode’s horse amounted to careless riding.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Williams considered that Mr Angland’s horse shifted out near the 1000 metre mark leaving room for one horse on his inside and to the outside of Mr Clark’s horse. That allowed clear running for Mr Goode’s horse safely to take up a position between them. Mr Goode’s horse moved up on the inside of Mr Angland’s horse before Mr Angland turned his horse’s head inwards and steered in towards the rails. That action caused Mr Goode’s horse to clip the heels of Mr Angland’s horse causing the fall. Mr Angland should have allowed at least two lengths before doing so. It was Mr Angland’s responsibility to know that Mr Goode’s horse was on his inside and that by shifting out he would present a run that Mr Goode would be enticed to take. He estimated that Mr Goode had been in the gap between Mr Angland’s horse and Mr Clark’s horse for approximately six seconds or roughly 100 metres before the fall. Mr Williams estimated the outward shift by Mr Angland’s horse to have been more than one horse and the inward shift as being probably a horse and a half and possibly two. He accepted that Mr Clark’s horse may have shifted slightly at the time of the fall but not significantly. He said that when the gap opened, it remained open for at least four strides before Mr Angland shifted in. The stumble by Mr Goode’s horse was of no relevance or significance.
	
	
	Thirdly, and by way of contrast, Mr Burnett said the fall was caused by Mr Clark and Mr Goode each moving out to meet Mr Angland. Despite Mr Angland’s own evidence, Mr Burnett did not think that he shifted back in. That opinion fell foul of the evidence of the jockeys in the race, none of whom suggested that Mr Goode shifted out. Nor did the stewards make any mention of Mr Goode’s horse moving away from the rails at any time leading up to the fall. Mr Goode submitted that an acceptance of Mr Burnett’s opinion that Mr Angland’s horse did not shift inwards would require a rejection of what is clearly shown on the video and Mr Angland’s own evidence both to the stewards’ inquiry and in this Court that he did move back in. Mr Goode contended that Mr Burnett’s opinion appeared to be based upon the video showing Mr Angland following Mr Geppert and the related assumption that Mr Geppert did not alter his line. That opinion does not take account of the fact that Mr Geppert was several lengths ahead of Mr Goode and further into the bend, giving the false appearance that Mr Angland was behind him. Mr Goode also submitted that Mr Burnett’s opinion ignored Mr Angland’s “clear evidence” that Mr Geppert was in a group of horses that were riding “erratically” and that while he was in a line with Mr Geppert at one point, he did not follow him.
	
	
	Mr Goode referred to Mr Angland’s evidence in which he admitted that his horse shifted out at the turn where the fall occurred and that he had shifted away from the rails to give himself a bit of extra room because of the carnage involving Mr Geppert. Mr Goode submitted that Mr Angland’s account, that his movement out and then back took place in a “split second” or in “one or two strides”, was “implausible”. Mr Angland had acknowledged that it was standard practice for a jockey to look over his shoulder when shifting ground.
	
	
	Mr Goode also emphasised that Mr Angland agreed that the photographs showed his horse shifting out on the turn, that Mr Goode got his horse’s nose into the gap between Mr Angland’s horse and Mr Clark’s horse after Mr Angland shifted out and that the gap was at least at one stage a “comfortable horse”.
	
	
	Finally Mr Goode emphasised that Mr Angland accepted that if photograph 15 of exhibit “Z” showed his arm was back and the white blaze of his horse was pointed towards the rails it would indicate that he was attempting to steer his horse towards the rails. Mr Angland did not however accept that the photograph depicted that assumption.
	


Mr Angland


	
	Section 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides as follows:
	


“5B General principles

(1)    A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:

(a)    the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and

(b)    the risk was not insignificant, and

(c)    in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person’s position would have taken those precautions.

(2)   In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):

(a)    the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,

(b)    the likely seriousness of the harm,

(c)    the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,

(d)    the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.”


	
	Mr Angland uncontroversially conceded that the relevant risk in this case was both foreseeable and not insignificant. Acknowledging that the “precaution” issue could be expressed in a number of different ways, Mr Angland accepted that the factual question was whether Mr Goode could establish that Mr Angland rode his horse in an unreasonable manner in all of the circumstances. That was the relevant risk of harm.
	
	
	Mr Angland emphasised that Mr Goode was required to discharge his onus of proof, having regard to the whole of the evidence. He stressed that it was not simply a matter of Mr Goode asserting that he “saw Tye’s horse shift back to its right closing the gap”. Furthermore, Mr Angland submitted that Mr Goode was required to do more, in the proof of his case, than merely establish on the balance of probabilities that Mr Angland’s horse moved laterally some distance at some stage. Mr Angland submitted that Mr Goode had to prove that Mr Angland’s horse moved an unreasonable distance laterally and that Mr Goode was thereby deprived of a reasonable opportunity to adjust his own horse’s position in response. In that respect, Mr Angland submitted that at no time was the nose of Mr Goode’s horse ahead of the tail of Mr Angland’s horse. Accordingly, all references in the evidence to Mr Goode’s horse “advancing into a run” or “improving into a run” or of “being between Mr Clark’s horse and Mr Angland’s horse” had to be understood as meaning that Mr Goode’s horse was advancing on a line between Mr Angland’s horse and Mr Clark’s horse when viewed from behind, but that Mr Goode’s horse was never at any time actually between those horses.
	
	
	Sporting competitors, including jockeys, owe each other a duty of reasonable care that does not require proof of actual intention by a defendant to cause harm to a plaintiff: Johnston v Frazer (1990) 21 NSWLR 89 at 91E, 94C-G. In addition, there is no doubt that the rules of sport “are neither definitive of the existence nor of the extent of the duty; nor does their breach or non-observance necessarily constitute a breach of any duty found to exist”: Rootes v Shelton [1967] HCA 39; (1967) 116 CLR 383 at 389:
	


“But the issue on either view is whether the defendant’s act or omission was a breach of a duty of care which he owed to the plaintiff; and accordingly in a case such as the present it must always be a question of fact, what exoneration from a duty of care otherwise incumbent upon the defendant was implied by the act of the plaintiff in joining in the activity. Unless the activity partakes of the nature of a war or of something else in which all is notoriously fair, the conclusion to be reached must necessarily depend, according to the concepts of the common law, upon the reasonableness, in relation to the special circumstances, of the conduct which caused the plaintiff’s injury. That does not necessarily mean the compliance of that conduct with the rules, conventions or customs (if there are any) by which the correctness of conduct for the purpose of the carrying on of the activity as an organized affair is judged; for the tribunal of fact may think that in the situation in which the plaintiff’s injury was caused a participant might do what the defendant did and still not be acting unreasonably, even though he infringed the ""rules of the game"" Non-compliance with such rules, conventions or customs (where they exist) is necessarily one consideration to be attended to upon the question of reasonableness; but it is only one, and it may be of much or little or even no weight in the circumstances.”


	
	With respect to the so-called “two lengths” rule, Mr Angland submitted that it was no more than a guideline or rule of thumb to which strict adherence was not inevitably required: depending upon the circumstances, something less than two lengths may not be consistent only with negligence. Moreover, the “rule” was directed to intentional lateral movements of a horse by its rider. Whilst clearly not determinative of breach in tort, that understanding is nevertheless a relevant consideration in determining whether a jockey’s conduct was unreasonable in terms of the law of negligence.
	
	
	Mr Angland submitted that consideration and determination of questions of scope of duty and breach of duty may tend to overlap in sporting injury cases, particularly in those sports that are inherently dangerous. However, whether expressed in terms of the scope of the duty of care owed by one jockey to another during a professional horserace or in terms of the standard of reasonableness relevant to breach by the same jockey, relevant circumstances, apart from the written rules and unwritten practices of horseracing, are first, the nature of horse riding in any context and secondly, the nature of the contest in the sport of horseracing.
	
	
	With respect to the former, Dankwerts LJ said in Wooldridge v Sumner [1963] 2 QB 43 at 59:
	


“I would…like to emphasise that a horse is not a reliable mechanical contrivance, compelled to answer the directions which may be conveyed to it…the horse has its own natural mind and impulses, and is the unpredictable partner in the combination of horse and rider.”


	
	With respect to the latter, Chesterman J observed in Kliese v Pelling [1998] QSC 112 at 12:
	


“…the court ought not to be too delicate in its assessment of the defendant’s conduct which is said to have been negligent. Thoroughbred horseracing is a competitive business which is played for high stakes. Its participants are large animals ridden by small men at high speed in close proximity. The opportunity for injury is abundant and the choices available to jockeys to avoid or reduce risk are limited. It is, no doubt, for these reasons that claims for damages arising out of horse races have been rare and are likely to remain so.”


	
	Similar references are to be found in Appo v Stanley [2010] QSC 383. In that case the court noted that it is necessary to bring to account the fact that jockeys are engaged in sport, that that sport has inherent risks, and that they are obliged to use their best endeavours to win.
	
	
	Mr Angland contended that these were factors that raised the distinction between errors of judgment and negligent conduct: see Caldwell v Maguire [2001] EWCA (Civ) 1054. In that case, a scope of duty requiring reckless disregard for the plaintiff’s safety was rejected in favour of a duty to exercise such degree of care as was appropriate in all of the circumstances. However, the plaintiff’s claim was rejected even though the defendant was found by the stewards to be guilty of careless riding. That was because something more is required for liability in negligence than “errors of judgment, oversights or lapses of which any participant might be guilty in the context of a fast-moving contest” and that “it is not possible to characterise momentary carelessness as negligence”: at [25]-[37].
	
	
	In Wooldridge v Sumner, Diplock LJ said at 68:
	


“…if in the course of the game or competition, at a moment when he really has not time to think, a participant by mistake takes a wrong measure, he is not, in my view, to be held guilty of any negligence.”


	
	Mr Angland contended that both Mr Killian and Mr Williams approach the question of his liability by attempting to demonstrate that at particular, although different, points in the race, he deliberately steered his horse towards the rail, not that he carelessly permitted his horse to shift one way and then the other or that (as in the rejected claim in Caldwell v Maguire) he failed to look behind so as to avoid Mr Goode’s over racing horse. Both Mr Killian and Mr Williams emphasised the “two lengths” rule in the context of intentional conduct. However, Mr Angland argued as follows:
	


“The point is not to suggest that intention or recklessness is a necessary ingredient for a finding of negligence against a jockey but to emphasise at the outset of the factual inquiry that in the particular circumstances of this incident both of the plaintiff’s experts regarded it important to establish that there was a deliberate shift by the defendant, implicitly because, in the absence of intentional steering of the horse, what can be seen on the video in the hundred metres or so before the fall was simply part and parcel of highly competitive horseracing.”


	
	The distinction between negligent acts or omissions and errors of judgment remains part of the common law of Australia. In Woods v Multi-Sport Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 9; (2002) 208 CLR 460 at [16], Gleeson CJ remarked upon the difference between “an error of judgment and a failure to take reasonable care”.
	
	
	Finally, it is trite to observe that no duty, including the duty owed by a jockey in a professional horserace, requires the elimination of risk or the prevention of foreseeable harm: Moloughney v Wellington Racing Club [1935] NZLR 800 at 806; Grassi v Brandt (1986) Aust Torts Reports 80-010 at 67,565; Roads and Traffic Authority v Dederer (2007) 238 ALR 761 at [18]; [51]-[52]; [278]; Leichhardt Municipal Council v Montgomery [2007] HCA 6; (2007) 230 CLR 22 at [26]. In Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4; (2005) 220 CLR 517 at [4]-[5], Gleeson CJ said this:
	


“[4] In an action framed in negligence, the judge (if necessary) will decide, as a matter of law, whether the facts alleged by the plaintiff are capable of giving rise to a duty of care in the defendant towards the plaintiff. A legal issue of that kind is often capable of being decided on the pleadings. On the other hand, the alleged duty of care might depend upon contested facts that need to be resolved as part of the trial process. In order to be entitled to a verdict, the plaintiff will need to establish a duty of care, conduct on the part of the defendant in breach of that duty (negligent conduct), and consequential damage.

[5] In legal formulations of the duty and standard of care, the central concept is reasonableness. The duty is usually expressed in terms of protecting another against unreasonable risk of harm, or of some kind of harm; the standard of conduct necessary to discharge the duty is usually expressed in terms of what would be expected of a reasonable person, both as to foresight of the possibility of harm, and as to taking precautions against such harm. Life is risky. People do not expect, and are not entitled to expect, to live in a risk-free environment. The measure of careful behaviour is reasonableness, not elimination of risk. Where people are subject to a duty of care, they are to some extent their neighbours’ keepers, but they are not their neighbours’ insurers.”


	
	Mr Angland submitted that Mr Goode’s claim must fail.
	


Consideration and findings


	
	One aspect of Mr Goode’s case that is capable of discrete disposition is his claim that he called out to Mr Angland at the time of the fall or shortly beforehand. As earlier recorded, Mr Goode said in his statement of evidence dated 5 October 2015 that he shouted “Tye!”. In the course of his oral evidence before me, Mr Goode said that he shouted instead “Fuck, Tye!”.
	
	
	Although in my view the questions of whether or not Mr Goode called out to Mr Angland at all, or the terms of precisely what he called out if he did, are beside the point of Mr Angland’s liability in these proceedings, I am not satisfied that Mr Goode called out to Mr Angland at all. First, Mr Goode never raised this suggestion at the stewards’ inquiry, when he might have been expected to do so. Secondly, although there are well known limitations upon deciding such a question upon the basis of a witness’s demeanour, I was left with the very distinct impression that Mr Goode was himself only faintly wedded to the strength of either version of his evidence about this. Thirdly, even though it was in Mr Angland’s interest to deny it, I found his denial convincing. As I have indicated, however, it is my view that the question of whether or not Mr Goode called out to Mr Angland is of no assistance to me in resolving the difficult and significant factual issues at large in this case.
	
	
	I have found the video and screenshots taken of the race to be very helpful and instructive. I have taken the opportunity to view the video repeatedly on several different occasions. I have correspondingly examined the screenshots and assessed the experts’ opinions that refer specifically to various aspects of this evidence. I am not an expert in assessing or analysing what such video material or still photographs is said to reveal about a professional horserace. I have, however, utilised and referred to the photographic material in detail as an aid to understanding what the respective experts say that it demonstrates.
	
	
	Mr Goode’s case in summary is that Mr Angland took his running when it was unsafe to do so. Mr Goode says that Mr Angland steered or permitted his horse to come across his line, inwards towards the rails. Mr Goode contends that he was maintaining his line and was improving into a gap a good horse wide. He should have been permitted to continue on that line but was brought down when his horse’s front legs clipped the heels of Mr Angland’s horse as it moved across. That would not have occurred if Mr Angland had maintained his line. It is implicit in Mr Goode’s argument that Mr Angland veered in this way, if not suddenly or unexpectedly, at least so that Mr Goode had no reasonable opportunity or ability to avoid the collision. That argument must necessarily include the proposition that Mr Angland’s lateral movement back in towards the rails was unreasonable both because of the extent of the movement and because of the timing of that movement, including in that last respect precisely when it occurred and how long it took when it did.
	
	
	In my opinion, the fall occurred in the following way. First, it is patently clear from the video of the race, particularly the Home Turn camera angle, that any gap between Mr Angland’s horse and Mr Clark’s horse into which Mr Goode was seeking to improve does not close suddenly or even quickly. On the contrary, that gap appears to close over quite some distance, measurable from its start at approximately 16:55:49.79 or so until the fall commencing at about 16:55:53.80. Indeed, Mr Williams, who gave expert evidence for Mr Goode, made it clear that it was not his opinion that the gap did not close until the moment of the fall. Instead, he described the gap closing “gradually” as Mr Angland was shifting in. That can be quite instructively contrasted with Mr Angland’s horse rolling out away from the rails commencing at 16:55:50.41, which coincidentally serves to widen the gap for Mr Goode, but which clearly happens relatively quickly. Mr Williams’ opinion that the gap “was gradually closing as Tye Angland was shifting in” accords entirely with the view I have independently formed from viewing the video of the race.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Williams expressed the opinion that the gap between Mr Clark and Mr Angland did not close so that Mr Goode could no longer safely “intrude” into it. Mr Williams said “the gap really doesn’t close”. He said “Tye Angland shifts in front of Paul Goode and then Paul Goode clips his heels and falls”. It would seem to be Mr Williams’ opinion that the gap does not close even though Mr Angland’s horse “shifts in one and a half to two horses”. As Mr Williams said, “If you’re talking about the gap between Tye Angland and Brad Clark, that probably closes after the horse is on the ground”. Mr Williams’ opinion that the gap between Mr Clark and Mr Angland does not really close also accords entirely with the view I have independently formed from viewing the video of the race. Moreover, Mr Williams’ evidence concerning the lateral distance of between one and a half and two horses that Mr Angland’s horse shifts back in must also have occurred gradually, in accordance with his previous evidence to that effect. My own view of the video of the race leads me to form exactly the same opinion. The fact that the horses are all taking the turn gives the potentially misleading impression, when viewed from a stationary camera at the rear of the field, that all horses, including Mr Angland’s horse, are moving in towards the rails. I also prefer Mr Burnett’s opinion that “once [Mr] Angland got behind Predicate, he maintained the same distance from the inside running rail right throughout to the fall”.
	
	
	In this same context I am unable to accept Mr Killian’s opinion that it is “clear” that Mr Angland’s horse shifts back in or that it happened intentionally. Mr Angland never agreed that his arm was back, indicating that he was pulling on the right rein. I have in any event some considerable difficulty accepting that Mr Killian could say that at 16:55:51.80 it is clear that Mr Angland is turning his horse’s head in towards the rails. In my opinion, Mr Angland’s horse on the contrary appears to hold its line, as Mr Burnett insisted, and that the gap into which Mr Goode proposed or hoped to improve closed gradually, as accepted by Mr Williams.
	
	
	Thirdly, by way of confirmation of the view I have formed, Mr Angland’s horse appears to be well separated from Mr Clark’s horse in the fractions of a second following the fall. For example, this can be seen at 16:55:54.79. Before the fall, Mr Goode’s horse obscures this gap. However, at the point when Mr Goode’s horse goes down, there is then revealed what appears to be a gap of sufficient width into which Mr Goode’s horse could have continued safely to improve but for the fall.
	
	
	Fourthly, at no time does the nose of Mr Goode’s horse get ahead of the tail of Mr Angland’s horse. This is best understood by reference to the Lateral View video and screenshots. I agree with submissions made on Mr Angland’s behalf that all references in the evidence to Mr Goode’s horse advancing or improving into a run or to being between Mr Clark’s horse and Mr Angland’s horse have to be understood as meaning that Mr Goode’s horse was advancing on a line directed to taking up a position between those horses but that it never actually succeeded in attaining or reaching a position between them.
	
	
	Fifthly, throughout the gradual process of the gap closing between Mr Clark and Mr Angland, Mr Goode’s horse was over racing. He was as a result gaining ground on Mr Angland. Several references appear in the transcript to Mr Goode’s horse “improving”. This can be seen from the Lateral View screenshots and video between 16:55:51.63 and the fall. I find as a fact that Mr Goode was not able, despite his attempts and without fault on his part, to contain or restrain his mount. That had two consequences. Mr Goode was not able to prevent his horse moving ever closer to the gradually narrowing gap between Mr Clark and Mr Angland and was equally unable to prevent his horse in effect running into the rear legs of Mr Angland’s horse. As Mr Cumberland told the stewards’ inquiry, it looked like Mr Goode’s horse was over racing at that point “and he just got his head between Tye and whoever was inside Tye and I could see Paul trying to restrain and then he just went down”. Although I have been uninfluenced by the stewards’ decision, I consider that their description of Mr Goode’s horse “improving into an awkward position” is apt. I hasten to add that I do not agree with the stewards’ suggestion that Mr Goode improved to that awkward position “between” Mr Clark and Mr Angland. It is clear in my view that Mr Goode’s horse was never between these other two horses leading up to the fall.
	
	
	Sixthly, I agree with the opinion of Mr Burnett that Mr Goode’s horse drifted slightly away from the rails at the point immediately preceding the fall. That modest outward movement appears to commence at about 16:55:51.20 or thereabouts. It is that movement, in combination with Mr Goode’s horse advancing uncontrolled upon Mr Angland’s horse, that brought them into contact.
	
	
	Seventhly, and consistently with that opinion, I do not accept Mr Killian’s opinion that Mr Goode’s horse was under control just prior to the fall. Mr Cumberland was in a good position to assess this and gave evidence to the contrary. (I do not accept Mr Bartley’s criticism of the value of Mr Cumberland’s possible assistance because he said he “wasn’t watching where Tye’s horse was”. Mr Cumberland said that he was aware when Mr Goode was in trouble and exhibit “E” was tendered by Mr Bartley in his case in any event.) The evidence that Mr Goode’s horse was over racing in the seconds leading up to the fall does not in my opinion leave room for the suggestion that Mr Goode regained control in some very short space before it occurred. Mr Goode was standing very high and somewhat awkwardly in the saddle. This can be seen between 16:55:51.83 and 16:55:54.00, and especially at 16:55:53.61. Mr Killian said, “The jockey was restraining the horse in this instance”, although the precise moment before the fall to which that opinion is referable is not entirely clear. I also prefer the opinion of Mr Burnett that at no stage of the race was Mr Goode “in total control” of his horse.
	
	
	Finally, whatever be the status of the “two lengths” rule, I take it to be the position that no rider is permitted to shift or veer in front of another horse unless or until it is safe to do so, whether that safety margin is measured by a distance of two lengths or some other distance. It will be clear from the views I have already expressed, and I find as a fact, that Mr Angland did not at any time relevantly change direction or veer or shift across Mr Goode’s path when it was unsafe to do so in breach of that rule or unreasonably having regard to the relative positions of each horse.
	


Negligence - conclusions


	
	In my opinion Mr Angland was not negligent in the respects alleged or at all. He did not breach his duty to Mr Goode. He did not ride his horse in a way that caused or contributed to Mr Goode’s fall. Specifically, to the extent, if at all, that Mr Angland’s horse came in towards the rails and closed or narrowed the gap into which Mr Goode was hopeful of improving, it was not causative of what happened to Mr Goode. The fall was caused, despite any such lateral movement of Mr Angland’s horse, by Mr Goode’s horse running uncontrolled into the rear of Mr Angland’s horse where the animals’ legs came into contact. In this respect I consider that Mr Burnett’s analysis, explained in evidence before me and referred to earlier, is an accurate encapsulation of what occurred. That is to say, Mr Burnett put the fall down to the fact that at no stage was Mr Goode in total control of his horse, but can instead be seen throughout the race trying to regain it, while continually moving forward and laterally towards Mr Angland’s horse upon the heels of which he eventually, and very unfortunately, ended up.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	At the point when the fall occurred, Mr Goode’s mount was over racing. Despite his attempts to control the horse, he was unable to do so. That was not caused by anything within his control or by anything that should have been within his control. Mr Goode’s horse moved into a position that caused the fall in circumstances where Mr Goode could have done nothing to prevent it from doing so. The fall was neither caused nor contributed to by anything that Mr Goode either did or failed to do.
	


Civil Liability Act 2002 


	
	Section 5L of the Civil Liability Act 2002 is in the following terms:
	


“5L No liability for harm suffered from obvious risks of dangerous recreational activities

(1)    A person (‘the defendant’) is not liable in negligence for harm suffered by another person (‘the plaintiff’) as a result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity engaged in by the plaintiff.

(2)    This section applies whether or not the plaintiff was aware of the risk.”


	
	Mr Angland contends that Mr Goode’s injuries resulted from the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity. For present purposes that proposition focuses attention upon the meaning of “obvious risk” and “dangerous recreational activity”. These are considered in turn.
	


Obvious Risk


	
	It was not contended by either party that horse riding in general or professional horseracing in particular did not each carry in varying degrees a risk of injury or even death from a fall or that such risks were not obvious. That is to my mind unsurprising. Both the risk that a rider might fall from a horse and the risk that serious injury might be caused by the fall are obvious risks of riding a horse in almost any situation. If either party had sought to contend otherwise I would have rejected the contention.
	
	
	More fundamentally, “obvious risk” is defined in s 5F of the Civil Liability Act, which puts the issue beyond controversy: Section 5F is as follows:
	


“5F Meaning of ‘obvious risk’

(1)    For the purposes of this Division, an ‘obvious risk’ to a person who suffers harm is a risk that, in the circumstances, would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the position of that person.

(2)    Obvious risks include risks that are patent or a matter of common knowledge.

(3)    A risk of something occurring can be an obvious risk even though it has a low probability of occurring.

(4)    A risk can be an obvious risk even if the risk (or a condition or circumstance that gives rise to the risk) is not prominent, conspicuous or physically observable.”

Dangerous Recreational Activity 


	
	In a related sense, neither party sought to argue that horse riding in general or professional horseracing in particular were not also dangerous. As much flows from a recognition of the magnitude of the risk of falling or being thrown from a horse, seen as a function of the likelihood of the occurrence of the risk and the magnitude of the consequences if the risk eventuated. The attention of the parties was instead directed to the concept of what is involved in the concept of a recreational activity.
	
	
	In Dodge v Snell [2011] TASSC 19 the Court concluded that “recreational activity” did not include professional sports. That conclusion was arrived at notwithstanding that the definition of recreational activity expressly includes “any sport”, because it was assumed that the legislature could not have intended to deprive employees of rights to sue their employers. Mr Angland contended that a similar concern was not in New South Wales deserving of an equivalent recognition. This was because the parliament of this State has demonstrated considerably less concern for the common law rights of injured workers. Mr Angland also contended that it was difficult to accept that the legislature intended to abrogate all rights for non-professional participants in sports involving a significant risk of physical harm but to maintain full common law rights for employees who, like Mr Goode, have the protection of workers compensation rights and private disability insurance. In construing the section, the general legislative purpose of the provision is relevant: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1988] HCA 28; (1988) 194 CLR 355 at [69]. To the extent that it is necessary for me to do so, I respectfully disagree with the Tasmanian decision: having regard to their ordinary meaning, the words in the equivalent New South Wales provision do not permit of such a conclusion.
	
	
	Section 5K of the Civil Liability Act defines “dangerous recreational activity” as a recreational activity that involves a significant risk of physical harm. The same section defines “recreational activity” as follows:
	


“‘recreational activity’ includes:

(a)    any sport (whether or not the sport is an organised activity), and

(b)    any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure, and

(c)    any pursuit or activity engaged in at a place (such as a beach, park or other public open space) where people ordinarily engage in sport or in any pursuit or activity for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure.”


	
	It is apparent that a consideration of whether or not professional horseracing is or is not a dangerous recreational activity is not limited to a construction of that compound expression. That is at least clear, if it were not otherwise, from the fact that both “dangerous recreational activity” and “recreational activity” are separately defined in the Act.
	
	
	Mr Angland’s short but principal proposition is that horseracing is a sport and that the definition of recreational activity includes any sport. No distinction is drawn between a professional sport and any other.
	
	
	Mr Goode emphasised the concept of “enjoyment, relaxation or leisure” and relied upon what was said by Ipp JA in Belna Pty Ltd t/a Fernwood Fitness Centre Parramatta v Irwin [2009] NSWCA 46 at [13] and [15] as follows:   
	


“[13] As regards sub-paragraph (a) of s 5K, the Oxford English Dictionary contains many definitions of ‘sport’. Perhaps the most apposite in the context of the statute is ‘participation in activities involving physical exertion and skill’. I would add to this definition the element of participation in those activities for purposes of enjoyment, relaxation or leisure, as s 5K provides. The exercise program undertaken by Ms Irwin involved participation in activities of that kind and, according to ordinary English usage, fell within the meaning of ‘sport’.

…

[15] In examining the three sub-paragraphs of s 5K, I express no opinion as to whether the definition of ‘recreational activity’ in the section is intended to be exhaustive.”


	
	Mr Goode also referred to Motorcycling Events Group Australia Pty Ltd v Kelly [2013] NSWCA 361. In that case Gleeson JA said this:
	


“[100] The respondent submitted that the activity of teaching motorcycling skills was a serious business and that such instruction was not a recreational activity. In my opinion, this submission should be rejected. The respondent was engaged in a recreational activity.

[101] First, it will be observed that the expression ‘recreational activity’ is broadly defined in inclusive terms in s 5K of the Civil Liability Act. Although in Belna Pty Ltd v Irwin [2009] NSWCA 46, Ipp JA (at [15]) (McColl JA and Handley AJA agreeing) refrained from expressing an opinion as to whether the definition is intended to be exhaustive, it is unnecessary, in the present case, to look beyond the express terms of the definition.

[102] Secondly, the emphasis in the definition in s 5K is on engaging in the relevant pursuit or activity for the purposes of enjoyment, relaxation or leisure.

[103] Thirdly, the goal of the activity is relevant in determining whether the activity is or is not a recreational activity: Belna Pty Ltd v Irwin at [14]. In that case, Ipp JA (McColl JA and Handley AJA agreeing) relied upon a questionnaire in which the plaintiff described her short-term goals in undertaking the exercise program as being to ‘enjoy life’ as a basis for finding the program fell within s 5K(b) of the definition of ‘recreational activity’.

[104] Fourthly, the respondent submitted that regard must be had to the particular activities engaged in by the plaintiff at the relevant time. This may be accepted. The respondent’s purposes in undertaking the course were conceded on appeal to be relevant…There was a finding by the primary judge (at [24]) that the respondent wanted to update his skills to become more efficient in cornering when undertaking recreational rides with his wife on weekends. The particular activity engaged in by the respondent at the relevant time was practising a cornering drill on the Eastern Creek racetrack. The fact that the drill was preceded by classroom tuition and that one of the teachers was following on the track behind the respondent does not detract from the ordinary and general description of motorcycle riding at a racetrack as being a ‘recreational activity’. The respondent had been riding motorbikes for about 42 years. His aim in undertaking the Level II course was to obtain skills to equip him for the enjoyment of leisure-time activities when riding on country roads.

[105] In my view, the respondent was clearly engaged in the activity for enjoyment or leisure within the definition of ‘recreational activity’ in s 5K(b).”


	
	There is in my view an immediate tension between those cases that emphasise the recreational element of the activity on the one hand and the anodyne and uncoloured definition of recreational activity as including any sport on the other hand. It is difficult to see how a professional activity, sporting or otherwise, can be considered to be something engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure. That is Mr Goode’s point. By the same token, it is also difficult to see how the ordinary meaning of the words “any sport” does not include professional sport. Indeed, the reference to “any sport” in s 5K(a) is unique in that it does not contain any reference to the words enjoyment, relaxation or leisure that is contained in s 5K(b) and (c). That is Mr Angland’s point.
	
	
	Neither of the cases to which Mr Goode has drawn my attention deals with what is or what is not a sport. Each case was concerned with the question of whether or not a particular activity was a recreational activity. For better or worse, once it is accepted that horseracing is a sport, a matter about which minds might legitimately differ, but which was never put in issue before me, s 5K(a) of the Act seems to be unanswerable. The definition of recreational activity in a way that includes “any sport” leaves no room for an argument that relevantly enlivens the distinction between sport that is undertaken or pursued for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure and sport that is undertaken or pursued as a profession or occupation.
	
	
	Is there room for contending that professional horseracing is not a sport? Sport can be defined as an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment or enjoyment and/or as a job. Horseracing is sometimes described as the sport of kings. I am unaware of any definition of sport that limits it to purely recreational or leisure activities or that excludes professional sport.
	
	
	In my opinion, Mr Goode suffered harm as the result of the materialisation of an obvious risk of a dangerous recreational activity so that s 5L of the Civil Liability Act operates to exclude Mr Angland’s liability in this case.
	


Conclusion on liability


	
	It follows that Mr Goode’s claim fails. There should be a verdict for Mr Angland.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with N Adams J.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with the orders proposed by N Adams J for the reasons her Honour expresses.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: Kees Langelaar (“the applicant”) appeals against his conviction and makes application for leave to appeal against his sentence. He appeared unrepresented at the hearing of his appeal. He is 72 years of age.
	


Background


	
	On 22 May 2012, the applicant stood trial in the District Court at Taree on five counts of sexual intercourse with a person over the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years who was then under his authority contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of indecent assault on a person under the age of 16 years contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. The applicant pleaded not guilty to all counts and his trial proceeded before Williams DCJ and a jury of twelve.
	
	
	On 31 May 2012, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to four of the five counts on the indictment contrary to s 66C(4) (Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5) and in relation to the one count of indecent assault (Count 3). The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in relation to the remaining count (Count 6).
	
	
	On 11 November 2013, Williams DCJ sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of three years. The indicative sentence of imprisonment for each of Counts 1 and 2 was two years and six months, for Count 3 it was three years with a non-parole period of two years, for Count 4 it was three years and for Count 5 it was four years.
	


The Crown case


	
	The Crown case relied predominantly upon the evidence of the complainant. Her evidence in chief was given by way of recorded interview, supplemented by further oral evidence. The complainant’s grandmother, the applicant’s ex-partner Ms Tracey Goodwin and the officer in charge were the other three witnesses called for the prosecution. The applicant did not participate in an ERISP nor did he give evidence at his trial. His daughter S was the only witness called to give evidence in his case.
	
	
	The evidence given at trial can be briefly summarised as follows.
	
	
	As at 2012 the applicant was living with his then partner Ms Goodwin, their two daughters and the applicant’s brother at a large house with attached flats in Wingham, near Taree. The complainant was friends with the applicant’s oldest daughter S. Both S and the complainant were fifteen years old.
	
	
	In May 2012, the complainant moved in with the applicant and his family. She had previously been living with her grandmother, but had been asked to leave after getting into trouble with the police. On prior occasions she had stayed overnight at the applicant’s house and as such knew the family well.
	


Context evidence


	
	The complainant and the applicant developed a close relationship in which the applicant was described in evidence as acting as a sort of “father figure” for her. They spoke about their problems together. A few weeks after the complainant started living with the applicant and his family, the applicant started doing things which were “kinda sexual” to the complainant. He would tell her she had a “better arse” than his daughter’s and talk about his “sex life”. He would rub up against her and rub his hands up and down her legs and “stuff like that.” He would kiss her on the lips “maybe every day” and on occasion it would be “passionately like a full on kiss.”
	
	
	There was evidence that the complainant would walk around in her underwear in front of the applicant. There was also evidence that the complainant would sit with her legs on the applicant’s lap under a blanket watching television. Sometimes she would be wearing a t-shirt and underwear. This conduct was observed by Ms Goodwin who described their body language as being “way out of whack.” She spoke to the applicant about it. He replied, “This is not happening at all” and “…then he said that if I don’t stop harassing him that he’ll have sex with her on her sixteenth birthday.”
	
	
	On 30 May 2012, the complainant took part in an electronically recorded interview with police. Therein she outlined a number of specific allegations against the applicant. When she gave evidence she stated that there were “numerous times” when the applicant put his fingers inside her vagina.
	
	
	In relation to the six counts on the indictment at trial the evidence was as follows.
	


Count 1: Aggravated sexual intercourse


	
	On one occasion the complainant was sitting on the lounge at night watching television with the applicant. Her legs were draped over the applicant’s legs. The applicant rubbed the complainant’s legs up and down and then penetrated her vagina with his finger. The complainant did not say anything to the applicant. She told police she didn’t stop it because she liked it. She was wearing a t-shirt and pyjama pants at the time. She told the court in relation to that incident that “it was the same as every other time” and “it was the same routine.”
	
	
	Ms Goodwin was in her bedroom at this time and S was asleep on another couch in the same room.
	


Count 2: Aggravated sexual intercourse


	
	On another occasion the complainant was sitting on the lounge at night watching television with the applicant with her legs across the applicant’s lap. The applicant rubbed the complainant’s legs up and down and then penetrated her vagina with his thumb. She was wearing a t-shirt and pyjama pants at the time. She did not say anything to the applicant. Afterwards he said to her, “The thumb is always the best.”
	


Count 3: Aggravated indecent assault


	
	On one occasion while the applicant and the complainant were in the lounge room seated on the couch with a blanket over both of them, the applicant requested that the complainant give him a “hand job” and she complied. In her interview she told police he didn’t really say anything, “he just undone his pants and yeah.” At the trial she gave evidence that the applicant “zipped down his pants and he put my hand on his penis.”
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that she stroked the applicant’s penis for about 10-15 minutes until he ejaculated in her hand. When she walked away from him after this he thanked her.
	


Counts 4 - 6: Aggravated sexual intercourse


	
	The final three counts on the indictment all arose from one incident.
	


Count 4


	
	The applicant was sitting on the lounge with her legs across the applicant’s lap late at night. S was in bed and Ms Goodwin and the applicant’s younger daughter had gone to stay with a relative following a fight between the applicant and Ms Goodwin.
	
	
	The complainant was wearing a t-shirt, underpants and maybe a bra. They were both under a blanket. The applicant started touching the complainant’s legs and then started touching her vagina. He inserted his fingers in and out of her vagina. She told police in her interview that she did not tell him to stop because she liked it. This occurred for about five minutes. They did not say anything to each other during this time and they remained covered by the blanket.
	


Count 5


	
	After the above sexual act, the applicant asked the complainant if she wanted to go somewhere else in case S came in. She followed him into his bedroom. She told him that she did not wish to have sex with him and he said that was fine. They kissed each other passionately.
	
	
	The complainant told police that the applicant “just kept pushing me to have sex. I didn’t want to so I gave him oral sex instead.” The complainant then sucked the applicant’s penis, which was “hard.” She said this occurred for a period which was “not long.”
	


Count 6


	
	This was the count in relation to which the applicant was acquitted. After the act of fellatio, the applicant told the complainant to get on the bed. He removed her underpants. She stated he “got his penis into my vagina” from behind whilst she was on her knees. She stated that his penis was not inside her for very long before the applicant ejaculated inside her vagina.
	
	
	The applicant then put his pants back on and told the complainant to, “Go clean yourself up”. The complainant guessed it was about 2.30am at this stage. She told police that having sexual intercourse with the applicant had made her feel “yuck” and said, “I didn’t like it. I was scared”.
	
	
	When the complainant was re-examined by the Crown Prosecutor she stated that she could not put the four separate incidents into a clear chronological sequence.
	


The interrupted kiss


	
	The complainant gave evidence that one evening, just before she moved out of the applicant’s premises, S and her boyfriend went out together to buy ice cream. When they returned at some point between 11pm and midnight, S walked into the lounge room and saw the complainant and the applicant kissing. The complainant described it as a “passionate kiss” and agreed that tongues were involved. She stated, “S went off and she went into her room.” The complainant said that the applicant told her to tell S, “that we were mocking them, S and her boyfriend, which was the most stupidest lie I’ve ever heard in my whole entire life.” The complainant stated that she had to tell S this and also the applicant’s partner Tracey Goodwin. Ms Goodwin said to her, “I want you out by the end of the week.”
	
	
	Ms Goodwin gave evidence that she was awoken one night by S at about 11.30pm. S said, “I just caught my dad hooking up with [the complainant]”. Ms Goodwin went out to the lounge room and saw the complainant and the applicant under a blanket together on the couch. Ms Goodwin said “What the hell’s going on here? [S]’s just come out and…told me that you’re hooking up with [the complainant]. What – what the hell’s going on?” The complainant and the applicant then said that it was not true and that they were just imitating S and her boyfriend. At this time S “went absolutely berko” at the complainant and said, “You’re out of here. You’re leaving tomorrow. How sick are you for hooking up with my dad.” S also told Ms Goodwin that, when they were caught, the complainant had pulled the blanket up over her head and said “Awkies [a colloquial expression they both used meaning “awkward”]. I just hooked up with your father.”
	
	
	S did not provide a statement to police, but gave evidence in the defence case. She said that when she walked into the lounge room that night all she saw was a “peck” on the lips that lasted “less than a second.” S said she went into her parent’s room to tell her mother. She stated her reason as, “Mum had been saying all this stuff about [the complainant] and Dad and all these allegations and stuff and I thought that maybe it was true. But I think I made an overreaction.”
	
	
	In cross-examination S agreed that she had seen the complainant and the applicant exchange a goodnight kiss on previous occasions. She was asked what it was about this particular kiss that prompted her to wake her mother up. She replied, “I’m not sure; I was very stressed out; my health and that. Mum had been talking about this a lot, and I’d overheard some things, but I don’t really remember what they were, but it was in my mind at the time.”
	


Evidence of complaint


	
	The complainant gave evidence in cross-examination that she had not said anything to her best friend, the applicant’s daughter S, about what was happening. She said this was because “she [S] wouldn’t believe me; because it’s her father, she loves him.”
	
	
	The day after the interrupted kiss the complainant moved back in with her grandmother. She was asked to see a counsellor and told the counsellor about kissing the applicant. The counsellor told her this was inappropriate and spoke to her grandmother. The matter was subsequently referred to police at which time the allegations of sexual assault were first made.
	


Admissions made to Tracey Goodwin


	
	Tracey Goodwin gave evidence that, a few days after the complainant moved out, she left the applicant and booked into a motel. On 17 June 2012, she returned to their home and spoke with the applicant. He told her that he had to get a catheter inserted. She responded, “Oh, you’ve probably got an STD from [the complainant].” The applicant replied, “Oh ten points for Tracey” and motioned as if to write a tick on the wall. Ms Goodwin said to the applicant, “Now that we’re alone can you be honest with me? Did you have sex with [the complainant]?” The applicant started to cry and said, “Yes, I did have sex with [the complainant].” Ms Goodwin swore at him and he responded, “It was a mistake, I should never have done it.”
	
	
	The applicant told Ms Goodwin that he had had sex with the complainant on three occasions. Once in the hallway near a door frame and another time in the kitchen pantry. Ms Goodwin stated that she did not wish to know about the third occasion. She told the court, “I just needed air. I just burst into tears and walked out…onto the verandah.” He said to her, “[the complainant] has a much cuter arse that you’ll ever have”. In cross-examination she agreed that he said to her, “Yeah I fucked her, whatever.” It was put to her that those words were said in the heat of an argument, but she replied they were spoken calmly.
	


Other evidence


	
	The complainant’s grandmother gave evidence that the complainant’s mother was married to her eldest grandson, but that he was not the complainant’s father. The complainant had entered her care through “DOCS”. She and the complainant used to argue a lot and when she found out that the complainant had been caught drinking at a hotel she told the complainant that she had to leave. She agreed in cross-examination that the complainant had been in trouble at school and had long-standing mental health problems.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Elizabeth Dean, the officer in charge, gave evidence that the complainant’s allegation was referred to the Child Abuse Squad in Port Macquarie in May 2012 for investigation. The complainant was interviewed on 30 May 2012 and the applicant was arrested on 7 June 2012. Although he exercised his right to silence he did tell police whilst in the custody area of the police station that he was aware that the complainant was 15 years old and told police, “She turns 16 soon.”
	


The defence case


	
	The defence case as put through cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, the evidence of S and the closing address was that the offences did not occur. The defence case relied upon the complainant’s troubled history and mental health issues. Counsel for the applicant pointed to the inconsistencies between Ms Goodwin’s evidence of the applicant’s admissions to her, to the effect that he had sex with the complainant three times including once in the hallway and once in the pantry, and the evidence of the complainant that “sex” had only occurred once and it had occurred in the bedroom.
	
	
	It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that the situation had “snowballed.” She saw her counsellor and got some sympathy and was then able to go back her grandmother’s house. She denied this.
	
	
	It was put to the jury that Ms Goodwin misinterpreted what she observed and what the applicant told her. There was a history of jealousy and unfaithfulness in the relationship between the applicant and Ms Goodwin.
	
	
	Reliance was placed upon S’s evidence that she never saw her father behave inappropriately towards the complainant.
	


Appeal against conviction


	
	A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 4 September 2013, in which the applicant sought an extension of time within which to file a Notice of Appeal. An amended Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 11 November 2013. The life of the Notice of Intention to Appeal was subsequently extended a number of times, with the expiration date for the last extension being 18 March 2015. A Notice of Appeal was filed on 4 November 2015.
	
	
	There was no opposition to the applicant being granted a further extension of time to bring his appeal.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	At the hearing of the appeal the applicant relied upon a number of handwritten and typed documents. That material comprises documents relied upon as submissions, documents relied upon as evidence in support of some of his grounds and other documents relied upon as “fresh” evidence. The applicant initially relied upon five grounds of appeal in his handwritten document headed “Grounds of Appeal,” filed on 4 November 2015. He relied upon a further 10 grounds of appeal as set out in an undated document also headed “Grounds of Appeal,” which forms part of the material filed in support of the appeal. For ease of reference, the ten grounds contained in the second document filed will be re-numbered 6-15 (rather than 1-10)
	


First (handwritten) grounds of appeal

Ground 1:   His Honour stated he was confused as to how the jury dismissed some charges and yet found the defendant guilty of others.

Ground 2:   2 Key defence witnesses who made sworn affidavits in [sic] the innocence of the defendant were not brought at the trial.

Ground 3:   There was no corroborating evidence provided by the DPP e.g. DNA or other witnesses.

Ground 4:   His Honour at the sentence hearing wrongly stated that I had self confessed when he was accepting a statement made by my ex partner which was not a confession by me to the court

Ground 5:   The victim did not follow the required procedure before reporting to the police. The ‘victim’ is required to be referred to a sexual assault service before the police take a statement. This removed the clear opportunity for any forensic evidence which would have cleared me of wrongdoing.

Further grounds of appeal

Ground 6   There was no objective evidence.

Ground 7:   It was the 15 year old [complainant’s] word against the 70 year old applicant Kees Langelaar and Kees was not allowed to speak. Prior to the trial he was judged as too old to speak clearly or be on topic by his own Solicitor and Barrister.

Ground 8:   Statements [the complainant] was sexually experienced prior to the allegations of sexual assault were not compiled and given as evidence.

Ground 9:   A complete medical record of Kees has not been completed regarded sexual function and capability. Kees had needed Viagra in his relationship with his previous de-factor partner and is currently awaiting test results for prostate cancer. Dr Nagaonkar has said the prostate is double normal size. There is also a diagnosis of Essential Tremor. Kees’ medical report describes “Essential Tremor is a neurological (nervous system) disorder which causes involuntary shaking and trembling of particular parts of the body.”

Ground 10:   A list of statements from previous men in [the complainant’s] family who had been accused by [the complainant] of sexual assault were not compiled.

Ground 11:   Kees’ solicitor and barrister believed [the complainant’s] testimony had so much emotional transport and conviction that things looked very bad and so they focussed primarily upon getting a confession from their client throughout the trial and after.

Ground 12:   Statements from numerous community members regarding Kees' history of good parenting and supervision of their children were not taken into account.

Ground 13:   A statement from Rhonda Jean Mills, a Facebook friend of [the complainant] quoted [the complainant’s] public Facebook Post as saying “Shut the fuck up you jealous bitches, I haven’t slept with a 71 year old man”. This statement was not given in evidence

Ground 14:   A later statement was given by Timothy Coulson, a friend of [the complainant]. The conversation went:

[“What happened between you and Kees? [The complainant] said “Nothing”. Timothy said “well what’s happening at court?” [The complainant] said “I don’t know. I’m not being told anything but nothing really happened.]

This statement has not yet been given as evidence

Ground 15:   The Crown’s entire position rested on one fact. [The complainant] made a statement to the police and that is all there ever was and ever has been.


	
	The 15 grounds relied upon can be conveniently dealt with in sub-groups. Grounds 2 and 14 will be considered under the heading “fresh evidence.” Grounds 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 will be considered under the heading “incompetence of counsel.” Grounds 8 and 10 will be considered under the heading “Section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act” and Grounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 15 will be considered under the heading “unreasonable verdicts.” Ground 4 will be dealt with as part of the application to seek leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	It is noted that none of the 15 grounds upon which the applicant relies involves a question of law alone. It has been held that leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is required to raise a ground of appeal involving a question of fact or of mixed law and fact: Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. See also Krishna v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318; 178 A Crim R 220 at [2]; Yacoub v R [2008] NSWCCA 164 at [2]; Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322 at [44] and at [68]-[71] and Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244 at [10]- [12].
	
	
	In the present case, no point having been taken on behalf of the Crown and, in circumstances where the applicant was unrepresented on his appeal, it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave to appeal in relation to the grounds relied upon in the appeal against conviction.
	


Fresh evidence (Grounds 2 and 14)


	
	Before turning to consider the evidence of the two witnesses relied upon by the applicant as “fresh evidence,” it is pertinent to note the relevant principles regarding fresh evidence on appeal. These principles are well established in cases including Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392; Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259 and Ratten v R (1974) 131 CLR 510. These principles were conveniently summarised by Kirby J in Abou-Chabake v R [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63] as follows
	


“First, a distinction is made between ""new evidence"" and ""fresh evidence"". Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence.

Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 512).

Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301).

Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought.

Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the applicant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v The Queen (supra) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen [1986] HCA 26; (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399).

Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:

Is the evidence fresh?

If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or ""plausible"" (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?

If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ at 301-302.

Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s474D Crimes Act 1900). It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v The Queen (supra) at 517).”


	
	Assuming that the evidence is “fresh” and also that it is credible or plausible and this Court admits it on the appeal, the question then is whether, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, it would have been likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused or, to put it another way, whether there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused.
	
	
	The fresh evidence relied upon by the applicant consisted of two statements: one from his ex-partner Tracey Goodwin and another from a man named Timothy Coulson.
	


Evidence of Tracey Goodwin


	
	The applicant filed a signed statement of Tracey Goodwin dated 16 July 2013. This statement post-dates the applicant’s trial, in which she gave evidence on 28 May 2013, by nearly two months. The statement is in the following terms:
	


My name is Tracy Goodwin. I have been the partner of Kees Langelaar for 18 years. I regret giving testimony at Taree Court, where I stated I believe Kees had sex with the complainant. After counselling I can see I brought feelings of betrayal from the past into the present. I had no evidence. I saw nothing or heard nothing or have no other information. I gave this opinion from my own feelings of hurt and betrayal, where Kees has been unfaithful and betrayed me, many years ago. I’m sorry I contributed to Kees conviction and deeply regret being mistaken in my testimony.

As a result I also feel impelled to give a statement about the difficulties in my sex life with Kees. Kees is 70. Sex has not been straightforward or consistent in recent years. Kees has been prescribed Viagra by various doctors. The last three years we have tried Viagra and he is more able to sustain an erection and without this he has difficulty. In hindsight, this is another reason I can see my feelings of betrayal from the past. With Kees sexual difficulties or level of sex drive, we have only had sex less than a handful of times in the last 18 months or so. Even then, there is an increased period of time to get to the point of readiness, especially when compared to a decade ago.

I hope that this statement clears up my misunderstandings and any contribution I had in giving accidental though ungrounded testimony based upon my past feelings of betrayal. It is true that Kees has been an unfaithful and hurtful partner in the past, however this was only ever adults and never age inappropriate relationships. I’m sorry.

Sincerely,

Tracy Goodwin


	
	Ms Goodwin was called to give evidence on the appeal. Before she gave evidence, a solicitor employed by Legal Aid NSW provided her with legal advice.
	
	
	Ms Goodwin gave evidence that, although she signed the document, it was not drafted by her. She said, “It was drafted by Kees and by his friend.” The friend was Daniel Armfield, who is both a friend of the applicant and her granddaughter’s uncle. This occurred at the applicant’s place. She gave evidence that she “wanted to decline it” but did not know when she was supposed to “say decline.”
	
	
	Ms Goodwin stated that she had attended the applicant’s home to visit her daughter S who was residing with him. She went on to state:
	


“Kees and his friend said that this would help him in his case but I said to him that – would this be any conflict of interest with the court papers that I made in the proceedings?


	
	She was told there would not be any conflict. She also stated that she was on ""really strong anti-depressants” at the time and only “read it today and realised that there was a conflict of interests.”
	
	
	The witness was given a warning under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). She objected to giving certain evidence and a certificate under that section was granted to her. Of the three paragraphs in the statement she indicated that the middle one was true but the first and last were not. She confirmed that the applicant was able to get an erection, albeit with a degree of difficulty.
	
	
	Given the fact that Ms Goodwin did not ultimately adopt the “fresh evidence” said to be a recantation of her evidence at trial, the evidence lacks any cogency. There is nothing in the evidence of Ms Goodwin which would lead this Court to conclude that, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, it would have been likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.
	


Timothy Coulson


	
	The second witness relied upon by the applicant was Timothy Coulson. The applicant relied upon a statement of Mr Coulson dated 27 June 2013 (nearly a month after the trial) which was in the following terms:
	


My name is Timothy Coulson and I live at 2/29 Florence Street, Taree. I am a friend of [the complainant] and I’ve known her approximately 7 years. I’m a

friend of Kees Langelaar and I’ve known him approximately 9 years.

On 14 May 2013, I was spending time with [the complainant] and asked, “What happened between you and Kees?”

She said “nothing”.

I said, “Well what’s happening with court?”

She said, “I don’t know, I’m not been told anything but nothing really happened.”

The conversation and moved on to other topics. For any further information please feel free to contact me on 0435 712 685

Timothy Colson

2/29 Florence Street

Taree New South Wales 2430


	
	The applicant’s trial solicitor gave evidence on the appeal that he had asked the applicant to provide the names of any potential witnesses and Mr Coulson’s name was never mentioned to him. There is no evidence before the Court as to how the statement came to be created, nor why it was not brought to the attention of the applicant’s legal team at trial.
	
	
	Mr Coulson could not be located to give evidence at the hearing of the appeal. The applicant had made no efforts to locate him. At a mention of this matter before the CCA Registrar on 22 April 2016, he told the representative for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that Mr Coulson resided in Taree. Efforts were then made by police to locate the witness in Taree to no avail. When an affidavit to that effect was read by the Crown during the hearing of the appeal, the applicant raised for the first time the fact that Mr Coulson was now living in Forbes. In any event he did not attend this Court to give evidence concerning the statement said to have been made by him.
	
	
	In circumstances where the witness did not give evidence in this Court and the Crown was not afforded the opportunity to cross-examine him, the Court does not propose to admit his statement into evidence on the appeal. It is not possible to determine its provenance or even whether it is “fresh” evidence.
	
	
	In any event, even if the statement had been adopted by Mr Coulson and it was found to be credible, its contents are of little weight in the context of the evidence called at trial. The conversation contained therein could easily be explained on a number of bases including embarrassment on the part of the complainant and a desire not to talk about the subject matter any further. Even if it had been in evidence at trial, it would not have been likely to have caused the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the applicant’s guilt.
	
	
	Grounds 2 and 14 pertaining to “fresh” evidence are not made out.
	


Incompetence of counsel (Grounds 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13)


	
	A number of allegations are made by the applicant in the documents filed concerning his solicitor and barrister in support of a contention that his trial miscarried due to the incompetence of his counsel. There are considerable hurdles an applicant must clear in order to establish any ground of appeal asserting incompetence of counsel.
	
	
	The starting point is that an applicant is usually bound by the way in which counsel conducts his or her trial. Counsel has a wide discretion to make decisions during the trial. As Gleeson CJ (with whom McInerney J agreed) observed in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685:
	


“2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.”


	
	In order to succeed in relation to the grounds of appeal alleging incompetence on the part of his counsel, the applicant must establish that the conduct of his counsel has led to a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124, Gaudron J (with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed) observed at [32]:
	


“An accused will not ordinarily be deprived of a chance of acquittal that is fairly open if that chance is foreclosed by an informed and deliberate decision to pursue or not to pursue a particular course at trial.”


	
	Similarly, McHugh J observed the following in TKWJ v The Queen at [52]:
	


“The decision not to call the good character evidence was a matter falling within the discretion of counsel as to how he would conduct the defence and did not constitute a material irregularity that led to a miscarriage of justice”

His Honour went on to observe at [74]:

“Ordinarily, a party is held to the way in which his or her counsel has presented the party's case. That is because counsel is in effect the party's agent. Counsel is “ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted.” The discretion retained by counsel in the running of a case is very wide.”


	
	As Gleeson CJ later observed in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [9]:
	


“A criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation. A cardinal principle of such litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue. The law does not pursue that principle at all costs. It recognises the possibility that justice may demand exceptions. Nevertheless, the nature of adversarial litigation, with its principles concerning the role of counsel, sets the context in which these issues arise. Considerations of fairness often turn upon the choices made by counsel at a trial. In TKWJ v The Queen, the applicant complained that evidence of his good character was not led. This, it was said, was unfair. In rejecting that argument, this Court said that the failure to call the evidence was the result of a decision by counsel, and that, viewed objectively, it was a rational decision. That, in the circumstances of the case, was conclusive. It is the fairness of the process that is in question; not the wisdom of counsel. As a general rule, counsel's decisions bind the client. If it were otherwise, the adversarial system could not function. The fairness of the process is to be judged in that light. The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel's conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct” (citations omitted).


	
	This Court has recently considered these principles in Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4, Vella v R [2015] NSWCCA 148, Ahmu v R [2014] NSWCCA 312, Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329 and Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187.
	
	
	The ultimate question for an appellate court is whether the applicant has established that what occurred at the trial gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the applicant lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.
	
	
	Affidavits from the barrister sworn 7 April 2016 and the solicitor sworn 21 April 2016 were filed in the proceedings. Their affidavits were read at the hearing of the appeal and both lawyers gave further oral evidence.
	
	
	There is authority for the proposition that affidavits from an applicant’s previous lawyers should not be read on the appeal as a matter of course.
	
	
	In Nudd v R, Gleeson CJ observed the following on the question of whether counsel should be called as a witness in appeal proceedings of this nature (at [10]):
	


“To the extent to which it is reasonably possible, the focus of attention should be the objective features of the trial process. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances where it is relevant to ask why some act or omission occurred. In some cases, for example, it may be material to know that counsel took a certain course upon the instructions of the client. There could be circumstances in which it is material to know that a course was taken contrary to instructions. The possibility of a need to know the reason for conduct cannot altogether be eliminated. In general, however, as far as justice permits, the enquiry should be objective. As a matter of principle, such objectivity is consistent with the assumptions on which the adversarial system operates. As a matter of practicality, it avoids the difficulties inherent in turning a criminal appeal into an investigation of the performance of trial counsel.”


	
	Similarly, Gummow and Hayne JJ referred in Nudd v R to the applicant’s complaints that his trial counsel had failed to give him proper advice and observed at [27]:
	


“… a failure to give proper advice to the applicant would be significant only if, as a result of that failure, something was done or not done at trial that was, or occasioned, a miscarriage of justice. For the reasons given in TKWJ, the inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry, not an examination of what trial counsel for an accused did or did not know or think about. The critical question is what did or did not happen at trial, not why that came about.”


	
	In Matthews v R, this Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Leeming JA and Beech-Jones J) observed the following at [63] in an appeal dealing with a ground of incompetence of counsel:
	


“In conducting that inquiry a number of related matters should be noted. First, there is vested in counsel for an accused person control over and responsibility for the manner in which the trial will be conducted (TKWJ at [74] per McHugh J). Second, relevant unfairness will not be established simply because an ‘apparently rational decision’ by trial counsel produced adverse consequences for the accused (TKWJ at [16] per Gleeson CJ). Third, inquiries into the subjective thought processes of counsel for taking the steps they did at the trial are to be avoided. Instead the question is whether there could be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial (Ali per Hayne J, with whom Gummow J agreed at [25]; TKWJ at [110] per Hayne J). If there could be such an explanation then no error or defect in the trial occasioning any miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred (Ali id). Fourth, although the inquiry into whether there was an explanation for counsel's conduct is an objective one, there are some perhaps limited circumstances in which it is necessary for the appeal court to be apprised of material such as counsel's instructions (Nudd at [10] and [17] per Gleeson CJ).”


	
	The question of the admissibility of such affidavit material on appeal was again considered by this Court in Ahmu v R, another appeal in which the applicant contended that he had suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of trial counsel’s incompetence. Basten JA rejected an affidavit sworn by trial counsel on the basis that it did not add anything to the inferences otherwise available from the course of the trial (at [31]). Adams J took a contrary view and considered the affidavit to be relevant and admissible (at [55]). Fullerton J found it unnecessary to express any concluded view on the question (at [87]).
	
	
	More recently in Vella v R, another appeal involving an allegation of incompetence of counsel, evidence from trial counsel was admitted on the appeal. Beech-Jones J (with whom Gleeson JA and Hidden J relevantly agreed) noted at [94], after referring to the decisions in Matthews v R, that there was “…some scope for uncertainty as to the extent to which evidence from an applicant’s former counsel and solicitor explaining their conduct can be received and considered in determining a complaint that a miscarriage of justice arose from it (see Ahmu at [31] per Basten JA and at [53] per Adams J).”
	
	
	Finally, it is to be observed that the trial counsel and solicitor were both called to give evidence on appeal in the recent decision of Alkhair v R.
	
	
	At least some of the allegations made by the applicant in this appeal could be resolved without the need to have regard to the evidence of the applicant’s trial counsel and solicitor. Despite this, given the seriousness of some of the allegations made and the fact that, as the applicant was not represented, this issue could not be properly ventilated at the hearing of the appeal, I propose to refer to the relevant evidence given by the trial counsel and solicitor in determining these grounds. I do so having regard to the fact that the role for this Court is to undertake an objective inquiry regarding whether there was a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 rather than to conduct an inquiry into what trial counsel did or did not know or consider.
	
	
	With the above principles in mind I turn to consider the various complaints made by the applicant concerning his counsel.
	


Key defence witnesses were not called at his trial


	
	The applicant complains that the evidence of a witness named Rhonda Mills should have been adduced at trial. A statement made by Ms Mills dated 25 June 2012 and headed “Affidavit, Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998” was filed by the applicant with his other documentation. In it Ms Mills states that she knows the applicant and Ms Goodwin and through them met the complainant. She described the complainant as becoming one of her “Facebook” friends. Ms Mills did not allow her daughter to have her own Facebook account, requiring her instead to use Ms Mills’ account. Anyone whom her daughter contacted therefore appeared on Ms Mills’ Facebook feed. She states that the complainant became a Facebook friend “about a month ago” (which would have been a date in May 2012). She then states:
	


“Not long after [the complainant] had become a “Facebook friend” of mine I saw a text message on her “Facebook Wall” as follows:

“Shut the fuck up, you jealous bitches, I haven’t slept with a 71-year-old man”. When I looked again at her Facebook site that evening the message had been removed.”


	
	The applicant’s solicitor gave evidence about this statement at the hearing of the appeal. He stated that he was aware of this statement because he prepared it in relation to care proceedings pertaining to the applicant’s youngest daughter. He did not brief it to counsel for the applicant’s trial. Consistent with this, the barrister’s evidence was that he was not aware of this statement.
	
	
	Two reasons were advanced by the solicitor as his explanation for not calling Ms Mills to give evidence at the applicant’s trial. In his affidavit he set out his reason as being that it was hearsay evidence and hence inadmissible. Ms Mills had no evidence as to who the author of the alleged Facebook page was and relied upon her recollection. The solicitor expanded upon this during his evidence on the appeal, stating that the statement had in fact been tendered in the care proceedings in the Local Court. Those proceedings resulted in the applicant’s youngest daughter being placed in the care of the Minister. The solicitor stated that when he sought to tender it the Magistrate’s response was, “This is equally consistent with the complainant covering up for having had sex with a man of that age.” The solicitor stated that the reason he did not seek to have Ms Mills called at trial was, “I thought it was dangerous because….it’d been tested by a tribunal of fact and it had, to, to my way of thinking it was damaging rather than exculpatory…From the words of the Magistrate it could have gone either way. So if I wasn’t sure, if in doubt, don’t.”
	
	
	On its face, and even without regard being had to the explanation of the solicitor, the fact that this statement was not briefed to counsel and the witness not called at trial does not amount to a miscarriage of justice in the context of the evidence given at trial.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


The applicant was not allowed to give evidence.


	
	The applicant’s barrister deposed that the applicant’s instructions were that he did not want to give evidence. In addition, the applicant’s solicitor deposed:
	


“Both [the barrister] and I determined that when Kees was asked questions he was inclined to go into elaborate and self serving statements and submissions about the evidence and not answer the question that he was asked. We could not rely on him to give short succinct answers to questions that he may have been asked in cross examination. We were absolutely certain that allowing Kees to give his evidence before the jury would be a disaster and we determined that Kees would not give any evidence at the trial”


	
	Consistent with the relevant authorities, the forensic decision as to whether an accused person should be called as a witness in his or her own trial is one for counsel to make.
	
	
	Whether or not the applicant wished to give evidence, it would have been open to the applicant’s counsel to conclude that there were disadvantages in calling the applicant to give evidence at trial given the allegations made in the Crown case. To the extent that it is relevant to this ground, it is noted that the applicant addressed this Court in the course of the hearing of his appeal. He volunteered his version of what occurred during the interrupted kiss incident outlined at [28]-[31] above. The applicant informed the court of the following:
	


“Also, we had an imitation kiss, a pretending kiss and she was sitting on my lap so there’s no way anyone coming in the room could have even seen that we were kissing, even if we were.”

He later said:

“”I never kissed a girl ever. And she sat on my knee, the door is there and my daughter comes in and we pretended to kiss and she couldn’t have seen anything of our kiss anyway. So that is – the whole thing is ridiculous”


	
	The evidence at trial regarding the interrupted kiss was significant evidence in the Crown case. The applicant’s daughter S gave unconvincing evidence that seemed to downplay the significance of it, but at no time was it put to her that she did not or could not have seen any kiss. On the contrary, the applicant’s counsel called S in the applicant’s case and adduced from her that all she saw a “peck”. The applicant’s explanation given on appeal was inconsistent with evidence called in his own case and quite implausible in the circumstances of the evidence given at trial.
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice has been established regarding the fact that the applicant did not give evidence at his trial. This ground is not made out.
	


Medical records of erectile dysfunction and tremors 


	
	The applicant complained that his lawyers failed to adduce at trial medical evidence showing, inter alia, that he suffered from erectile dysfunction. He produced various medical records in support of this ground of appeal.
	
	
	The evidence of both the applicant’s barrister and solicitor was that the applicant at no time raised an issue of erectile dysfunction with them. The barrister gave evidence on the appeal that, “…that would have been something, of course, that I would have asked [the solicitor] to get some instructions about and, of course, it would have been an important aspect to raise particularly concerning the evidence of Tracey Goodwin, and that was never an issue.” Similarly the solicitor gave evidence that he was aware of the possibility that the applicant had prostate cancer and was aware that he had “urination problems” but was provided with no medical evidence of this nor any material concerning possible erectile dysfunction.
	
	
	As referred to above, Tracey Goodwin gave evidence on the hearing of the appeal that the applicant was able to get an erection, albeit with some difficulty. She stated that that part of her statement dated 16 July 2013 was true.
	
	
	None of the medical records provided by the applicant supports the proposition that he was unable to sustain an erection at the time of the offences. They confirm that he was prescribed Viagra in 2010.
	
	
	The applicant provided as part of his bundle of documents the letter of instructions to his legal representatives made prior to the trial. There is no reference therein to the question of any erectile dysfunction. The fact that the applicant made no mention of it at that time is consistent with the applicant not having any significant erectile dysfunction at that time.
	
	
	Furthermore, and in any event, of the five counts in relation to which the applicant was convicted only two of them included an assertion that the applicant had an erect penis: count 3 was an allegation that the complainant stroked the applicant’s penis until he ejaculated and count 5 was a count regarding an act of fellatio. The other three counts in relation to which the applicant was convicted involved an allegation that the applicant digitally penetrated the complainant’s vagina. In those circumstances, even if some form of erectile dysfunction could be established (which is not the case), it was not relevant to three of the five counts upon which he was convicted
	
	
	No miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the absence of medical evidence at trial. This ground is not made out.
	


Counsel and solicitor pressured him into making a confession


	
	The applicant alleges that his lawyers forced him to confess his guilt to the Probation and Parole Officer. There is also an allegation that they pressured him to plead guilty before the trial. These two specific complaints appear to form part of a larger complaint that the applicant’s legal team did not try hard enough to secure an acquittal because they believed he was guilty.
	
	
	The two specific complaints made by the applicant as part of this ground could not of themselves be relevant to the question of whether the trial miscarried. The fact is that the applicant did not plead guilty and his trial proceeded. Similarly, the allegation that he was coerced into making a false confession to the Probation and Parole Officer is said to have occurred after the trial, so that could not be relevant to whether the trial miscarried. Despite this and in circumstances where the central complaint appears to be one of counsel generally not defending him properly because of a belief in his guilt, I will address the allegations as part of the question of whether the applicant has established that his trial miscarried due to some general approach taken by his legal team.
	
	
	The background to the most serious allegation made by the applicant is as follows.
	
	
	Upon the applicant’s being found guilty by the jury on 31 May 2013, a Pre-Sentence Report was ordered and the proceedings stood over for sentence. The applicant’s bail was continued. When the matter came on for sentence on 12 July 2013, the transcript of proceedings on that day records that the applicant’s counsel and his solicitor withdrew from the matter due to an “ethical issue.”
	
	
	The applicant having now waived privilege in relation to that issue, the applicant’s barrister explained what occurred in his affidavit sworn 7 April 2016. He states that, on 31 May 2013 following the verdict, the barrister, solicitor and applicant held a conference at the Taree court complex. The barrister deposes:
	


“At this conference the Applicant said words to the effect of “I’m glad it’s all over, I know I should never have had sex with her, I just couldn’t help myself, we felt really close to each other”. My advice to the Applicant was to point all those aspects out to the Probation & Parole Officer and that it would be reflected in the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) that would be relied upon in sentencing. I recall the Applicant commenting that he was relieved to be able to be truthful about the situation and that he would be truthful with the Probation and Parole Officer. I am certain [the solicitor] made contemporaneous notes of these discussions.

I think it was on the morning of the sentencing of 18 July 2013 I received a copy of the PSR which detailed the Applicant’s version which conflicted with his instructions after he had been convicted. [The solicitor] and I arranged for a conference with the Applicant at the Downing Centre court complex as soon as we could.

In that conference, which was also attended by a number of the Applicants “friends”, the Applicant was taken to the substance of the PSR and the conflicting accounts provided by him for that report. The Applicant and a Mr Armfield were particularly critical of myself and [the solicitor] alleging that we had forced the applicant to provide a false account to the Probation & Parole Officer. I told the Applicant that I would be seeking to withdraw before Williams DCJ that morning and that he would need to communicate to Legal Aid NSW to seek to obtain alternate legal representation”.


	
	The solicitor’s affidavit did not refer to the above conversation nor did he give evidence about it. He stated, “I admit that after the verdict that [sic] I advised him to carefully consider his position. At no point while I was instructed by Kees did I ask him to confess to the offending or prepare a confession.”
	
	
	A Pre-Sentence Report dated 8 July 2013 was subsequently prepared by Alan Lyness, Probation and Parole Officer from Taree District Office, which included the following under the heading “Attitude to the Offences:”
	


“Initially when interviewed by this Service the offender denied that he had committed any offences. At a subsequent home visit interview he accepted full responsibility and gave a detailed account of his offending and expressed concern for the effect his offending behaviour may have had on the victim. Some days after this interview, he attended this office and stated that he wanted to retract that account and reiterate the fact that he was innocent of all matters. He stated that the reason he had previously accepted responsibility was based on advice he had received to the effect that the eventual sentence imposed would be more lenient if he was seen to be taking responsibility. Contrition does not appear to be a sentiment that the offender has dwelt [sic] upon given his apparent preoccupation with manipulating a favourable sentencing outcome”


	
	The applicant asserts that his solicitor pressured him to admit that he was guilty for the purposes of the proceedings on sentence. In one of the handwritten documents relied upon by the applicant on his appeal entitled “Account of False events and occurrences,” he asserts that:
	


“The solicitor made up a guilty story for me and rehearsed it with me to give to the Probation officer and gave it to him. I thought about [sic] for a while overnight, the next morning I went back to the Probation officer and told him that I gave him a false statement that was made up by my solicitor and then I told him the real storey [sic] that was the truth and that I, not guilty”


	
	The applicant relied upon the fourth and final page of what is clearly a four-page letter sent to him, presumably after trial, by his solicitor. That page was randomly included in a bundle of documents with no explanation regarding its provenance. The applicant did not provide the previous three pages of the letter. Despite being given the opportunity to go through his papers to locate the rest of the letter, he informed the Court that he could not locate it. The solicitor was also asked to locate it, but he gave evidence that he had moved offices a number of times since this trial and was now retired. He has been unable to locate the applicant’s entire file in relation to this matter.
	
	
	The page the applicant provided to the Court was in the following terms:
	


-4-

That you have accepted responsibility for the offending;

That your relationship with your then partner, Tracey Goodwin, had completely deteriorated and you were very stressed and emotional as a result;

That you are extremely remorseful and regretful for the offending and the distress that was caused to the complaint [sic];

That her attentions were extremely flattering to you;

That you thought that you were being encouraged by her and that your better judgment was overborne;

That you were tempted and could not resist the temptation; and

That you were an adult and should have exercised the appropriate behaviour towards the complainant

For your assistance, I enclose copies of the following documents

Police Facts

Form of Indictment

Criminal Record

Yours faithfully

[Solicitor]


	
	The copy of the document provided to the Court by the applicant had a significant amount of additional handwriting over it consistent with the handwriting of the applicant elsewhere on handwritten documents filed in this appeal, including words such as “Bullshit Storey (sic) I was intimidated to give to Allen my Probation Officer…” etc.
	
	
	It is unfortunate to say the least that the rest of the letter was not made available to the Court by the applicant. In circumstances in which the solicitor has not been able to locate any of his file, the only potential avenue from which the rest of the letter could be sourced was the applicant.
	
	
	There are two inferences that could be drawn from the document “page 4” (putting to one side the additional handwriting). Although the applicant did not expressly make this submission, implicit in his complaint is an assertion that the letter supports his claim that his solicitor made up a story for him to tell the Probation and Parole Officer and recorded the contents of the fabricated story in a formal letter signed by him in his capacity as his solicitor.
	
	
	The alternate inference is that “page 4” is part of a letter sent to the applicant following the trial confirming the conversation the applicant had with counsel to which counsel deposes in his affidavit. That is, that the applicant confessed his guilt and was advised to repeat that confession to his Probation and Parole Officer.
	
	
	Taking into account all of the above I am satisfied that the document “page 4” formed part of a letter confirming the details of the applicant’s conversation with counsel. To the extent necessary in order to deal with this ground of appeal, I reject the allegation made by the applicant that his solicitor and his counsel somehow forced the applicant to tell a false story to the Probation and Parole Officer.
	
	
	Similarly, I am satisfied that the applicant’s lawyers did not put pressure on him to plead guilty. Both the barrister and the solicitor deny this allegation. They both provided evidence that they had given the applicant advice about the implications on sentence flowing from a plea of guilty (being advice they are required to give in all trial matters). Even if they had placed pressure on him to plead guilty, which I do not accept, there is nothing in the transcript to establish that the applicant’s counsel did not do anything but conduct a vigorous and spirited defence to the charges.
	
	
	Having regard to the trial transcript, the thorough cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, in particular the complainant and Ms Goodwin, and the opening and closing addresses on behalf of the applicant and also noting the fact the applicant was in fact acquitted of Count 6, I am satisfied that there is nothing about the way in which the trial was conducted that gave rise to any miscarriage of justice. On the contrary, the applicant’s defence appears to have been conducted in a highly competent manner.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


Good character evidence not introduced


	
	The applicant asserts that statements from numerous community members regarding his “history of good parenting and supervision of their children were not taken into account.” In one of his documents headed “Points of Interest,” he claims he had a “complete file of references.” The only character evidence filed on the appeal by the applicant postdates the trial, being two affidavits of Daniel Armfield dated 10 June 2013 and 31 October 2013 respectively.
	
	
	Both the barrister and solicitor deposed that they were not provided with any of the character evidence now raised by the applicant at the time of the trial. The solicitor deposed that he recalled telling the applicant on several occasions that any persons with evidence should attend his office and provide a statement and that for their evidence to be of any value they would have to be prepared to come to court and be cross-examined about it.
	
	
	Some character evidence was called through the applicant’s daughter S.
	
	
	It is noted that the applicant has a prior conviction for a common assault.
	
	
	The applicant did not give evidence at his trial nor did he participate in an ERISP. Accordingly, any character evidence would in any event have been relevant on the question of propensity rather than credibility: Melbourne v The Queen [1999] HCA 32 at [30]-[31]; 198 CLR 1 at 14.
	
	
	In circumstances where the applicant did not provide any character evidence to his solicitor and/or barrister, it could not be said that the trial miscarried due to the incompetence of his counsel as a result of the evidence not being called. This ground is not made out.
	


The complainant and a Kia car


	
	Although this complaint was not a ground of appeal, in the material provided to this Court there was complaint made that the complainant was not cross-examined about whether she made up the allegations in order to get victims’ compensation and buy new Kia car. In a document headed “Comments of [the complainant] (not cross-examined or produced in court),” a conversation is recounted in which the complainant is alleged to have said to a friend on the telephone in the presence of the applicant, prior to the allegations made, “Really, you can get victim’s compensation for that?” This conversation was said to have taken place after the complainant had told the applicant that she wanted a “new Kia” and got angry when the applicant said he could not afford one.
	
	
	Both the barrister and the solicitor deposed to the fact that this conversation had never been brought to their attention. Consistent with this, it is not contained in the signed instructions provided to his counsel prior to the trial.
	
	
	Whether or not this conversation took place, it was not brought to the attention of counsel, is not fresh evidence and the fact that it was not put to the complainant at trial does not give rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	


Conclusion regarding incompetence of counsel ground


	
	None of the grounds alleging miscarriage as a result of incompetence of counsel have been made out.
	
	
	Grounds 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 are dismissed.
	


Section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act (Grounds 8 and 10)


	
	Grounds 8 and 10 assert that the applicant’s counsel failed to adduce evidence of the complainant’s prior sexual experience as well as statements from previous men in her family whom she had accused of sexual assault.
	
	
	The evidence of both the applicant’s barrister and solicitor is that none of this material was ever brought to their attention.
	
	
	In any event, such evidence would not be admissible by virtue of s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), which provides:
	


(3) Evidence that discloses or implies:

(a) That the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or

(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity,

is inadmissible.


	
	Although exceptions are provided for in s 293(4) and (6) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, there is nothing to suggest that the material would fall into any of those exceptions.
	
	
	Section 293 has been held to preclude cross-examination about previous false complaints: R v M (1993) 67 A Crim R 549; R v Bernthaler (NSWCCA, Kirby P, Badgery-Parker J, Ireland J, 17 December 1993, unreported).
	
	
	Grounds 8 and 10 are not made out.
	


Unreasonable verdicts (Grounds 1, 3, 6 and 15)


	
	Encompassed in these grounds are assertions both that the verdicts were unreasonable and also that the acquittal on Count 6 was unable to be explained and hence the verdicts are inconsistent.
	
	
	To the extent that the applicant complains that the complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated (Ground 3), the requirement of corroboration of the evidence of a complainant has not been necessary for some time: see s 164 of the Evidence Act. It is noted that the trial judge gave a “Murray” direction at the trial: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12; (1987) 30 A Crim R 315.
	
	
	The applicant makes complaint that the complainant did not immediately go to a hospital and be examined in order to obtain forensic evidence (Ground 5). Although this fact made the Crown case weaker, it does not follow that the verdicts were unreasonable. Three of the counts did not involve an allegation that would have necessarily yielded forensic evidence in any event, being three counts of digital penetration.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the fact that the trial judge made an observation at the time of sentencing the applicant regarding his Honour’s reconciliation of the verdict of not guilty on Count 6 with verdicts of guilty on Counts 4 and 5. The applicant relies upon these comments in support of a proposition that the verdicts are inconsistent. His Honour observed the following in his Remarks on Sentence:
	


“It is somewhat difficult to understand the jury’s verdict in regard to count 6. One possibility is that the defence highlighted the lack of forensic evidence such as DNA. Perhaps the jury expected DNA to have been able to have been found even weeks after the event. Another possibility is that evidence was given by Mr Langelaar’s partner that the victim had shouted at her that she had sex with Mr Langelaar in their bedroom and their daughter’s bedroom. His partner also gave evidence that Mr Langelaar had admitted to her on 16 June 2012 that he did have sex with the victim on three occasions, one being in the hallway, one in the pantry and there was another occasion but she could not remember where that place that was mentioned was…

There was no count on the indictment that alleged sexual intercourse in the daughter’s bedroom, the hallway or the pantry although the victim gave evidence that the counts on the indictment were not the only time that she was touched inappropriately.

These varying scenarios may have been sufficient to raise a doubt as to the last count.”


	
	As was noted by the trial judge, in this case there is a proper way to explain the jury verdicts. The principles regarding the question of inconsistent verdicts are well established. In Mackenzie v R [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367. Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ observed the following:
	


“…the respect for the function which the law assigns to juries (and the general satisfaction with their performance) have led courts to express repeatedly, in the context both of criminal and civil trials, reluctance to accept a submission that verdicts are inconsistent in the relevant sense. Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted. If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury.”


	
	Their Honours went on to observe at 368:
	


“Nevertheless, a residue of cases will remain where the different verdicts returned by the jury represent, on the public record, an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty. More commonly, it may suggest confusion in the minds of the jury or a misunderstanding of their function, uncertainty about the legal differentiation between the offences or lack of clarity in the judicial instruction on the applicable law. It is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside. It is impossible to state hard and fast rules. ""It all depends upon the facts of the case"".

The obligation to establish inconsistency of verdicts rests upon the person making the submission”


	
	The relevant test is whether the verdicts are an “affront to logic and common sense” and strongly suggest a compromise of the performance of the jury’s duty. The focus is on any explanation for an acquittal, not a conviction: R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 per Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed) and Raumakita v R [2001] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at 35 per Johnson J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Button J agreed).
	
	
	Having regard to the fact that there are explanations for the verdict of acquittal on Count 6, I am not satisfied that the jury compromised its verdict in relation to Count 6 in any way.
	
	
	As for the other grounds alleging, in effect, that the jury should not have convicted him, I approach this task in accordance with the well-established principles in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. This Court is required to examine all of the evidence and determine whether upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The relevant principles were recently re-stated by this Court in Elwood v R [2016] NSWCCA 18 by Meagher JA (with whom McCallum and Button JJ agreed) as follows:
	


“21 The question for this Court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the applicant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in other words, “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the applicant’s guilt”: Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] (Hayne J, Gleeson CJ and Heydon J relevantly agreeing), citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492-493.

22 In answering that question the Court has to make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. In doing so, it is required to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses: M v The Queen at 493. Ordinarily a reasonable doubt entertained by this Court would be one which the jury also ought to have experienced, except where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence could have resolved that doubt. The jury’s advantage is diminished but not removed where that evidence is or includes, as it does here, video recordings of police interviews given by the accused. However even where that is so, there remain the advantages identified by McCallum J in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [480], which include, when evaluating all of the evidence, that of having seen other witnesses give any conflicting evidence.”


	
	The complainant gave evidence and was cross-examined. Hers was a cogent account of a relationship between her and the applicant, a much older man whom she regarded as a father figure. The context evidence shows a gradual sexualisation of that relationship. Some of this context evidence was observed by Ms Goodwin and was not disputed, such as that regarding the complainant walking around in her underwear and watching television under a blanket on the couch with her legs draped over the applicant’s lap.
	
	
	Although there was evidence of the complainant’s mental health history and other attacks made on her credit, an examination of the transcript of the evidence she gave at trial as well as the transcript of her interview with police leads me to conclude that there was nothing about her evidence which meant it ought not to have been accepted. When it was put to her in cross-examination that it suited her to make an allegation against the applicant, the complainant said, “There is nothing I need to lie about, nothing. I’m trying to do my HSC, and I’m sitting here talking to you and you’re calling me a liar. I’m not lying about anything. No one wants to be in this position…”
	
	
	The evidence of Ms Goodwin as to admissions made by the applicant, whilst not accepted expressly in relation to Count 6, were nonetheless still capable of being relied upon in general terms. Ms Goodwin was cross-examined vigorously and maintained her version of events. She denied that she had misinterpreted the relationship between the applicant and the complainant.
	
	
	Of particular significance in the narrative was the evidence of the interrupted kiss. Three witnesses gave evidence of this: the complainant, Ms Goodwin and S. Even though the applicant’s daughter S sought to downplay the event in her evidence in court, the fact remains that she saw something that she immediately reported to her mother.
	
	
	Having had regard to all of the evidence, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant’s guilt. These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
	


Conclusion regarding conviction appeal


	
	None of the grounds of appeal against conviction having been established, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	The focus of the applicant’s written submissions and before this Court was on the appeal against conviction. By the time of the applicant’s proceedings on sentence he was represented by different lawyers from those who represented him at trial.
	
	
	Of the 15 grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant, only Ground 4 was referable to the proceedings on sentence:
	


Ground 4:   His Honour at the sentence hearing wrongly stated that I had self confessed when he was accepting a statement made by my ex partner which was not a confession by me to the court


	
	This complaint can be easily dealt with. It is no doubt a reference to the fact that, during the Remarks on Sentence, Williams DCJ referred to the evidence of Ms Goodwin and the confession made to her by the applicant. At no stage did his Honour state that the applicant had confessed “to the court.” No error by his Honour is disclosed in this regard.
	
	
	No other grounds of appeal are relied upon. Nor does the applicant assert that the sentence imposed on him was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced in relation to five sexual assaults on a child. The four offences contrary to s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act carry a maximum penalty of 12 years’ imprisonment and the offence contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment with a standard non-parole periods of eight years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	It is noted that the applicant’s non-parole period expires on 10 November 2016.
	
	
	In circumstances where no grounds of appeal are relied upon, leave to appeal against sentence is refused.
	
	
	I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

2701303,R v Medich (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 1001,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	On 3 September 2009 Michael Loch McGuirk (“the deceased”) was shot and killed outside his home in Cremorne. On 27 October 2010 Ronald Edward Medich (“the accused”) was charged with soliciting to murder the deceased. On 4 November 2010 the accused was charged with murdering the deceased. On 7 June 2013 the accused was further charged with intimidating Kimberley McGuirk, the wife of the deceased.
	
	
	I do not propose to recount the lengthy procedural history of the matter. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that in November 2015 the accused’s trial was listed to commence on 11 July 2016, with an estimate of 3 to 4 months. Between November 2015 and June 2016, a number of directions hearings were held before me with a view to ensuring that the trial would be in a position to proceed on the date on which it was listed.
	
	
	At about 9.55 am on the morning of 11 July 2016, that being the date on which the accused’s trial was to commence, the Crown provided the accused, by way of disclosure, with two large lever arch folders of documents. The accused having been arraigned, and a jury having been empaneled, I adjourned the proceedings until 25 July 2016 so as to allow the accused to read and analyse the material which had been disclosed.
	
	
	Such analysis having been undertaken, the accused has now filed two notices of motion. The principal orders sought by the accused are that:
	



	
	the jury be discharged;
	
	
	the trial be vacated; and
	
	
	the matter be adjourned for further directions, with associated orders being made to facilitate the issue, on behalf of the accused, of a number of Subpoenas.
	



	
	The orders were opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	In support of the orders sought, the accused filed an affidavit of his present solicitor, Robyn Richardson, of 20 July 2016. He also tendered the material disclosed by the Crown on 11 July 2016 which was marked Exh. A. Further, to the extent that it is not otherwise contained in Exhibit “A”, I have had regard to material provided to me on 11 July 2016 when the issue of late disclosure was first raised.
	
	
	The Crown chose not to place any affidavit evidence before the Court in relation to the circumstances which give rise to this application. I must say that I would have been assisted by some direct evidence which established (inter alia) the relevant chronology of events. As a consequence of the absence of any evidence being adduced by the Crown, I have been left to draw such inferences as are available to me from the evidence tendered on behalf of the accused, as to when, and in what circumstances, particular events occurred.
	


THE FACTS


	
	In June 2013 officers of the NSW Police were notified of what I will refer to as “the 2013 incident”. Because of the fact that the accused is yet to come to trial, and mindful of the necessity to take every step to ensure a fair trial for the accused as well as for the Crown, it is not appropriate, nor is it necessary, to set out any detail of that incident. Its significance is probably best gauged by the fact that a specific task force was created to investigate it, independent of that which was set up to investigate the deceased’s murder.
	
	
	It is the accused’s position that the circumstances surrounding the 2013 incident have a bearing on at least one of the principal issues in his trial. The Crown did not appear to dissent from that proposition.
	
	
	Having been made aware of the 2013 incident, officers from the task force commenced to investigate it. That investigation involved (inter alia) interviewing a number of witnesses, and taking a number of statements. Material obtained by the police as a result of that investigation bears dates between July 2013 and December 2014.
	
	
	It was not until about 7 June 2016 that Det. Sheehy (the officer in charge of the investigation of the deceased’s murder) sought legal advice from a Police Prosecutor as to the necessity to disclose material obtained from the investigation of the 2013 incident. Although there is no direct evidence, I infer that the catalyst for seeking advice was the provision to Det. Sheehy, in about early June 2016, of material emanating from the investigation of the 2013 incident. Importantly, Det. Sheehy’s briefing note to the Prosecutor indicates that he was provided with only 3 documents at that time. They were in the nature of log entries and were dated 16 July 2013, 19 December 2013 and 17 March 2014 respectively. Those documents provided what might be described as a very broad overview of the nature of the 2013 incident, and the investigation conducted in relation to it. They formed a small fraction of the entirety of the material which was held by police as a result of the investigation.
	
	
	In the course of the hearing of the present application the Crown Prosecutor informed me:
	


“I am instructed that since 2014 the officers involved in this matter made contact with those officers, indicating to them the importance of finalising the investigation and the advising. In particular they have documented contact … impressing that upon them”.


	
	I accept, based upon what I was told by the Crown Prosecutor, that Det. Sheehy, perhaps along with other officers involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder, took some steps between 2014 and 2016 to obtain, from members of the other task force, material which had been obtained in the investigation of the 2013 incident.
	
	
	Det. Sheehy’s briefing note makes reference to the fact that “in 2013 investigators became aware of (the 2013 incident)”. The reference to “investigators” is to be interpreted as a reference to those (including Det. Sheehy) who were engaged in the investigation of the deceased’s murder. Given that those investigators were aware of the 2013 incident, they must have been aware of its potential impact upon issues which would arise in the accused’s trial. However I accept, on the basis of what I have been told from the Bar table by the Crown, that Det Sheehy and other officers involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder had no direct involvement in the investigation of the 2013 incident.
	
	
	Consistent with that, Det. Sheehy’s briefing note makes reference to the fact that those involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder were “unaware” (as at June 2016) of the “current status” of the investigation into the 2013 incident. Being unaware of the status of an investigation is quite a different thing from being unaware of the nature and extent of evidence obtained in the course of such investigation. The precise extent of Det. Sheehy’s knowledge as at June 2014 (or for that matter, the knowledge of any other officer(s) involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder) of the nature and extent of the material obtained as a result of the investigation of the 2013 incident is not clear on the evidence.
	
	
	On 9 June 2016, Det. Sheehy was advised that a “legal obligation exists to disclose the material … to the Crown and to the accused Medich”. By letter of 23 June 2016, the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to the accused and enclosed the three log entries referred to in [11] above, along with a copy of the opinion obtained from the Police Prosecutor as to disclosure, and a further investigator’s note of 6 March 2014. Clearly, the Crown had been provided with this material by the police at some time between 9 June and 23 June.
	
	
	It is evident that at some time after the advice was provided to Det. Sheehy on 9 June 2016, those police involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder were provided with the entirety of the material obtained in the course of the investigation of the 2013 incident. I am not able to determine exactly when this occurred. The Director’s letter to the accused of 23 June 2016 suggests that the Crown may not have had the entirety of the material in its possession when the letter was written although once again, that is not entirely clear. The Crown suggested from the Bar table that it was not until sometime after 5 July that the Director’s office received the material from the police.
	
	
	In this regard, the Crown Prosecutor informed me in the course of the hearing:
	


“I cannot tell your Honour how many times we have sought that information. We have records of our seeking it. The police in relation to our investigation have been seeking it. We then discovered effectively on Tuesday 5 July that material had been sent to a Police Prosecutor for advice and then coming to us for advice but going to be given to us next week. We sought it to come in immediately. We could not see the material”.


	
	In these circumstances, I enquired of the Crown as to whether what was said to have occurred between 2014 and 2016 (in terms of efforts to obtain the material) was going to be addressed by calling evidence. The following exchange then took place:
	


CROWN PROSECUTOR: … The officer‑in‑charge we sought to have here today to give evidence. The officer‑in‑charge is in the Philippines. His offsider is here if your Honour wishes me to call him.

HIS HONOUR: I am not seeking to run your application, it is not my role, but this is very troubling.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, it is. I would normally seek to call him but I don't think there is an adequate explanation for it. We have been saying that all along, so that we're basically as upset with it as your Honour.


	
	The Crown’s references to the “officer in charge” and his “offsider” were references to officers engaged in the investigation of the 2013 incident. It is inconceivable to think that those officers would not have had some knowledge of the case against the accused, as well as some knowledge of the evidence relied upon to support it. By the end of 2014 they had gathered a significant body of evidentiary material, the nature of which was such that they must have had some appreciation of its impact upon the issues in the accused’s trial.
	
	
	Even in the absence of evidence from the Crown, four conclusions are clear. Firstly, steps were taken by police and the Crown between 2014 and 2016 to get access to the material obtained from the investigation of the 2013 incident. Secondly, the entirety of that material was provided to the police investigating the deceased’s murder a matter of weeks prior to the accused’s trial. Thirdly, the material was provided to the Crown sometime in early July 2016. Fourthly, it was not until about 9:55 am on the morning of 11 July 2016, that being the morning on which the accused’s expected 3 to 4 month trial was listed to commence, that the Crown disclosed the material to the accused for the first time. Precisely why all of this occurred as it did is not explained on the evidence.
	
	
	When I was informed that disclosure had been made to the accused shortly before the commencement of his trial, and for reasons that I expressed at the time, I adjourned the trial for a period of two weeks. In the intervening period counsel for the accused undertook an analysis of the material in Exh. A. Having done so, counsel formed the view that it would now be necessary to undertake further investigations and enquiries in order to properly prepare the accused’s case. Counsel explained that those investigations and enquiries will include the immediate issue of a series of subpoenas. Counsel has also foreshadowed the necessity to make one or more further pre-trial applications as a result of the late disclosure of the material. There is also a possibility that the accused will seek to rely upon notices issued pursuant to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	Those steps do not necessarily represent the limit of the investigations and enquiries which have been rendered necessary as a consequence of the late disclosure of the material to the accused. Counsel has informed me that she will not be in a position to define the limits of any further steps which might be necessary until at least there is initial production of material under subpoena. The production of that material may lead to the necessity to issue further subpoenas. It is also conceivable that there will be claims for public interest immunity by some of the organisations to which it is proposed that subpoenas be directed. It is in all of these circumstances, that an application has been made to vacate the trial.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	Section 15A of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986 (NSW) imposes a duty of disclosure upon law enforcement officers. A duty of disclosure is also imposed upon the Crown, independent of that Act. The interests of justice, and the public interest in the efficient disposition of cases before the court, necessitate careful attention being paid to the duty of disclosure: R v Solomon [2005] SASC 265; (2005) 92 SASR 331 at [116] per Doyle CJ (with whom Duggan and Sulan JJ agreed) cited in R v Lipton [2011] NSWCCA 247; (2012) 82 NSWLR 123 at [92].
	
	
	The material which was obtained in relation to the 2013 incident, and which was finally disclosed to the accused 2016, was available, and apparently in the possession of the police investigating the 2013 incident, on and from December 2014. I am satisfied that it was not provided to the police responsible for investigating the deceased’s murder until sometime in June 2016. It was not provided to the Crown until July 2016. Why that is so is not something I am able to answer on the evidence. However on the basis of what I have been told by the Crown, there is no adequate answer. That, as I observed in an exchange with the Crown, is obviously troubling.
	
	
	On the basis of what I have been told by the Crown from the Bar table, I am satisfied that between 2014 and 2016 there were requests made by the Crown, and by police involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder, to obtain the material. In the absence of any evidence being adduced by the Crown, I am not able to determine the frequency with which those requests were made, the persons by whom they were made, the terms in which they were made, or the terms of any response to them. Accepting that such requests were made, they were obviously directed towards having the material passed over, either to the police involved in the investigation of the deceased’s murder, or to the Crown. Whilst those efforts were laudable in one sense, it follows from the lengthy period over which they were apparently made that it must have been apparent, a very long time ago, that they were not achieving the desired result. What other steps were taken, for example by escalating those efforts so that they were undertaken at an appropriately senior level, is not established. Moreover, any requests made since November 2015 must necessarily have been made with an increasing realisation that the trial date was fast approaching. What, if anything, was done in the face of that increasing realisation to bring the matter to a head is not established on the evidence.
	
	
	What is also troubling, is that these proceedings have come before me for (inter alia) directions on no less than eight occasions since the trial date was set in November 2015. Obviously, the object of case managing the matter in that way was to ensure that the trial would be ready to proceed. Indeed, on several of those occasions I emphasised the need to ensure that there was nothing in the way of any pre-trial issues which would prevent the trial from commencing on the scheduled date. Between November 2015 and June 2016, as the trial judge, I was not given the slightest indication of the existence of some ongoing (but unresolved) issue which had the capacity to impact on the commencement of the trial.
	
	
	Against all of that background, it was not until the morning of the very first day of the accused’s trial, and indeed only a matter of a few minutes before the proceedings commenced on that day, that the material was disclosed to the accused. He had not previously been provided with any of it.
	
	
	The accused’s representatives have now had the opportunity to analyse the material and obtain instructions. The further investigations which counsel has submitted are rendered necessary as a consequence of the late disclosure of the material are set out at [22]-[23] above. I have read the material. Given the nature and extent of it, I am certainly not in a position to conclude that the steps that counsel has submitted are now rendered necessary are unwarranted or lacking a proper foundation. On the contrary, they seem to me to be perfectly reasonable and legitimate forensic steps, of a kind which would be expected to be required in the circumstances I have outlined.
	
	
	The unfairness visited upon the accused as a consequence of the late disclosure of the material will be obvious. He cannot be forced to go to trial in these circumstances. As a result of what has occurred, the trial cannot commence in the immediate future. I am left with no alternative but to vacate it, and discharge the jury. In doing so, I should make it clear that for my part the accused’s trial would have proceeded but for the Crown’s late disclosure of relevant material. It is solely as a result of that, and the consequent unfairness to the accused, that the trial date must be vacated.
	
	
	The adverse effects of any criminal trial being vacated at a late stage, let alone at the time of its scheduled commencement, are many and varied. The efficient management of the Court’s considerable workload requires that trials proceed on time, and that they proceed efficiently. When that does not occur, the Court’s planning is thrown into disarray, the burden of its workload is increased, and its available resources are subjected to additional strain.
	
	
	There are other adverse effects as well. The listing of this trial for a period of 3 to 4 months has necessarily had the effect of “shutting out” other accused persons from obtaining an earlier date for their trials. Moreover, there is an obvious public interest in having trials completed within a reasonable time of the commission of an alleged offence, and the charging of an accused. In the present case, the deceased was killed almost 7 years ago. The accused was charged almost 6 years ago.
	
	
	It is also not without significance that 15 members of the public, by virtue of their empanelment as members of the jury, had expressed a preparedness to give up a not insignificant part of their lives in service to the community. Doubtless, all of them have arranged their personal affairs so as to enable them to serve as jurors in this trial. They have been put to significant and completely unwarranted inconvenience as a consequence of the trial being vacated.
	
	
	Finally, quite apart from the public interest, and irrespective of what might be the ultimate outcome of this trial, the deceased’s family would no doubt wish to have some closure after such a long period. That is something which they will now be denied for a further period of time.
	
	
	Any further observations regarding the completely unacceptable circumstances which have resulted in the vacation of this trial would be superfluous.
	
	
	For the reasons I have expressed, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The jury is discharged.
	
	
	The trial date is vacated.
	
	
	The solicitor for the accused is to file with my Associate, no later than 5:00 pm on 25 July 2016, subpoenas directed to the following:
	



	
	The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (formerly the Australian Crime Commission);
	
	
	The New South Wales Police;
	
	
	The New South Wales Crime Commission; and
	
	
	The Department of Justice (Corrective Services New South Wales).
	



	
	The subpoenas in (3) above are to be made returnable before me on Monday 8 August, 2016 at 9:15am.
	
	
	The matter is listed for further directions before me on Monday 8 August at 9:15am.
	
	
	The non-publication order previously made in these proceedings is varied so as to allow the publication of:
	



	
	this judgment;
	
	
	the proceedings before the Court on 25 July 2016.

		25 July 2016",2016-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701307,Mesterovic v R [2016] NSWCCA 140,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 1 June 2015, the applicant Andrija Mesterovic was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing one count of knowingly taking part in the cultivation by enhanced indoor means and for a commercial purpose of a number of cannabis plants, being not less than the small quantity but less than the commercial quantity, contrary to s 23(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	On 4 June 2015, the applicant was found guilty after a three day trial. On the same day, Frearson SC DCJ recorded a conviction and imposed a two year good behaviour bond, with no conditions, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Relevant facts


	
	On 8 January 2014, officers of the NSW police performed surveillance at an address in Kingsford. At about 3 pm on that day the applicant and Mr Milan Belopoljac approached the front of the premises. The applicant was carrying a plastic bag. The men were seen going through the front gate and moving towards the front door. The front door was out of sight and the men were not seen entering the premises.
	
	
	Nine minutes later both men emerged from the front gate. The applicant was again carrying a plastic bag. They entered a Ford motor vehicle which was registered in the name of the applicant. The vehicle was later stopped by police. The applicant was driving and Mr Belopoljac was in the passenger seat. The car contained various items including a pump, a large quantity of potting mix, a product called “Pot Sox”, tubing, “air stones” and a bag of sausages.
	
	
	A search of the premises at Kingsford revealed 23 cannabis plants and equipment associated with their hydroponic cultivation including irrigation lines, a fan, air filters, multi point electrical outlets, water pumps and fertiliser. Some of the cannabis plants were mature plants. The hydroponic equipment was located in every room except the kitchen and bathroom, such that unless a person entered the kitchen from the back of the house and remained only in that room, he or she would be in a room containing hydroponic equipment. There were cannabis leaves on a bed located in the living room. There were also cannabis leaves in a vacuum sealed bag in the hallway. The vacuum sealed bag was itself placed within another bag. The hallway also contained tubs of potting mix, a pump and a product called “Blossom Blaster”.
	
	
	The search also revealed items linking Mr Belopoljac to the premises. There were medications and documents bearing his name. His fingerprint was on a bottle of whisky. The only piece of evidence found which directly linked the applicant to the premises was his fingerprint on a chin-up bar which was located at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.
	
	
	The Crown called evidence from the police officers who conducted the surveillance and the search. The Crown also called evidence from Mr Robert Bowman, a senior inspector with the Department of Primary Industries and an authorised person under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Mr Bowman gave evidence that there would have been a strong odour of cannabis in the house, particularly from the mature plants, that would have been noticeable in the hallway. The police evidence on this topic was not consistent. Senior Constable Dignan said he could not smell the cannabis in the vacuum sealed bag found in the hallway. Constable Jones gave evidence that she could smell cannabis when she opened the back door. Constable Schofield could not recall any smell. Detective Senior Constable Rodden did not mention odour at all. The trial judge referred to all of this evidence in his summing up.
	
	
	His Honour summarised the Crown’s case as being that the applicant took part in the indoor cultivation of prohibited plants in two ways, either of which was sufficient to prove the offence:
	



	
	by assisting Mr Belopoljac “by driving him to and from the premises in Sturt Street knowing that Belopoljac was there for a purpose connected with the cultivation”; and
	
	
	by knowingly transporting items “knowing that Belopoljac had the items for a purpose connected with the enhanced indoor cultivation”.
	



	
	The applicant was found guilty. In sentencing, his Honour noted the maximum sentence for an offence under s 23(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act of 15 years imprisonment, but found that the present case was at the “very low end of the spectrum”. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant went inside the premises at Kingsford. He found that anyone who went inside would have been overcome by the stench of cannabis. His Honour made specific findings that:
	



	
	the applicant had no criminal record;
	
	
	he was a man of high intelligence;
	
	
	his behaviour was not that of a responsible citizen;
	
	
	he had not expressed remorse;
	
	
	he had good prospects of rehabilitation; and
	
	
	he was otherwise of good character.
	



	
	The primary judge noted defence counsel’s submission that an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was appropriate. His Honour concluded:
	


[W]hen I look at the matter and look at the purposes of sentencing and look at the harm, the menace of drugs in the community, it seems to me that the purposes of sentencing will not be accommodated unless I record a conviction.


	
	His Honour recorded a conviction and imposed a two year good behaviour bond, with no conditions, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The four grounds of appeal (the first three grounds relating to the conviction appeal and the fourth to the sentence appeal) may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	the primary judge gave undue weight to the Crown case and failed properly to describe the applicant’s case in his summing up (Ground 1);
	
	
	evidence concerning the smell of cannabis plants should not have been admitted in circumstances where that evidence had not been foreshadowed prior to the trial (Ground 2);
	
	
	the applicant suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of advice from his barrister that he not give evidence in his own defence (Ground 3); and
	
	
	the primary judge erred in imposing a two year good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (Ground 4).
	



	
	None of the grounds of appeal involves a question of law alone and the applicant must be treated as an applicant for leave to appeal against conviction under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]. The Crown opposes leave being granted. Further, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules imposes a further leave hurdle in relation to the first two grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The Court will return to the question of leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act and Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules at the conclusion of these reasons.
	


Statutory framework


	
	Section 23 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act relevantly provides:
	


23 Offences with respect to prohibited plants

(1) A person who:

(a) cultivates, or knowingly takes part in the cultivation of, a prohibited plant,

...

is guilty of an offence.

(1A) A person who:

(a) cultivates by enhanced indoor means, or knowingly takes part in the cultivation by enhanced indoor means of, a number of prohibited plants which is:

(i) not less than the small quantity applicable to the prohibited plants, and

(ii) less than the commercial quantity applicable to those prohibited plants, and

(b) cultivates, or knowingly takes part in the cultivation of, those prohibited plants for a commercial purpose,

is guilty of an offence.

...

(6) In this section and section 23A, ""cultivating a prohibited plant for a commercial purpose"" includes cultivating the plant:

(a) with the intention of selling it or any of its products, or

(b) with the belief that another person intends to sell it or any of its products.


	
	The applicant was charged in relation to 23 plants, being a number not less than the small quantity but less than the commercial quantity. Accordingly, he was charged under s 23(1A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.
	


Consideration

Ground 1


	
	The applicant submitted that the trial judge impermissibly favoured the Crown’s case during his summing up. The submission is based on a claim that his Honour used 2,543 words in summing up the Crown’s case, compared with 506 words summing up the defence case. He submitted this amounted to “brainwashing” the jury by “repeating one thing after another” to overwhelm the jury with information presented by the Crown.
	
	
	The applicant next submitted that the primary judge failed effectively to sum up the defence case, which was, he submitted, that he did not go inside the premises. The applicant elaborated on this argument in his written submissions:
	


I was standing in front of the doors in the yard, I never entered the premise [sic] and I returned the sausage to the vehicle. Why I did not enter the house is for the following reason: Milan stopped me and told me to wait in front because when he unlocked the door he noticed that the place was robbed (fact); that the place was in a mess, and he realised that if I enter the house I would realise what he was doing. So he told me to wait outside, which I did. Milan came outside shortly after and we went into the vehicle.


	
	The applicant also complained about the following statement of the primary judge during the summing up:
	


The Crown says that the accused knowingly took part in the enhanced indoor cultivation in two ways. The Crown says that the first way is that he assisted Milan Belopoljac by driving him to and from the premises.


	
	The applicant submitted that this “increases my potential level [of] involvement” because there is no evidence of him driving Mr Belopoljac to the premises, only away from the premises.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions on Ground 1 should be rejected.
	
	
	First, this Court has carefully considered the summing up as a whole. It is clear that the trial judge’s summing up did not unfairly favour the Crown. It is difficult to accept that a simple word count comparison of the number of words used in addressing the Crown and defence cases could ever demonstrate error. Such a comparison certainly does not demonstrate error in the present case. It is completely unremarkable that a word count would show that a greater number of words was needed to summarise the Crown contentions in this case where the defence led no evidence. The essence of the applicant’s case at trial was that the Crown had not discharged its onus. In that context, his Honour’s summing up was fair. His Honour repeatedly reminded the jury that the onus was upon the Crown and that the applicant did not have to prove anything.
	
	
	Second, the submission that the applicant “was standing in front of the doors in the yard” and “never entered the premises” was not reflected in the evidence at trial. Nor was such a suggestion made during defence counsel’s closing address to the jury. In effect, under this ground the applicant seeks to put new evidence before this Court through submissions. That approach should be rejected. No application was made to lead this further evidence. Even if an application were made, that application would be rejected. The assertions made at paragraph [18] above bear no relationship to the evidence at trial. The applicant is bound by the forensic choices made at the trial and it is not permissible to advance this very different case on appeal.
	
	
	Third, the trial judge’s statement that the Crown case was that the applicant “assisted Milan Belopoljac by driving him to and from the premises” accurately summarised the Crown’s case. The Crown submitted in closing address that the applicant assisted Mr Belopoljac by “driving him to [the premises at Kingsford]”. Having accepted that he drove Mr Belopoljac from the premises after the visit of nine minutes, and that the Ford motor vehicle in which they were stopped was registered to the applicant, an obvious inference from the available facts, including the surveillance evidence, was that the applicant also drove Mr Belopoljac to the premises. The trial judge’s statement about the content of the Crown case was accurate and occasioned no unfairness to the applicant.
	
	
	Fourth, no complaint was made to the trial judge by counsel appearing for the applicant about any of these matters. Even if the Court were minded to grant leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it would refuse leave to appeal on Ground 1 under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Ground 2


	
	The applicant submits that he suffered prejudice because the Crown introduced crucial new evidence against him during the trial which was not foreshadowed, and that he was not able to meet that evidence.
	
	
	The “new” evidence concerned the strong smell of cannabis plants. Detective Senior Constable Rodden gave evidence concerning the execution of the search warrant on 8 January 2014. She did not mention anything about the smell of cannabis at the premises. Later in the trial, evidence was given by Mr Bowman, a senior inspector with the Department of Primary Industries and an authorised person under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He gave evidence that the odour of cannabis plants is “very, very strong” and that in his experience it emanates from houses after doors are opened.
	
	
	The applicant complains that after Mr Bowman gave this evidence the Crown sought to recall DSC Rodden to give evidence that she did smell cannabis while at the premises. This evidence was described as “very dodgy testimony”. The applicant submits that this was a “fabrication of evidence”.
	
	
	In fact, the trial judge refused to allow DSC Rodden to give this further evidence and upheld the objection by the applicant’s counsel. There is no substance in this aspect of the applicant’s submission.
	
	
	For completeness it is necessary to record that before Mr Bowman had given evidence the Crown had called Senior Constable Dignan, who was also present at the premises on 8 January 2014. When asked whether he could smell the cannabis in the vacuum sealed bag in the hallway he replied, “I could not smell it”. After Mr Bowman gave evidence, the Crown called Constable Jones, who gave evidence that she could smell cannabis when the back door was first opened, and noticed a stronger smell when the bedroom doors were opened. The Crown also called Constable Schofield, who said she could not recall whether she could smell anything at the premises.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that evidence about the smell of cannabis was “crucial” evidence against him. It was referred to a number of times by the Crown and the primary judge during summing up. However, he submitted that the “brief presented by the DPP did not mention anything about the smell”.
	
	
	He submitted that, had the issue been foreshadowed earlier, he could have obtained medical evidence showing that his sense of smell was “affected” more than a decade ago. However, since the issue was first raised at trial, he could not prove this matter in court as he had no medical certificates at the time. The applicant sought to lead further evidence on the appeal on this ground, comprising a medical certificate obtained after the trial which states, in full, that the applicant “has a long history of Chronic Sinusitis which has affected his sense for smelling”. Given the fact that the applicant was self-represented, and the helpful submissions by Ms Noman SC on behalf of the Crown who accepted that the Court should have regard to this material, the Court will permit the tender of the new medical evidence.
	
	
	Ground 2 should be rejected.
	
	
	First, it was clear from a time early in the trial that the Crown was advancing a case that there was a strong smell of cannabis present at the house. If the applicant’s sense of smell was so affected that he would not have noticed the smell of cannabis, this is a matter which would have been relatively easy to prove, via medical evidence or otherwise. As a general principle, parties are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at trial. The new medical evidence that the applicant seeks to adduce, although dated after the trial, was “available”, in the sense of easily obtainable, at the time of the hearing. Given that the odour issue was squarely raised no later than the second day of the three day trial, it was open to the applicant to have obtained and led evidence about any olfactory incapacity.
	
	
	Second, counsel for the applicant referred to the applicant being aware of the strong smell of the cannabis in the house in his final address to the jury. He said:
	


So how is it that in eight minutes Mesterovic knows that Belopoljac is involved in marijuana in there. He says, yes, he went in there and he smelt it. He’s not charged with failing to report a bad smell. He’s charged with knowingly take part in the cultivation of cannabis, and I say there’s no evidence on the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt [italics added].


	
	Third, the new evidence which the applicant tendered on this appeal does not directly address the question of whether the applicant was likely to have smelled cannabis when entering the house. Simply to conclude that the applicant has suffered a long history of chronic sinusitis which has “affected his sense for smelling” is insufficient to address the relevant question of whether the applicant was able to and did smell cannabis at the house.
	
	
	Fourth, there was no complaint made by counsel for the applicant about this issue being raised late at the trial. To the contrary, the issue was squarely addressed by counsel in his address to the jury. Even if the Court were minded to grant leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, it would refuse leave to appeal on Ground 2 under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Ground 3


	
	The applicant submits that on the third day of the trial his counsel advised him not to give evidence. The applicant submits that prior to that date and for about a year or “maybe a bit more” he had been advised by his counsel that he would be giving evidence in his trial.
	
	
	The applicant submits that he suffered prejudice as a result of following the advice of his counsel.
	
	
	Affidavits were read on this issue from Mr Archie Hallas, the applicant’s trial counsel, affirmed 21 June 2016 and Mr Zaki Hajjar, the applicant’s solicitor at trial, sworn 23 June 2016. Each deponent was cross-examined by the applicant in this Court. About the critical issue of the applicant giving evidence at his trial Mr Hallas said in his affidavit:
	


I advised the appellant that if [the conversations that occurred between the police and the appellant when the police stopped his car] were not excluded it may have been necessary for him to give evidence to explain the purpose of the items being in his car.

Given that the conversations were excluded the necessity to give oral evidence diminished. However I advised the appellant of the pros and cons of giving evidence. My solicitor obtained firm instructions that the appellant did not wish to give evidence.

...

Whilst I left the decision to the appellant to give evidence or not, I felt comfortable that he had made the right decision not to give evidence. In my opinion the Crown could not point to any evidence which satisfied the definition of cultivation. Another reason was that I had made an assessment of his demeanour. I had a genuine concern that him giving evidence would advance the Crown case through the manner he may give his evidence.


	
	In cross-examination Mr Hallas largely repeated these matters, although he accepted, perhaps more clearly than appears from the affidavit, that he had advised the applicant for the first time during the trial not to give evidence. In effect, Mr Hallas said that his success in having conversations between the applicant and the police excluded from evidence was the key to the advice. After that ruling, Mr Hallas “didn’t feel it was relevant and necessary for [the applicant] to give evidence”. The evidence of Mr Hajjar took the matter no further.
	
	
	In this Court, the applicant also handed up a statement from Ms Teodora Lazic dated 6 July 2016, which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit 1 on the appeal. In Exhibit 1 she sets out her understanding that she was supposed to be a witness at the trial, but was informed at the last minute that Mr Hallas had decided not to call her. This statement is not directly relevant to the ground of appeal, which concerns Mr Hallas’ advice that the applicant should not himself give evidence. However, Exhibit 1 does support the inference that the applicant seeks the Court to draw that Mr Hallas’ strong advice, given late in the trial, was that the applicant not give evidence in his own defence.
	
	
	In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 Gleeson CJ said:
	


2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of “flagrant incompetence” of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.


	
	In the present case, accepting everything that the applicant says about the timing and content of Mr Hallas’ advice, there was no flagrant or demonstrable incompetence or any other matter involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	There was an obvious balance of possible risks and rewards in the decision by the applicant whether to give evidence in his trial. His counsel may reasonably have thought that the applicant’s case before the jury would have been advanced by him making the positive assertions he made in this Court. Counsel could also reasonably have had regard to the likely outcome of cross-examination by the Crown, and the risk that the applicant’s chances of acquittal would have been harmed. No doubt, counsel was entitled to take into account his assessment of the applicant’s demeanour in giving advice to the applicant about giving evidence. We can discern no error involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice in the advice Mr Hallas gave, which the applicant followed.
	
	
	At the trial the applicant signed a document saying:
	


I acknowledge, confirm & understand what my legal representatives are saying would be the pros & cons of me not giving evidence however, despite what has been said to me by my legal representatives, my instructions are clear in that I do not want to give evidence in my trial.


	
	No doubt that document was signed after counsel had given the applicant advice, which we accept may have been understood by the applicant as “strong” advice, not to give evidence. The applicant has not shown that he suffered a miscarriage of justice by the decision taken not to give evidence at his trial, even assuming that decision was taken after the “strong” advice of his counsel.
	
	
	Ground 3 should be rejected.
	


Ground 4


	
	In relation to his sentence, the applicant submits that an order under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act “would be more appropriate”. He submits that the s 9 good behaviour bond has been “terrible” and that his “life has come to an end” as a result. In particular he submits that the conviction has prevented him from working, since he was previously employed in the casino industry in which “a person simply cannot have a criminal record”.
	
	
	In order to succeed the applicant must identify either error on the part of the sentencing judge or show that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The charge on which the applicant was convicted carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.
	
	
	His Honour’s remarks on sentence disclose no error and the sentence cannot be described as unreasonable or plainly unjust. The trial judge properly had regard to various factors required by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and concluded that, in the circumstances, the purposes of sentencing demanded that a conviction be recorded.
	
	
	The applicant annexed to his submissions various documents which he submitted were relevant to his sentence appeal, being a report from a forensic psychiatrist, a reference letter and various certificates of qualification.
	
	
	Given the acceptance by the Crown that the Court should have regard to the new evidence, it will be admitted in evidence on the appeal, subject to an order under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) regarding the report of the forensic psychiatrist Dr Milorad Sokolovic, that the material in that report be admitted as evidence of what the applicant told the doctor and not the truth of those assertions.
	
	
	Having carefully examined all of the fresh evidence on sentence, none of the documents warrant a different sentence to that which was imposed.
	



	
	The psychiatric report of Dr Milorad Sokolovic establishes that the applicant suffered reactive anxiety and depression following his conviction. This report does not disclose error on the part of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	The certificates relate to courses undertaken in 2010 by the applicant. None of these documents, either alone or together with the rest of the new material, establishes error on the part of the sentencing judge. They simply establish that the applicant has the following qualifications:
	



	
	Master of Business Administration in Casino Management (European University);
	
	
	Certificate in Casino Management (University of Massachusetts Amherst);
	
	
	Gaming Management Certificate Program (G2E Asia);
	
	
	Certificate in Casino Game Dealing (Asia Pacific Gaming Management Institute); and
	
	
	Casino Pit Management Program (Asia Pacific Gaming Management Institute).
	



	
	The reference letter is an undated reference from a business associate commending the applicant as a candidate for a PhD program at an unidentified university. It does not establish error on the part of the sentencing judge.
	



	
	The fresh evidence does not establish a basis for intervention by this Court on sentence.
	
	
	Ground 4 should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	Each of the grounds advanced on this application does not raise a question of law alone. As noted at the outset, leave is required under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	There is no issue of principle raised by any of the applicant’s grounds of appeal. We have nevertheless considered all of the fresh evidence which was tendered and addressed the substance of each of the applicant’s grounds of appeal. Even if leave were to be granted, the Court would reject each of the grounds of the Notice of Appeal. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate that leave to appeal should be refused on all grounds.
	
	
	The order of the Court is:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on all grounds.

2701328,Finch v R [2016] NSWCCA 133,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant was convicted on the following counts:

(1) supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely lysergide (LSD), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMT Act); and

(2) supply of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act.

The LSD was found in both cardboard and liquid form.

The appellant appealed his conviction. His grounds of appeal raised the following issues:

(1) whether evidence concerning cannabis found at the appellant’s premises should have been admitted in circumstances where the appellant was not charged with a cannabis offence (Ground 1);

(2) whether evidence of a police officer as to the method of consumption of LSD in cardboard form should have been admitted (Ground 2);

(3) whether the trial judge erred in directing the jury that the liquid and cardboard containing LSD should be included in the overall weight of the LSD pursuant to s 4 of the DMT Act (Admixtures) (Ground 3);

(4) whether the primary judge erred in failing to direct the jury to determine whether the appellant was in possession of drugs found in different packages separately (Grounds 4 and 5);

(5) whether the primary judge erred in not leaving to the jury alternative charges of “commercial quantity” or “supply simpliciter” (Grounds 7 and 8);

(6) whether the appellant was unable to receive a fair trial without a Crown witness and informant being called to give evidence (Ground 9); and

(7) whether the verdict was unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence (Grounds 6 and 10).

Held (Payne JA, McCallum and Davies JJ agreeing):

(1) The evidence concerning cannabis was admitted without objection as part of a forensic strategy pursued by trial counsel, which strategy was objectively open to him: [101].

(2) Trial counsel did not object to the police officer’s evidence: [109]. Even if counsel had objected, the appellant would still have faced conviction on the same charge for the large commercial quantity of LSD represented by the liquid form of the drug: [112].

(3) LSD diluted in liquid clearly falls within s 4 of the DMT Act: [127]-[132]. In circumstances where the police officer’s evidence (that cardboard impregnated with LSD is ingested) was admitted, the cardboard also falls within s 4 of the DMT Act: [133]-[144].

R v R2 (1990) 19 NSWLR 513; R v SH [2014] NSWCCA 218; 88 NSWLR 1; Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd v Wyeth [2011] FCAFC 132.

(4) No misdirection occurred because neither of the relevant packages contained less than a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. The ground of appeal was based upon an incorrect factual premise: [155]-[157].

Alliston v R [2011] NSWCCA 281; 217 A Crim R 323.

(5) The primary judge was correct not to leave alternative charges to the jury in circumstances where a) there was no individual package of LSD weighing less than the large commercial quantity: [163]; and b) the charge of supply simpliciter did not reflect the real issues in the case or the way the case was conducted and would jeopardise the appellant’s chances of acquittal: [164]-[172].

James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; 253 CLR 475.

(6) Trial counsel embraced the forensic advantages flowing from the informant’s absence. That course was objectively open to him: [191]-[199].

Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; 210 CLR 285; Pratten v R [2014] NSWCCA 117.

(7) Having regard to all the evidence, the verdict was not unreasonable or not supported by the evidence: [205]-[227].

M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124.

Judgment


	
	PAYNE JA: On 4 February 2013 Mr Finch was arraigned in the District Court at Newcastle on an indictment containing the following three counts:
	



	
	supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely lysergide (LSD), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMT Act);
	
	
	supply of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act; and
	
	
	supply of a prohibited drug, namely amphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the DMT Act.
	



	
	Although questions of leave under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules arise in this case Mr Finch will be referred to in these reasons as “the appellant”.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty in respect of all three charges. His case in respect of the methylamphetamine and the LSD was that the drugs belonged to a person referred to in the evidence as “CJ” and he always intended to return the drugs to CJ.
	
	
	Pseudonym orders and orders relating to the identity of CJ were made by the primary judge as follows:
	



	
	the true identity of the Crown witness is to be permanently supressed pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), together with any evidence, submission, discussion, document or information that might facilitate identification of the true identity of the witness; and
	
	
	the publication of the true identity of the Crown witness is to be permanently restricted pursuant to s 7 of the same Act to the pseudonym “CJ”.
	



	
	No application was made to vary or discharge those orders on this appeal.
	
	
	In relation to the LSD, the appellant denied that he knowingly possessed the drug, but admitted that he was aware that he possessed the relevant quantity of methylamphetamine. In relation to both the LSD and methylamphetamine counts, the central plank of the appellant’s case centred upon the “Carey” defence – a reference to R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292.
	
	
	A summary of the Carey defence was provided in Alliston v R [2011] NSWCCA 281; 217 A Crim R 323 at [19] and [28] (per McClellan CJ at CL):
	


The decision of this Court in Carey concerned the circumstance where a person has drugs under their physical control but always intends to return them to the owner or the person reasonably believed to be the owner. If the accused establishes the necessary intention an offence contrary to s 25 cannot be established. In these circumstances the accused will not have the relevant drug(s) in ""his or her possession for supply"". Supply as defined in s 29 of the Act does not ""include the mere return of the drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner"" (Hunt J at p 294).

...

Before a ""Carey defence"" can be sustained, it is necessary for the party raising it to demonstrate that the evidence is capable of proving that the accused's possession of the drugs was merely momentary or transient and that the accused intended to return the drugs to their owner (R v EAS (unreported) NSWCCA 26 July 1990; R v Tuckey (1991) 57 A Crim R 468; R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59). Analogies have in the past been drawn to the concept of bailment (R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78).


	
	The fact that prohibited drugs were located by the police at the appellant’s premises on 1 September 2010 was uncontroversial at trial:
	



	
	so far as the methylamphetamine was concerned, the appellant accepted that he was in possession of the methylamphetamine and the only issue was whether he had persuaded the jury on the balance of probabilities (pursuant to Carey) that the drugs were within his control simply for the purpose of returning them to the true owner, CJ. Specifically, the appellant accepted in relation to the methylamphetamine that he “suspected that the same was prohibited drugs”;
	
	
	so far as the LSD was concerned, it was the appellant’s case that the drugs were physically within his house and that the third party, CJ, had provided the drugs to him. However, the appellant did not know that what he had been given was a prohibited drug, and he intended to return the items in which the LSD was contained to CJ within a short period of time.
	



	
	In relation to the methylamphetamine count, the appellant was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years dating from 25 November 2012.
	
	
	In relation to the LSD count, the appellant was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years dating from 25 November 2013.
	
	
	In relation to the third count (amphetamine), the appellant was found not guilty on the basis that he had been prescribed the drug.
	
	
	The sentence imposed, in total, was nine years with a non-parole period of six years.
	
	
	On 24 November 2014 an appeal on sentence brought by the appellant was dismissed by a Court comprising R A Hulme J (Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing): Finch v R [2014] NSWCCA 278.
	
	
	Mr Finch now appeals against his conviction. No submission was made by the Crown that this earlier exercise of appellate rights in 2014 affected the appellant’s rights in relation to this conviction appeal.
	


The evidence at the trial


	
	As the appellant seeks to set aside the guilty verdict on counts one and two in the indictment as unreasonable or not supported having regard to the evidence, the Court is required, upon the whole of the evidence, to form a view about whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	Accordingly, the relevant facts are set out in much greater detail than would otherwise have been the case in order that ultimately, the Court’s independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality, can properly be understood.
	


The search of Mr Finch’s property


	
	On 1 September 2010 a number of police officers executed a search warrant at the appellant’s home in Pindimar. The officers present were Detective Sergeant Wheatley, Senior Constable Smith, Sergeant Farmer, Detective Hopkins, Senior Constable Woods and Constable Coyle.
	
	
	The police found a number of prohibited drugs in the course of the search. Those items were analysed and, although the analyst’s certificate was not in evidence, DS Wheatley was allowed to give evidence as to its contents without objection. The Crown summarised this evidence in a table tendered by consent as Exhibit 27. It is convenient to reproduce the table here:

	The execution of the search warrant was videotaped by the police. On that videotape the police recorded the various locations where it was alleged that various prohibited drugs were found on the premises (as set out in Exhibit 27 reproduced above). The police recorded the questions that the appellant was asked about those things and recorded the answers that he gave. An edited version of that video recording was played to the jury at the trial. That evidence is summarised below.
	


Items found at Location 1 - Office table


	
	At the start of the search SC Smith asked the appellant whether there was anything in the house that he wished to declare. The appellant first replied “No” but subsequently admitted that there was marijuana in a small green container. He said he owned the container, which was located in the office table. The container contained 22.4 g of cannabis.
	


Items found at Location 2 - behind bookshelf


	
	Police found a container behind the bookshelf containing 18.6 g of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence at the trial that the container was one of the items which belonged to CJ, who had brought it with him on the night of 31 August 2010 to the appellant’s house.
	
	
	During the search, the appellant told the police that the container contained amphetamine, but that he did not know who owned it. He said he knew someone who had left it there, and that he thought it was left there by accident. Later during the search, he said that the methylamphetamine belonged to CJ.
	
	
	At the trial, the appellant said he knew or presumed that the substance in the container was “speed” because it was the same substance that CJ had offered him a few weeks prior. The appellant said he agreed to take the container (and the envelope found in the backpack which is discussed below) from CJ on the night of 31 August 2010 in order to get CJ to leave his home.
	
	
	The appellant said that CJ had asked him to take the container (together with the envelope) to Ayres Rock Roadhouse at 2.30 pm the following day (earlier in the day of the execution of the search warrant). The Ayres Rock Roadhouse was a 10 minute drive from the appellant’s home. The arrangement was that CJ would call the appellant when he was 20 minutes away. A man named Scott Oakley, who was also present at the appellant’s home that night, gave evidence at the trial to the same effect. The appellant said CJ “wore me down”, and he agreed to the arrangement in order to get CJ to leave his home.
	
	
	The appellant said that he never delivered the container (or the envelope) to the Ayres Rock Roadhouse because he never received the call from CJ.
	
	
	The container was sitting on the appellant’s coffee table when the police arrived. The appellant heard the police arrive. He also had security cameras at his home and saw the police on a security monitor in his office. He ran and “tried to hide the container, what I thought was speed, behind a bookcase”. He said he did this because “it was a bad look”.
	
	
	The methylamphetamine was contained in a small plastic container. Two other identical containers were found in other places in the appellant’s home, also containing methylamphetamine.
	
	
	At the trial, the appellant was cross examined about the presence of the identical containers throughout his house. He described the containers as salad dressing containers. He said he had purchased those kinds of containers in packets of eight. However, he denied that the containers containing methylamphetamine belonged to him. He said that the containers were common and he could “see those containers everywhere ... They sell them at every Coles, every Bi-Lo”.
	


Items found at Location 3 – a Backpack


	
	During the search, the appellant said that he thought the backpack belonged to him. He said he had lent it to CJ, who brought it with him on the night of 31 August 2010. When asked at the trial whether he knew the contents of the backpack the appellant said “half-half”.
	
	
	The backpack contained four sheets of perforated cardboard in a white envelope. The cardboard weighed 7.9 g and was impregnated with LSD. During the search the appellant said that the cardboard was “some pictures”. It was put to him that the perforated cardboard contained LSD and the appellant said, “Maybe”.
	
	
	The appellant and Mr Oakley both gave evidence at the trial that the envelope was sitting on the coffee table when they returned to the appellant’s office after leaving CJ alone for 15 minutes. Like the container of methylamphetamine, CJ had asked the appellant to deliver the envelope to the Ayres Rock Roadhouse at 2.30 pm the following day.
	
	
	At the trial, the appellant said he was unfamiliar with LSD but that CJ had given him a piece of cardboard six months before. On that occasion the appellant did not try the cardboard, and forgot about it. The appellant did not recognise the cardboard in the white envelope to be the same as the cardboard CJ had given him before, because it was a different colour. He said he did not think about what might have been contained in the envelope because he was happy that CJ would not be coming back to his house. The appellant gave evidence that he had put the envelope into the backpack.
	
	
	The backpack also contained two containers of pills. One of the containers had the appellant’s name on it. It contained 8.46 g of amphetamine. DS Wheatley said that the analysis indicated that the pills were dextroamphetamine. The defence tendered a prescription in the appellant’s name for dextroamphetamine, as well as a medical report which indicated that the appellant had, in the past, been prescribed dextroamphetamine for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This was the subject of the third count on the indictment, upon which the appellant was acquitted. The appellant also gave evidence that there was a container of Valium in the backpack, and that the Valium belonged to him.
	


Items found at Location 4 - Coffee table drawer


	
	The police found a film canister in a drawer in the appellant’s coffee table. It contained 1.7 g of cannabis. The appellant said he did not know it was there and that he was “not really sure” what it was.
	
	
	The police also found an Extra Mints tin in the drawer. The tin contained cannabis resin and one cardboard tab containing LSD. The appellant identified the cannabis resin as “hash” but did not identify the single LSD tab. When asked “Would that be LSD” the appellant said “I think so ... I’m not quite sure where that came from”. He also said he was not aware of the contents of the tin. The appellant gave evidence that the tin had been in his coffee table drawer for approximately three months.
	


Items found at Location 5 - Ice cream container in laundry


	
	Police searched the appellant’s laundry and found a Bulla ice cream container which contained a number of other items.
	
	
	At the trial, the appellant gave evidence that CJ had arrived at his house on the evening of 31 August 2010 and emptied the contents of a cardboard box onto the coffee table in the office. The appellant said that he observed various bags and containers on the table, including a bag of what looked like foreign currency, pills that he thought contained ecstasy, small resealable bags known as “deal bags”, and straws. Mr Oakley gave evidence that the items on the table were “a handful of containers” and “a couple of sandwich bags”.
	
	
	The appellant described CJ’s cardboard box as “ratty tatty”. Mr Oakley also said that CJ complained that his box was damaged. The appellant gave evidence that CJ asked him for a container that he could put the items into.
	
	
	The appellant told CJ to take one of his ice cream containers. He said the containers usually contained audio fittings which he used for his business. The appellant was an audio technician. Mr Oakley gave evidence that the appellant told CJ to take “one of the ice cream containers that the speaker bits and pieces are in”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that CJ asked if he could hide the container in the appellant’s home. Mr Oakley said that CJ said “I can’t take this with me. I can’t go home. They’re looking for me”.
	
	
	After initially refusing, the appellant consented to CJ hiding the container “out the back somewhere, preferably well over the back fence”. CJ agreed to return at some point in the future to pick it up. Mr Oakley’s evidence was that CJ asked to “leave some stuff with” the appellant, and that the appellant “wasn’t happy about that”.
	
	
	The appellant said he did not know that CJ had left the ice cream container in the laundry. He did not ask CJ where he left the ice cream container.
	
	
	The appellant said that the contents of the ice cream container belonged to CJ, and that he did not know for a fact what anything in the container was. It was put to the appellant that the fact that he had asked CJ to hide the container was an indication of what he thought was inside it. The appellant said “nothing would have surprised me”. He was asked whether he had any suspicions about what the container was likely to contain. He said:
	


I had seen CJ with things and he offered me different things over the course of time that I knew him, but I’d never seen anything in amounts that big before.


	
	In the ice cream container a smaller white container containing three resealable bags and two ampoules was found. During the search, the appellant told police that he did not know the ice cream container was there, but that he could tell what was in it.
	
	
	Two of the resealable bags contained tablets and one contained powder or crushed tablets. Together these bags contained 47 g of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	During the search, the appellant first told police that he did not know what was in the bags. He then told police “That would be some ecstasy pills” and that he thought the powder was crushed ecstasy pills.
	
	
	At the trial, the appellant gave evidence that the pills belonged to CJ. He said that after CJ had tipped the contents of the cardboard box onto the table he had observed what he thought were ecstasy pills.
	
	
	The white container found within the ice cream container also contained two ampoules. The liquid in the ampoules, including the LSD, weighed 3.5 g. The appellant said that he thought the ampoules contained mouthwash.
	
	
	The ice cream container also contained a transparent plastic bag containing sheets of perforated cardboard impregnated with LSD. The cardboard, including the LSD, weighed 26.5 g. The appellant’s left thumbprint was found to be on that plastic bag. The appellant gave evidence at the trial that CJ had brought the plastic bag to his house. The appellant thought the bag contained foreign currency, and he picked it up to feel its thickness and look at it more closely.
	
	
	DS Wheatley gave evidence that the street value of all the cardboard LSD tabs found at the appellant’s home, being 4,870 tabs (the majority of which were found in the ice cream container), was roughly $73,000.
	
	
	The ice cream container also contained ampoules in two transparent plastic bags. The ampoules contained 63.6 g of liquid which included LSD. The weight of the ampoules was excluded from the calculation of the weight of the liquid.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence at the trial that the ampoules appeared to be mouthwash, and he did not know what was really inside them. He first said that he did not actually see those ampoules (that is, the ones in the transparent plastic bags) when CJ tipped the contents of the cardboard box onto the table, but that they “could have been underneath”. He later gave evidence that he definitely saw a few of the ampoules.
	
	
	The police also found a white straw, with a red line down the middle, in the ice cream container. The straw was similar to a straw that was found in the backpack. The appellant gave evidence that “back in my early trucking driving days when I was in that industry, [I had] seen people using similar things to snort powders”.
	
	
	The police also found in the ice cream container the business card of Matthew Bain, an acoustics technician who was a business acquaintance of the appellant.
	


Items found at Location 6 - Bedroom


	
	The police searched the appellant’s bedroom and found 0.37 g of methylamphetamine and 11.2 g of cannabis. The appellant said that the methylamphetamine was a gift from CJ prior to the night of 31 August 2010.
	
	
	Police also found a note on which the following was written: “Hey Finchey, called into your place B4 I picked boys up at FOOTY. I saw Andy, needed $30 for fuel and food. I’ll pay $200 Thursday. Thanks, XO”.
	


Other Items located in the search


	
	Police found a number of pieces of paper and notebooks in the appellant’s office during the search. Names and numbers were written on these papers. On one of the pieces of paper was written “1 g”. On another was written “1/8 ball”. DS Wheatley said that the term “eight ball” was an expression he had come across when investigating drug matters, and that it signified one-eighth of an ounce of a substance.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that the papers referred to hours worked or quotes that he had given. He denied that any of the entries or documents related to the sale of any drug referred to in the indictment. He said that the reference to a “1/8 ball” was a reference to an eight ball of speed he had purchased from CJ, and that he owed CJ for it.
	
	
	The police also searched the appellant’s roof and found a small set of scales and a number of clear plastic resealable bags. The appellant said that he was not aware that the scales or the bags were in the roof. He could not say whether he had put them there or not.
	


The evidence concerning “CJ” and the events leading up to the search


	
	It is convenient now to summarise the evidence given, principally by the appellant and corroborated by Mr Oakley, concerning CJ and the events leading to the search on 1 September 2010.
	
	
	CJ was an acquaintance of the appellant’s. On 27 August 2010 CJ was charged with drug offences after police found cannabis plants and dried cannabis on his premises. He was taken into custody but granted bail. After the date of the search but before the date of the appellant’s trial, he was convicted.
	
	
	On 1 September 2010 (the day the police executed a search warrant upon the appellant’s property) CJ was on bail. He attended a police station and provided police with information about the appellant. DS Wheatley agreed that as a consequence of information provided to the police by CJ the police went to the accused’s premises on 1 September 2010. The jury was told that at CJ’s sentencing the police provided what is colloquially described as a letter of comfort which resulted in CJ receiving a discount on sentence, according to the magistrate, of some 45 to 50 per cent of what he would have otherwise received.
	
	
	CJ was not mentioned in the original police brief served on the accused. DS Wheatley said the first party to “publicly” mention CJ’s name was the defence.
	
	
	CJ provided a statement to police dated 1 September 2010. That statement was made available to the defence. In that statement CJ said that the cannabis that was found on his property belonged to the appellant; that the appellant had sold CJ cannabis; that the appellant had “ice”, ecstasy and LSD on his premises; that some of these drugs were hidden; and that the appellant had a firearm for use in his “drug business”. CJ made a subsequent statement dated 8 June 2012 in which he denied that the prohibited drugs found at the appellant’s house belonged to him. That statement was also made available to the defence.
	
	
	A subpoena to attend to give evidence was issued requiring CJ to give evidence at the trial. SC Smith gave evidence that he made four attempts to serve CJ with that subpoena. He said that CJ’s property was a rural property, that he could have climbed over the gate, but did not. He also made various attempts to contact him on his mobile phone (he did not have a landline number for CJ).
	
	
	No application was made by counsel appearing for the appellant for a temporary or permanent stay of the proceedings to attempt to ensure CJ’s attendance to give evidence. No complaint regarding CJ’s absence was made by the appellant’s counsel to the jury and no application for any specific direction regarding CJ’s absence was made to the primary judge.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that he had known CJ since 2008 and that they had a friendly relationship. CJ had stayed at his home on four or five occasions. The longest he had stayed was three nights.
	
	
	The appellant said that CJ supplied him with drugs. He said that in September 2010 he was using cannabis daily and methylamphetamine approximately once a week, and that he obtained these drugs from CJ.
	
	
	The appellant said that he had attended CJ’s home three weeks before 1 September 2010. CJ had offered him methylamphetamine on the end of a knife, which he accepted. He and CJ had shared some cannabis provided by CJ. Mr Oakley was also present on that occasion, and he gave evidence that he saw cannabis and “speed” at CJ’s home.
	
	
	The appellant said that CJ had been at his home in Pindimar from 10 pm on 31 August until 3 am on 1 September. Mr Oakley was also there. Mr Oakley and the appellant both said that Mr Oakley was helping the appellant prepare his tax return.
	
	
	The appellant said that when CJ arrived he was “fairly worked up”. The appellant also described CJ as “unstable”. Mr Oakley described CJ as “frantic”.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that CJ said that he had just been released from gaol and had driven to the appellant’s house at approximately 200 km per hour. He said police had raided his house, taken away his cannabis and shot his dog. He said that if his dog died he would “shoot those coppers”, and that he had a rifle hidden under the chassis rails of his car. Mr Oakley’s evidence was consistent with the appellant’s evidence.
	
	
	The appellant gave evidence that CJ said he was scared that the police were looking for him and asked to stay at the appellant’s home. CJ accused him of telling the police about his cannabis, and asked the appellant if he was wearing a wire. Mr Oakley said that CJ said to the appellant “I was dobbed in by the cops. Was it you? It must have been you”.
	
	
	As described at paragraphs [30] and [38]-[39] above, the appellant and Mr Oakley both gave evidence that CJ had arrived with a cardboard box and a backpack. He emptied the cardboard box onto the coffee table in the appellant’s office. Mr Oakley also gave evidence at the trial that CJ had arrived with a cardboard box and “knapsack”, and that he emptied the box onto the appellant’s coffee table.
	
	
	The appellant and Mr Oakley then went to the living room to print some documents relating to the appellant’s taxation return, because that is where the appellant’s computer was located. They were gone for approximately 15 minutes. When they returned, there were three items on the coffee table:
	



	
	a small salad dressing container (the container containing methylamphetamine that the appellant was trying to hide behind the bookshelf at the time the police executed the search warrant);
	
	
	a white envelope (found during the search in the backpack); and
	
	
	a Bulla ice cream container (found during the search in the laundry).
	



	
	The appellant and CJ had a conversation about the items on the table. As a result of that conversation CJ left all three items at the appellant’s house. The appellant gave evidence that they arranged that the appellant would deliver the small container and the envelope to the Ayres Rock Roadhouse the following day. CJ would return at some unspecified point in the future to collect the Bulla ice cream container. Mr Oakley said that, at that stage, he and the appellant left CJ alone again. CJ left between 3 and 3.30 am on the morning of 1 September 2010.
	


Other evidence at trial


	
	Other than the police evidence described at length above and the evidence of the appellant and Mr Oakley summarised above, the remaining evidence was in a narrow compass.
	
	
	Mr Holston, a friend of the appellant, gave evidence that the appellant had never supplied him with any kind of drug, but that CJ had offered him drugs twice. The first time was at the Karuah pub, where CJ offered him cannabis. Mr Holston went back to CJ’s home, where CJ offered him white powder and a sheet of cardboard, which CJ said was “trips”, which Mr Holston thought was “an acid trip”. At that time, CJ did not discuss payment. The second time was at the pub, but Mr Holston simply said “No”.
	
	
	Mr Hunter also gave evidence. His nickname was Muff or Muffman (because he worked with exhausts and mufflers). The word Muff appeared in the appellant’s papers which were in evidence. Mr Hunter said that he had done work for the appellant in 2010 or 2011. He said he did not render a bill for his work, but rather wrote it down on a piece of paper which he gave to the appellant. He said the appellant owed him $1,100 or $1,200, and that he did not owe the appellant any money.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
	



	
	Ground 1: The video evidence concerning cannabis should not have been shown to the jury;
	
	
	Ground 2: The evidence given by Detective Sergeant Wheatley should not have been admitted;
	
	
	Ground 3: Neither the cardboard nor the liquid containing the LSD should have been included in the overall weight of the LSD;
	
	
	Ground 4: The primary judge erred by not directing the jury to first determine what drugs were in the appellant’s possession;
	
	
	Ground 5: The primary judge erred by directing the jury to include the drugs found in the backpack and the ice cream container together;
	
	
	Ground 6: The verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence;
	
	
	Ground 7: The primary judge erred by removing the alternative charge of “commercial quantity”;
	
	
	Ground 8: The primary judge erred by not having the alternate charge of “supply simpliciter”;
	
	
	Ground 9: The appellant was unable to receive a fair trial without the police informant being there to give evidence; and
	
	
	Ground 10: The issues mentioned above “tainted” the appellant’s trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
	



	
	The appellant also identified two grounds of appeal related to his sentence, but those grounds were abandoned prior to the hearing of this appeal.
	
	
	At the hearing of this appeal the appellant sought leave to raise a further ground concerning the alleged incompetence of defence counsel at trial. Leave is required for the appellant to rely upon a further ground of appeal. The issue of whether leave should be granted is addressed below. This further ground of appeal is referred to as proposed Ground 11.
	
	
	At the outset, the Crown took the point that leave was required for each ground of appeal pursuant to s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act which provides:
	


1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court:

(a) against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and

(b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person’s conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, ...


	
	The grounds of appeal in the present case do not involve a question of law alone. In particular, the question of whether a verdict is unreasonable is not a question of law alone: Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 per Johnson J (Basten JA and R S Hulme J agreeing); Krishna v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 318; 178 A Crim R 220. The appellant must be treated as an applicant for leave to appeal against conviction under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act: RWB v R [2010] NSWCCA 147; 202 A Crim R 209.
	
	
	The decision about whether leave to appeal ought to be granted involves an assessment of whether the ground relied upon is reasonably arguable. Having regard to the fact that the issues raised in the grounds of appeal warrant consideration by the Court, in my view it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave to appeal in this case. This does not mean, of course, that with respect to those grounds where the appellant raises matters that were not raised at trial leave will also be granted following consideration of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	The Crown submits that leave should be refused under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. This is a matter to be determined when addressing those specific grounds.
	


Statutory framework


	
	Before considering the grounds of appeal it is necessary to set out the statutory framework that applies in the present case.
	
	
	Section 25 of the DMT Act relevantly provides:
	


25 Supply of prohibited drugs

(1) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

...

(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.


	
	Section 29 of the DMT Act relevantly provides:
	


29 Traffickable quantity - possession taken to be for supply

A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless:

(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply, or

(b) except where the prohibited drug is prepared opium, cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, cannabis resin, heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine or any other acetylated derivatives of morphine, the person proves that he or she obtained possession of the prohibited drug on and in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, midwife practitioner, dentist or veterinary practitioner.


	
	Pursuant to Schedule 1 of the DMT Act:
	



	
	a traffickable quantity of LSD was 0.003 g;
	
	
	a large commercial quantity of LSD was 2 g; and
	
	
	a traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine was 3 g.
	



	
	“Possession” requires that the person has physical custody or control of the prohibited drug: Director of Public Prosecutions v Brooks [1974] AC 862. Furthermore, the person must have knowledge of the existence of the drug in his custody or control: He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523. It is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the accused believed that there was a significant or real chance that there was a prohibited drug in his or her possession: R v Lau (1998) 105 A Crim R 167. However, it is not necessary to prove that the accused knew that he or she possessed a particular prohibited drug: R v Dunn (1986) 32 A Crim R 203. The Crown bore the onus of proving these matters beyond reasonable doubt in relation to both the LSD and the methylamphetamine charges.
	
	
	In relation to the LSD charge, the Crown also bore the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew or believed that the amount of LSD in his possession was not less than a large commercial quantity, or that he was aware that there was a significant or real chance that it was not less than a large commercial quantity.
	


Ground 1: The video evidence concerning cannabis should not have been shown to the jury


	
	At the outset of the trial, an edited portion of the video evidence of the execution of the search warrant at the appellant’s residence was played to the jury. That edited portion of the video contained references concerning the appellant’s cannabis possession.
	
	
	The appellant submits that video evidence concerning cannabis should not have been shown to the jury since he was not charged with an offence related to cannabis. He submits that the video evidence relating to cannabis did not satisfy the relevance test contained in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) because it could not rationally affect the jury’s “decision making process” with respect to the methylamphetamine and LSD charges. He further submits that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, such that the primary judge should have refused to admit it pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant at the trial made a forensic decision that the video containing references to evidence concerning the appellant’s cannabis possession should be shown to the jury. An objective examination of the course adopted by counsel for the defence reveals that it was open to conclude that the evidence was useful in constructing the defence case. Counsel said, in terms, that the cannabis was important to establishing the appellant’s link to CJ (because the cannabis was supplied by CJ) and that is the reason he did not object to the evidence. Counsel referred to the appellant’s cannabis use in his opening address to the jury.
	
	
	It is clear that there were other aspects of the video evidence that defence counsel did object to, which resulted in an editing process that is referred to numerous times in the transcript. Defence counsel had ample opportunity to object to the video evidence relating to the cannabis, but made a forensic decision not to do so.
	
	
	At the time the video evidence concerning the cannabis was shown the jury, the primary judge pointed out that there was no charge relating to cannabis. However, he directed the jury that there was “[o]bviously ... some relevance” to the video evidence the jury was being shown (and the attending evidence of DS Wheatley regarding the quantity and packaging of the cannabis).
	
	
	In evidence, the appellant also admitted to previously supplying small amounts of cannabis. The primary judge also directed the jury that they were not entitled to draw adverse inferences from that admission for the purposes of determining the methylamphetamine and LSD charges.
	
	
	Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides:
	


No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.


	
	This is a clear case where the relevant video evidence was admitted in evidence as part of a deliberate forensic strategy being pursued by counsel for the appellant, which strategy was objectively open to him. No objection was taken to the evidence because it was an important step in the appellant being able ultimately to submit to the jury that the appellant and CJ had a sufficiently close connection which explained why the appellant would allow CJ to store methylamphetamine and LSD at the appellant’s premises for a brief period, without necessarily implicating the appellant in the possession or supply of those drugs.
	
	
	In those circumstances, leave to appeal should be refused under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in relation to Ground 1.
	


Ground 2: The evidence given by Detective Sergeant Wheatley should not have been admitted


	
	This ground of appeal was expressed to apply to all of DS Wheatley’s evidence. However, the appellant’s written submissions addressed only the admissibility of DS Wheatley’s evidence as to the method of consumption of cardboard impregnated with LSD.
	
	
	The Crown called DS Wheatley to give evidence on day two of the trial. A voir dire occurred before the jury heard DS Wheatley’s evidence. It is apparent from the transcript of the voir dire that the witness was called to supplement a written statement dated 23 April 2012. That statement was provided to the primary judge. Another statement, dated 2 September 2010, became Exhibit 1 on the voir dire.
	
	
	In his statement of 23 April 2012 DS Wheatley expressed an opinion that the street value of each of the cardboard squares of LSD (being a discrete dosage unit) was $15. A “discrete dosage unit” is a term which has a specific statutory definition. It is not clear whether DS Wheatley was using the term in its statutory sense, or simply to mean a unit manufactured for consumption. DS Wheatley also expressed an opinion that a discrete dosage unit of the liquid form of the drug was also $15. The purpose of the voir dire was to establish whether DS Wheatley possessed sufficient expertise to express opinions regarding the “street value” of the drugs. Defence counsel submitted that “there’s nothing in [DS Wheatley’s] statement that suggests he has had any dealings with LSD”.
	
	
	In relation to the issue of expertise, DS Wheatley gave the following evidence (on the voir dire):
	



	
	a discrete dosage unit of liquid LSD is “usually .002 mil”;
	
	
	LSD is “usually already impregnated in the card”;
	
	
	he had been involved in approximately 50 LSD cases over the course of his 22 year career (later, in the presence of the jury, he said he had been involved in 20 LSD cases in his 24 year career);
	
	
	his expertise in relation to the value and method of manufacture of discrete dosage units was derived from evaluating intelligence reports and interviewing and debriefing users and suppliers;
	
	
	he had never charged anyone for manufacturing LSD;
	
	
	it had been explained to him (by users and suppliers of the drug) that liquid LSD is sprayed rather than dropped onto the cardboard;
	
	
	the normal purity for liquid LSD was 0.2 per cent. This, he said, was based on his experience with other charges, and on an analyst’s certificate;
	
	
	he had been involved in “probably two, two or three” cases involving liquid LSD; and
	
	
	he was extrapolating from his knowledge derived from cases involving cardboard impregnated with LSD and using that as the basis for his knowledge relating to liquid LSD.
	



	
	At the conclusion of the voir dire, defence counsel said “I concede ... [t]hat he has some experience” in relation to the LSD applied to cardboard. The primary judge ruled that DS Wheatley could provide opinion evidence as to the value of the cardboard LSD, but not as to the value of the liquid LSD.
	
	
	The following exchange subsequently took place in the presence of the jury:
	


Q: Does lysergide have a common name?

A: Yeah it does. LSD.

Q: Those sheets – or sheet containing perforated cardboard. Is that right?

A: That’s correct.

Q: How big is each individual unit, if I could use that expression?

A: Very small. 5 mil by 5 mil.

Q: So we have got cardboard and that contains, apparently, LSD. How does that work? What is the configuration of it or how is it—

A: The drug is impregnated into the cardboard. So to use it, you swallow the cardboard piece [emphasis added].


	
	No objection was taken to that evidence and no complaint was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial about it.
	
	
	In this Court, the appellant submits that DS Wheatley should not have been permitted to give evidence as to how LSD (in cardboard form) is consumed. He submits that only a forensic toxicologist would be so qualified.
	
	
	The context in which this evidence was given, and the failure of the appellant’s counsel to object to it, is important. The appellant faced a single charge of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of LSD. The quantity of LSD in liquid form found at his premises alone was sufficient to amount to a large commercial quantity.
	
	
	Assuming that a successful objection was taken to DS Wheatley’s evidence about the consumption of LSD via cardboard tabs, and that the Court concluded that the cardboard impregnated with LSD was not sufficient to amount to a large commercial quantity (which argument is addressed in dealing with Ground 4 below), the appellant would still have faced conviction on the same charge for the large commercial quantity of LSD represented by the liquid ampoules of the drug found at his house.
	
	
	In circumstances where the appellant’s case at trial was that he had no knowledge of the existence of the LSD found at his house at all, and his principal answer to the charges was a defence based on Carey, objectively, a forensic choice was available to counsel not to challenge DS Wheatley’s evidence about the method of consumption of the cardboard tabs. This was because, regardless of the outcome of that objection and any subsequent ruling about the cardboard tabs impregnated with LSD, the appellant would still have faced conviction on the same charge.
	
	
	If this was a case where objection to the evidence had been taken, difficult questions of admissibility of the evidence would arise. The present evidence was not evidence of something DS Wheatley had seen, heard or perceived (although there may perhaps be cases where a police officer could give evidence of the consumption of LSD in cardboard form as a result of direct observation).
	
	
	The evidence may have been admissible under either ss 78 or 79 of the Evidence Act, but formidable hurdles would have needed to be overcome. This evidence was not a matter admissible under s 144 of the Evidence Act. These questions were not explored by either party at the trial or on the appeal, no doubt because of the forensic choice made by counsel for the defence, which was objectively open to him. Any definitive answer to these questions should await a case where the issue arises squarely.
	
	
	For these reasons, leave to appeal should be refused under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in relation to Ground 2.
	


Ground 3: Neither the cardboard nor the liquid containing the LSD should have been included in the overall weight of the LSD


	
	This ground of appeal addresses whether the primary judge erred in directing the jury that both the cardboard tabs impregnated with LSD and the liquid containing LSD fell within s 4 of the DMT Act. That section provides:
	


4 Admixtures

In this Act, a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture, extract or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug.


	
	Section 3 provides an inclusive definition of the word ""substance"":
	


“substance” includes preparation and admixture and all salts, isomers, esters or ethers of any substance and all salts of those isomers, esters and ethers.


	
	After DS Wheatley gave evidence that cardboard LSD was swallowed, the following exchange took place in the absence of the jury:
	


HIS HONOUR: ... I’ll have to tell the jury about the admixture provisions, which as far as I can work out incorporate the LSD on the cardboard.

PICKIN: I was wondering about that and whether or not that was—

HIS HONOUR: It says “a substance that contains a prohibited drug”. Substance, cardboard, contains a prohibited drug, LSD.

PICKIN: Given that the officer said it was swallowed, which surprised me because I thought it was just sucked and spat out, but given that he said that and I didn’t challenge if, it seems that probably is an admixture [emphasis added].


	
	The primary judge directed the jury that it was not necessary for the purposes of deciding if a large commercial quantity of LSD was engaged to determine the purity of the active drug in either the cardboard or the liquid form:
	


You look at the cardboard squares and you presume that was entirely [LSD]. You look at the liquid in the vials and you treat that as though it was all [LSD].


	
	No application was made by counsel for the defendant for any re-direction.
	
	
	The appellant submits that:
	


Because the liquid is intended to be evaporated before the use of the [LSD], and because the cardboard is not intended to be swallowed neither the cardboard, nor the liquid that the [LSD] is diluted into should be considered as admixture [sic] for the purpose of [s 4 of the DMT Act].


	
	Dealing firstly with the question of the liquid containing LSD. The appellant submitted that the liquid with which the LSD was mixed was not a “substance” containing LSD because, it was asserted, a user would intend that the liquid would be dried or evaporated from the cardboard as part of the process of impregnating the cardboard with LSD.
	
	
	DS Wheatley gave evidence (on the voir dire but not before the jury) the liquid is ""dripped"" onto cardboard or that it was ""sprayed"" onto the cardboard. There was no evidence concerning evaporation or the extent to which the cardboard would absorb the liquid.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant at the trial did not explore this issue or make any complaint about the trial judge’s direction.
	
	
	Even if it were assumed, for the purposes of argument, that the appellant’s suggestion about the method of using liquid LSD is correct, a large commercial quantity of LSD was engaged and it was unnecessary to determine the purity of the active drug in the liquid form it was found in.
	
	
	This is because the text of s 4 of the DMT Act (read together with s 3) makes clear that LSD diluted in a liquid is either a “preparation”, an “admixture” or an “other substance” and thus a prohibited drug since “a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture … or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug”.
	
	
	The clear legislative policy of s 4 is that the purity of a prohibited drug is irrelevant, including for the purposes of the “traffickable” and “large commercial” thresholds contained in DMT Act.
	
	
	This may be contrasted with the position in relation to drug offences under s 312.1(a) of the Criminal Code (Cth), pursuant to which the quantity of the pure form of the controlled drug may be calculated.
	
	
	In R v R2 (1990) 19 NSWLR 513 at 517 Gleeson CJ said (Smart and McInerney JJ agreeing):
	


In the second reading speech upon the introduction of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s 4 was explained in the following manner (New South Wales Parliamentary Debates, 26 November 1985, 10613 at 10616):

“Another problem which is overcome in the Bill is the question of mixtures of drugs, such as heroin, with other non-prohibited substances. Drugs which have been ‘cut down’ or mixed with other substances are treated for all purposes and provisions under the Bill, as if the drug was pure. This is important when the amounts which are set out in the Schedule to the Bill are considered.”

I answer the question in the case stated as follows:

“Q. Does s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 as amended apply to every provision of the Act including both the definition of traffickable quantity contained in s 3 and the deeming provision contained in s 29?

A. Yes.”


	
	The appellant’s submission strains the ordinary meaning of the words used in s 4. To accept the appellant’s submission would be to incorporate into s 4 an additional requirement that a “preparation”, an “admixture” or a “substance” containing a prohibited drug needs to be ingested in the form that it is found before s 4 can apply. If, for example, a particular prohibited drug must be heated or distilled before it can be ingested, s 4 would nevertheless apply, including for the purposes of the “traffickable” and “large commercial” thresholds contained in DMT Act to the drug in its unheated or undistilled (and thus less pure) form.
	
	
	Having determined that the liquid LSD falls within the ambit of s 4 of the DMT Act, there was sufficient LSD in liquid form to support count one in the indictment - 63.6 grams – well over the threshold for a large commercial quantity of LSD.
	
	
	Turning then to the cardboard squares, leave should be refused to the appellant to take a different course to the forensic decision made by his counsel about the ingestion of the cardboard tabs, which course was objectively open to him.
	
	
	In circumstances where that evidence about the ingestion of the cardboard tabs by end users was admitted, without objection, cardboard impregnated with LSD is clearly a “preparation” or an “other substance” within the meaning of s 4. That is, having regard to the evidence that users take the drug by ingesting the cardboard impregnated with LSD, it is clear that the cardboard is an “other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug” and the weight of the cardboard is to be included in calculating the relevant weight for the purposes of the “traffickable” and “large commercial” thresholds contained in DMT Act.
	
	
	Before leaving this topic, something should be said about the way the matter was addressed in submissions in this Court, which each focussed on the legal effect of s 4 on the assumption that the evidence of how LSD is taken by a user was different to the evidence in this case; that is that LSD in this form is ingested by placing a cardboard tab under the tongue and, once the LSD had been ingested, spitting the cardboard out.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it was submitted that the cardboard tab was analogous to a syringe or other delivery mechanism and could not be taken into account in calculating the weight of an “admixture” as defined.
	
	
	The Court was taken to a District Court decision in which the evidence about ingesting LSD was as I have described immediately above (i.e. placing the tab under the tongue and spitting the cardboard out). In that case the view was expressed that:
	


It seems to me as a matter of statutory construction that it cannot be said that the prohibited drug which is within the cardboard square that the paper is contemplated within the legislation to be a substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug [sic]:

R v SH, Jeffreys DCJ, 2 June 2014.


	
	On appeal, in R v SH [2014] NSWCCA 218; 88 NSWLR 1 at [28]-[31] Macfarlan JA said that the critical question was:
	


... whether cardboard containing an unascertained proportion of a prohibited drug listed in Schedule 1 to the Act embedded within its fibres is capable of being a ""substance"" within the meaning of s 4 of the Act.

...

The answer to that question would involve consideration, inter alia, of whether the cardboard in fact ""contain[ed]"" any lysergide (see s 4 of the Act) ...

It would also involve consideration of the respondent's argument that the Crown had not proved that the cardboard was any more than a container or other vehicle to facilitate use of the drug and that it was not therefore itself a ""substance"" within the meaning of s 4. In support of this submission, he contended there was no evidence before the trial judge that the cardboard squares were designed to be swallowed, the only relevant evidence on this topic (""Usually the tab is placed inside the mouth, either on or under the tongue"") suggesting that they were not. The effect of the argument was that if the cardboard was simply intended to be put in the user's mouth until the lysergide was withdrawn and then to be discarded, the cardboard served no different function than a container or syringe from which the user extracted a drug.


	
	Because in that case the Crown did not identify a pure question of law, Macfarlan JA expressed no final view on whether cardboard impregnated with LSD was a “substance” within the meaning of s 4 of the DMT Act.
	
	
	At the hearing of this appeal, on the assumption that DS Wheatley’s evidence as to the method of consumption of cardboard LSD was inadmissible, the Crown submitted that the cardboard impregnated with LSD is nevertheless a preparation within the meaning of s 3.
	
	
	Like Macfarlan JA in R v SH, I would prefer to express a view about this issue in a case where it is squarely raised. In my view the present is not such a case.
	
	
	On the evidence here, the cardboard was designed to be swallowed and, accordingly, the cardboard impregnated with LSD was ingested by a user. The cardboard was not analogous to a container or syringe from which the user extracted a drug. A much closer analogy would be the non drug content of a film coating or a gelatin capsule used in the production of lawful drugs in the way described by the Full Federal Court in Sigma Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Ltd v Wyeth [2011] FCAFC 132. That film coating or gelatin capsule is an integral part of the ingestion by the user of the drug. In the same way here, the cardboard impregnated with LSD was an integral part of the ingestion by the user of the drug and thus a “preparation” or a “substance” within the meaning of s 4.
	
	
	As noted at the outset, counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial made no complaint about the admission of the evidence or the trial judge’s direction to the jury on this subject.
	
	
	In these circumstances, and having regard to the failure of counsel to seek any ruling or re-direction about this issue, leave to appeal should be refused in relation to Ground 3 under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Ground 4: The primary judge erred by not directing the jury to first determine what drugs were in the appellant’s possession

Ground 5: The primary judge erred by directing the jury to include the drugs found in the backpack and the ice cream container together


	
	Grounds 4 and 5 are grouped together as they raise the same or very similar issues.
	
	
	Under Ground 4, the appellant submits that the primary judge should have directed the jury to determine the question of possession by reference to each individual packet or location separately.
	
	
	Under Ground 5, the appellant submits that the primary judge erred in failing to direct the jury to determine separately whether the appellant was in possession of:
	



	
	the drugs in the backpack; and
	
	
	the drugs in the ice cream container.
	



	
	The appellant relies upon Alliston in support of these grounds.
	
	
	The trial judge directed the jury that:
	


... the Crown does not have to prove the accused knew about both the cardboard square and the vials. It is enough for this count, members of the jury, if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he possessed the cardboard or the vials or both.


	
	In relation to possession, the primary judge said, in summary, that the concept of possession has three elements:
	



	
	The first is that the appellant “knew the cardboard or the vials were in his house”;
	
	
	The second is that he “knew that they contained a prohibited drug”, but that he did not have to know which drug precisely; and
	
	
	The third is that he “was able to exercise control over the cardboard or the vials”.
	



	
	In relation to the third element his Honour directed the jury that:
	


... a person can have control over something, even if they do not own it or they are just minding it for a friend ... the accused can still have control over those bits of cardboard and those vials even if he did not own them, even if they did belong to CJ.


	
	In relation to possession of the cardboard tabs impregnated with LSD the primary judge said:
	


Now, in this case the accused says he knew about the cardboard squares in the bag and he touched them, picked it up. So he is certainly able to exercise control over it, but he says he thought they were foreign currency. Now, if that is reasonably possible, then the Crown has not proved that the accused was in possession of the cardboard squares. To be more precise, the Crown has not proved that he was in possession of the lysergide in the cardboard because the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that the cardboard contained a prohibited drug.


	
	In relation to possession of the liquid containing LSD the primary judge said:
	


... the accused said he saw one or two of them [the ampoules] but he said he did not know they contained a drug ... if that is reasonably possible, then the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt the accused was in possession of the lysergide in the vials because the Crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt the accused knew that the vials contained a prohibited drug.


	
	The primary judge reminded the jury that the appellant denied that he was in possession of the liquid or cardboard LSD.
	
	
	Under each of Grounds 4 and 5, the appellant submits that this constituted a misdirection because, so the argument proceeds, if he was not found to have been in possession of the ice cream container (on the basis of the Carey defence) he would not have possessed a traffickable quantity of LSD and could therefore not be deemed to have supplied LSD pursuant to s 29 of the DMT Act.
	
	
	The factual premise upon which this submission is based is incorrect. The quantity of LSD in the backpack (7.9 g), on its own, was well above the “large commercial quantity” threshold of 2 g.
	
	
	Under Ground 5, each of the two containers (the backpack and ice cream container) contained sufficient LSD to constitute a large commercial quantity. The appellant points to Alliston, but that was a case in which neither package alone was sufficient to constitute a large commercial quantity. Therefore that authority has limited application in the present circumstances.
	
	
	In the present case, no application was made by counsel for the appellant for a re-direction or further direction on the issue whether framed as it is now under Ground 4 or Ground 5. Counsel cannot be criticised for this as the appellant’s submissions on this point are based on an incorrect factual premise.
	
	
	For these reasons, leave to appeal in relation to Grounds 4 and 5 should be refused under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	


Ground 7: The primary judge erred by removing the alternative charge of “commercial quantity”

Ground 8: The primary judge erred by not having the alternate charge of “supply simpliciter”


	
	I have grouped Grounds 7 and 8 together as they seem to me to raise very similar issues.
	
	
	At trial, the primary judge and counsel had a number of discussions about whether the jury should be directed to consider alternative charges to supply of a large commercial quantity of LSD. The primary judge delivered an ex tempore judgment on the fifth day of the trial in which his Honour usefully summarised those discussions:
	


The accused faces a number of charges, but I need only focus on count 1 at the present point in time. That is an allegation that he supplied a large commercial quantity of lysergide which has been more often described as LSD during this trial. The Crown mentioned to the jury, in his opening, that there “might”, and I emphasise the word “might”, be alternatives that they need to consider. He did not tell the jury what they were. He did not tell the jury in what circumstances those would come up. The matter was left there.

...

Yesterday I raised with the lawyers at the conclusion of the evidence whether, on the evidence, the jury could find the accused not guilty on the large commercial supply matter but guilty of a lesser offence, such as commercial supply or supply simpliciter. I suggested that as the evidence had unfolded, I could not see a version of the facts which the jury might find, which would lead to that outcome.

...

However, yesterday I was persuaded by the lawyers that I should leave the alternatives to the jury. I then went and redrafted the question trail [to be left with the jury]. It was emailed to the lawyers overnight and we had some further discussions about it this morning. Given that history I was somewhat surprised that neither Mr Crown nor Mr Pickin, mentioned the possibility of alternatives to count 1 in their addresses to the jury. One might have thought that having told me that such verdicts were open, they might have given some guidance to the jury as to the circumstances in which those verdicts would be returned.

I raised this issue at the conclusion of the addresses at the departure of the jury. Both the Crown and Mr Pickin continued to ask me to leave at least one alternative, that of supply simpliciter. Mr Crown explains that his position is based on this possibility, that the jury might find that it was a reasonable possibility that the accused was unaware that he had more than two grams of the substance containing LSD in his possession. If so, the Crown legally and accurately points out that that could mean that the jury could nevertheless convict him of supply simpliciter.

The Crown says it is more appropriate that in that circumstance, than [sic] the accused be convicted of supply rather than entirely acquitted. I can understand the Crown’s position, even if I do not really accept that it is open on the facts.

Mr Pickin also says that I should leave supply simpliciter as an alternative. This I find more difficult to understand. I would have thought that it was in his client’s interest to not have the alternative left. If the jury found the accused not guilty of supplying a large commercial quantity then his client would then face no alternative charge on count 1. To put matters bluntly, the presence of an alternative [to] count 1 makes it more likely that Mr Finch will be convicted of something rather than nothing. But Mr Pickin does ask me to leave the alternative.

I am not going to do what the Crown and Mr Pickin asked me for these reasons. It is not for a judge for the first time, to tell a jury that there are alternatives to a count when the jury has been entirely unassisted by any submissions in final address by the Crown or counsel for the accused, as to the circumstances in which alternatives could arise.

Another reason I am not going to do it is, as I keep saying, I do not consider that it is really open on the evidence for the jury to reason as the Crown say they might, that is “the accused was in possession of the LSD”: He knew he was in possession of the LSD; but he did not realise that he had more than two grams of that substance.

I think that if I were to leave the alternative to the jury, it would not be in Mr Finch’s interests. ...


	
	Dealing first with Ground 7, the appellant submits that the primary judge erred in not leaving the “commercial quantity” alternative. He makes this submission:
	


If the Learned Trial Judge had directed the jury about the drugs, LSD cardboard and LSD liquid in particular, being in two separate places and to whether they thought that the accused had knowledge of both places the commercial quantity [charge] could well have been used.


	
	The appellant’s submission is based on the false factual premise identified in relation to Grounds 5 and 6 above. The evidence as to the weight of each discrete package of drugs had been admitted (and was contained in a table which was tendered by consent and became Exhibit 27). According to that evidence there was no individual package of LSD which weighed less than 0.5 g. Therefore there was no evidentiary basis for the jury to find that the appellant possessed a commercial quantity rather than a large commercial quantity of LSD.
	
	
	Dealing then with Ground 8, so far as the alternative charge of “supply simpliciter” is concerned, the appellant’s complaint in respect of this ground is that both parties asked the primary judge to leave the alternative charge of supply simpliciter.
	
	
	The High Court has set out the test for whether an alternative verdict should be left for the jury in James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; 253 CLR 475 as follows:
	



	
	the duty to leave an alternative verdict will depend on the real issues in the case and the forensic choices of counsel;
	
	
	the forensic choices of counsel are not determinative and on occasion the judge’s duty to secure a fair trial will require that an alternative verdict be left despite defence counsel’s objection;
	
	
	alternatively, the judge may refrain from leaving an alternative verdict if to do so would jeopardise the appellant’s chances of acquittal.
	



	
	In relation to both grounds, the primary judge was correctly of the view that leaving an alternative charge would not reflect the real issues in the case or the way the case was conducted. As he said:
	


... neither Mr Crown nor Mr Pickin, mentioned the possibility of alternatives to count 1 [i.e. deemed supply of a large commercial quantity] in their addresses to the jury. One might have thought that having told me that such verdicts were open, they might have given some guidance to the jury as to the circumstances in which those verdicts would be returned.


	
	Further, the primary judge’s clearly expressed and correct conclusion was that leaving either alternative charge to the jury would jeopardise the appellant’s chances of acquittal.
	
	
	The real issue in the case was the appellant’s Carey defence. That case depended on the jury accepting that the appellant had demonstrated that his possession of the drugs was merely momentary or transient and that he intended to return the drugs to CJ.
	
	
	The obvious forensic risk for the appellant in leaving either alternative charge is that it would distract the jury from what the appellant’s counsel was submitting was a simple decision they needed to make that would result in the appellant’s complete acquittal.
	
	
	As the primary judge said:
	


To put matters bluntly, the presence of an alternative [to] count 1 makes it more likely that Mr Finch will be convicted of something rather than nothing.


	
	Accordingly, the primary judge was correct not to leave either alternative charge to the jury.
	
	
	Grounds 7 and 8 should be dismissed.
	


Ground 9: The appellant was unable to receive a fair trial without the police informant being there to give evidence


	
	The appellant submits that the Crown had a duty to call CJ as a witness and that he was unable to receive a fair trial without CJ giving evidence.
	
	
	In Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; 210 CLR 285, Gaudron and Hayne JJ said at [11]:
	


... a basic requirement of the adversary system of criminal justice is that the prosecution, representing the State, must act ""with fairness and detachment and always with the objectives of establishing the whole truth in accordance with the procedures and standards which the law requires to be observed and of helping to ensure that the accused's trial is a fair one"" (emphasis added).  That requires the prosecution to call all available material witnesses unless there is some good reason not to do so.  The fact that a witness will give an account inconsistent with the prosecution case is not a sufficient reason for not calling that person [footnotes omitted].


	
	In Pratten v R [2014] NSWCCA 117 this Court set out the relevant principles (at [144]-[145]):
	


It is for the Crown prosecutor to determine the witnesses that the Crown will call in proof of guilt, subject at all times to the overriding principle that the Crown case must be presented according to the procedures and standards of a fair trial so as to accord fairness to the accused: see Whitehorn v The Queen [1983] HCA 42; 152 CLR 657 at 664 where Deane J observed:

""Whether or not their names appear on the back of the indictment or information, all witnesses whose testimony is necessary for the presentation of the whole picture, to the extent that it can be presented by admissible and available evidence, should be called by the Crown unless valid reason exists for refraining from calling a particular witness or witnesses, such as that the interests of justice would be prejudiced rather than served by the calling of an unduly large number of witnesses to establish a particular point.""

The Crown's failure to call a witness who was able to give relevant and admissible evidence concerning the central facts and events upon which the prosecution is based may be productive of such unfairness that, when viewed objectively in the context of the trial as a whole, results in a substantial miscarriage of justice: R v Apostilides [1984] HCA 38; 154 CLR 563 at 575, 577-578 (per curiam). Consideration of the questions whether a witness should have been called and whether the failure to call that witness has occasioned a miscarriage of justice can be determined only by reference to what is shown to be the significance of the witness' evidence to the issues at trial, the witness' credibility and reliability and any explanation of the Crown for not calling the witness: Whitehorn at 666.


	
	The appellant submits that CJ’s absence from the trial “deprived me ... of a fair trial and resulted in a miscarriage of justice”. That is because the evidence that CJ would have been able to provide went directly to a central issue at trial, being the availability of the Carey defence.
	
	
	The appellant further submits that CJ was not “unavailable” for the purposes of the Evidence Act because not all reasonable steps had been taken to locate him. The issue of whether a witness is unavailable is relevant for the purposes of hearsay evidence only. Those principles are not engaged presently.
	
	
	This is a case where the Crown attempted to call CJ as a witness and provided an explanation for its failure to do so. In considering whether the appellant was able to receive a fair trial without CJ giving evidence a number of matters are relevant.
	
	
	First, it was uncontroversial that CJ had alerted the police to the existence of drugs at the appellant’s house. For his cooperation, CJ received a discounted sentence with respect to various other drug charges. This clearly made him a relevant witness and the Crown understood that he should be called to give evidence. A subpoena was obtained to secure his attendance.
	
	
	Second, the police had made attempts to serve CJ with the subpoena to attend the trial to give evidence. SC Smith gave evidence that he made a number of attempts to contact CJ on his mobile phone and four attempts to serve CJ at his residence. He was unable to serve CJ because the premises had a locked security gate. He said he could have gone over the gate “but the property is a rural property”, so he did not. The locked gate and the failure to answer a mobile telephone do not provide an entirely satisfactory explanation for the failure to serve the subpoena upon CJ, however no complaint was made at the trial about the failure to serve the subpoena.
	
	
	Third, as a result of CJ’s cooperation with the police, the Commissioner of Police sought, and obtained, various suppression and non-publication orders with respect to the identity and identifying details of CJ at the trial. In seeking those orders a delegate of the Commissioner of Police provided an “open affidavit” which stated the following:
	


It is understood that the accused intends to conduct a defence in reliance upon the decision in R v Carey (1990) 50 A Crim R 163, by asserting that the witness, in order to obtain a benefit for himself, placed drugs in the accused’s residence and then informed police of the existence and location of the drugs.

Having been alerted to the accused’s proposed defence, the Director of Public Prosecutions requested and obtained a statement from the witness to the effect that the witness did not place any drugs in the premises of the accused.

A copy of the statement of the witness and other documents have been served on the accused’s solicitor ….


	
	Fourth, it is clear that in the statements provided to the police CJ denied leaving any drugs at the appellant’s home. The appellant, in his written submissions, states that CJ’s statements were “submitted to the court” on day two of the trial. However, the transcript of the trial and the summing up makes clear that no such statement was tendered.
	
	
	No statement by CJ was provided to this Court prior to the hearing of this appeal. The Crown acknowledged that the Court ought to be able to review for itself CJ’s statement in order to determine whether the appellant was able to receive a fair trial without CJ giving evidence. Both statements made by CJ were provided to this Court following the hearing of this appeal. Each contain no exculpatory material or any other material that would lead to the conclusion that the appellant was not able to receive a fair trial without CJ giving evidence.
	
	
	Fifth, CJ was one of three people present at the appellant’s home on the night of 31 August 2010. The other two were the appellant and Mr Oakley. The appellant and Mr Oakley gave evidence that CJ brought various items to the appellant’s home and arranged, with the appellant, that he would retrieve those items at a later point in time, by meeting the appellant at the Ayres Rock Roadhouse and by returning at some later time to collect the items in the ice cream container. It is undoubtedly correct that the jury was deprived of the benefit of observing CJ being cross-examined on his version of events and contrasting that evidence with that provided by the appellant and Mr Oakley.
	
	
	Sixth, it was objectively open to defence counsel to approach CJ’s absence on the basis that it afforded the appellant a forensic advantage in establishing the Carey defence. The appellant bore the onus of proving the facts underlying the Carey defence on the balance of probabilities. In his final address to the jury, defence counsel said:
	


It is clear and we have adduced evidence from two of them [the appellant and Mr Oakley], you’ve had the opportunity to scrutinise them and you would accept on balance their evidence. There would be no reason, no good reason to reject their evidence and ultimately when you consider that the individual CJ has not been called by a Crown witness [sic] you would be left comfortably with the proposition that the defence have made out the case in relation to the possession with intent to return to the owner, as opposed to sale.


	
	This passage clearly indicates that the appellant’s counsel considered that, as a consequence of CJ’s absence, the appellant was in a stronger position to establish the Carey defence, which was the central question in the case, and would have remained the central issue even if CJ had given evidence. It was objectively open to him to form that view.
	
	
	Seventh, defence counsel made no application for the trial to be stayed or adjourned due to the unavailability of CJ. This supports the conclusion that CJ’s absence afforded the appellant a forensic advantage in establishing the Carey defence.
	
	
	Returning to the tests established in cases such as Apostilides and Whitehorn (referred to in the extract from Pratten above), the significance of the failure of the Crown to call CJ to give evidence is to be determined by reference to what is shown to be the significance of his evidence to the issues at trial, his credibility and reliability and any explanation of the Crown for not calling the witness.
	
	
	There is little evidence about CJ’s reliability and credibility. The primary judge directed the jury that:
	


The law is that where someone assists the authorities by giving them information about things they say they know, that you can get a reduction on your sentence for doing that. ...

So that's the law. Of course what you've got to consider is whether that provides an incentive for sometimes people to come along and say things that aren't true. Quite clearly there's an incentive for people that are charged with crimes to make up false information about other people so that they can get a discount. That's one of the matters that you would no doubt be thinking about as you consider this case. Was there an incentive for CJ to do something which may have falsely led to Mr Finch being prosecuted, just so CJ could get a reduction on his sentence?


	
	While the sufficiency of the explanation of the police for the failure to serve a subpoena on CJ may be doubted, this was not the subject of complaint at the trial.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, defence counsel made a forensic decision to embrace the absence of CJ. He plainly took the view that CJ’s absence gave him a forensic advantage in establishing the Carey defence. That conclusion was objectively open to him.
	
	
	Concerning the significance of his evidence to the issues at trial, it is clear from CJ’s statements that he would say that the appellant was a significant drug dealer and that he, CJ, was a customer not a supplier of the appellant. Unless CJ’s evidence was totally discredited and, in effect, the jury concluded that the opposite of what he had to say was true, the appellant had a powerful reason, if he could, to conduct the case without CJ giving evidence.
	
	
	It may be, of course, that CJ would have been destroyed in cross-examination and admitted that the drugs belonged to him.
	
	
	In this case, of itself, even that admission would not necessarily have led to an acquittal. To achieve an acquittal the appellant would also have had to hope that the jury would fail to be satisfied the appellant knew that he had prohibited drugs at his premises (in the case of the LSD) or establish that his possession of the LSD and methylamphetamine was transitory.
	
	
	CJ’s evidence was unlikely to assist him in achieving either aim. From defence counsel’s point of view at the trial, whilst it was conceivable that all of these favourable matters may have been able to be established in cross-examination of CJ, it was equally possible that the cross-examination of CJ would prove to be a forensic disaster for the appellant.
	
	
	If CJ told the jury the things contained in his two police statements (or gave even a part of that evidence), it could amount to very significant evidence tending to show the appellant was guilty of counts one and two on the indictment.
	
	
	It was objectively open to defence counsel, in the situation he found himself, to conclude that the far less dangerous course was to proceed in the trial without taking steps (by seeking an adjournment or making a stay application) to secure the attendance of CJ to give evidence.
	
	
	Given the quantity of drugs found at the appellant’s house and the central role of the Carey defence in attempting to secure an acquittal for his client, defence counsel plainly decided that the preferable course was to call the appellant and Mr Oakley and submit to the jury (as he did) that the only direct evidence before them of the events on the evening of 31 August was that given by the defence. That course was objectively open to him.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the submission that the appellant was unable to receive a fair trial without CJ giving evidence should be rejected, and Ground 9 should be dismissed.
	


Ground 6: The verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence

Ground 10: The issues mentioned above “tainted” the appellant’s trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice


	
	These grounds are addressed together and last because it is clear that this Court must review all of the evidence before the trial court in order to form a proper conclusion.
	
	
	The applicable principles are set out in SKA v The Queen:
	



	
	In applications of this nature the Court is asked whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ);
	
	
	The test stated in M v The Queen is not materially different (although different in form) to the statutory test contained in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That test is whether the verdict is “unreasonable” or “cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”: MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [58].
	


(The appellant relies upon s 6(1) with respect to ground 10. Therefore, Grounds 6 and 10 are relevantly identical.)


	
	The Court is to make an “an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"": Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473. Furthermore:
	


In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict.  Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1).  The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand' [footnotes omitted].


	
	M v The Queen at 492-493 (per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ).
	
	
	The jury has an advantage over a court of criminal appeal in having heard and seen the witnesses at trial. If that advantage is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by an appeal court, the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. But if the doubt cannot be explained that way, a miscarriage has occurred: M v The Queen at 493.
	



	
	In determining if there has been a miscarriage of justice, a decision by counsel for the defence to take or refrain from taking a particular course at the trial needs to be examined to determine if it has or could have resulted in a forensic advantage. That is an objective test. The forensic advantage must be weighed in comparison to any defect or irregularity found in the trial: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [8]-[16]; [26]-[28]; [32]-[33] and [107]-[109].
	
	
	Having reviewed the whole of the evidence, which is described in detail above, I have come to the conclusion that the verdict was not unreasonable and can be supported having regard to the evidence. Further, the issues about which the appellant makes complaint did not “taint” the appellant’s trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	On the whole of the evidence, the jury was entitled to reach the view that it did on both counts one and two in the indictment (count three is not presently relevant as the appellant was acquitted).
	
	
	In addressing the question of whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence, the first significant matter was the quantity of prohibited drugs found in various places, hidden all over the appellant’s house.
	
	
	The appellant admitted that he possessed the methylamphetamine the subject of count two, the only issue being the Carey defence.
	
	
	So far as the LSD the subject of count one was concerned, there was a large commercial quantity found in the appellant’s own backpack, interspersed with his own medication.
	
	
	The jury was entitled to conclude that he was knowingly in possession of the LSD contained in that backpack. This was on the basis of all of the evidence, including his own evidence that;
	



	
	he was ""half-half"" aware of the contents of the backpack;
	
	
	""maybe"" the envelope in the backpack contained LSD; and
	
	
	he himself put the plastic bag containing the LSD into that backpack.
	



	
	So far as the other large commercial quantity of LSD was concerned (found in the ice cream container hidden in the laundry), the appellant’s fingerprint was found on the plastic bag which contained it and the container also had in it a card belonging to a business associate of the appellant. This was another significant matter, from which the jury was entitled to conclude that he was knowingly in possession of LSD.
	
	
	The second significant matter was the conduct of the appellant at the time the police arrived to search the premises and in the conduct of that search.
	
	
	When the police arrived the appellant was attempting to hide a container of methylamphetamine behind a bookcase, as “it was a bad look”.
	
	
	Further, a quantity of methylamphetamine was found in the appellant’s bedroom and a tab of LSD was found in the drawer of the desk in the study where the appellant worked. During the search, the ice cream container was found hidden in the laundry. It contained a large commercial quantity of LSD and a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The scales and drug paraphernalia found hidden in the appellant’s ceiling were also significant matters. The notes found in the appellant’s handwriting were clearly capable of referring to drug sales and the jury was entitled also to take those notes into account in finding the appellant guilty. Those matters, and the presence of a surveillance camera at the appellant’s premises, were all matters the jury was entitled to take into account in finding the appellant guilty of counts one and two.
	
	
	When the jury came to consider the Carey defence, the appellant’s explanation for how it was that the ice cream container came to be hidden in his laundry was frankly incredible. Accepting, for present purposes, the appellant’s evidence that he agreed with CJ to take the backpack to the Ayres Rock roadhouse at 2.30 pm the next day, no explanation was given as to why LSD and methylamphetamine in even greater quantities came to be hidden in the laundry. The appellant’s evidence was that no agreement had been made to collect those drugs the next day, despite the fact that he was aware that the container had within it, at least, pills that he thought contained ecstasy, small resealable bags known as “deal bags”, and a straw. The appellant gave evidence that CJ said of this container, “I can’t take this with me. I can’t go home. They’re looking for me”. The jury was entitled to regard as significant the fact that, despite knowing all of these matters, and the fact that CJ had hidden the container somewhere on his property, the appellant could provide no reasonable or sensible explanation for the ice cream container found in his laundry, including, of course, the appellant’s fingerprint found on the plastic bag which contained a large commercial quantity of LSD.
	
	
	The third significant matter was the inherent improbability of key features of the appellant’s version of events upon which the Carey defence rested. The appellant’s case was that when CJ was arrested and the police found only a relatively minor amount of cannabis, so anxious was CJ to get a discounted sentence that he took prohibited drugs (the cardboard tabs of LSD alone having a street value over $73,000) to the appellant’s house.
	
	
	The appellant permitted CJ, in the middle of the night, to hide those drugs at various separate locations throughout his house. He did so having placed his fingerprint on a plastic bag containing a large commercial quantity of LSD. The appellant gave evidence that he permitted CJ, who he described as “fairly worked up” and “unstable”, to roam unattended in his house with a large quantity of what he knew was prohibited drugs between 1 am and 3 am.
	
	
	The appellant’s principal explanation for doing so was that he needed to print documents in another room with Mr Oakley as those documents were important to completing his taxation return.
	
	
	Further, the appellant gave evidence that he made an agreement with CJ to return the backpack containing a large quantity of prohibited drugs to him at 2.30 pm the following day. Yet, when CJ did not contact him that day, the appellant did nothing to contact CJ or dispose of those drugs. The jury were entitled to reject the evidence led in relation to the Carey defence.
	
	
	The fourth significant matter was the absence of CJ as a witness. As set out in addressing Ground 9 above, given the central plank of the appellant’s case was a Carey defence, the critical question is whether the decision of defence counsel to refrain from insisting that the trial be adjourned until CJ’s attendance to give evidence could be secured, could have resulted in a forensic advantage which must be weighed in comparison to any defect or irregularity found in the trial.
	
	
	In this case, objectively determined, defence counsel could take the view that the appellant was in a stronger position to establish the Carey defence, which was the central question in the case, if CJ was not called to give evidence. Even assuming that the sufficiency of the explanation of the police for failing to serve the subpoena on CJ to secure his attendance at the trial were rejected, and that this gave rise to an irregularity in the trial, when weighed against the forensic advantage to the appellant of CJ’s absence, there was no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The fifth significant matter was the evidence concerning the LSD, both in liquid and cardboard form. As set out in addressing Grounds 2 and 3 above, there were legitimate forensic choices to be made about these issues and the forensic choices made by defence counsel were objectively open to him. The verdicts were not unreasonable or against the weight of the evidence.
	
	
	The appellant’s best chance of securing an acquittal was the jury accepting his Carey defence. Even if successful objection was taken to the admission of the evidence of the weight of the cardboard being taken into account in addressing the “large commercial quantity” threshold, the appellant could still have been convicted of possession of a large commercial quantity of LSD represented by the LSD in liquid form.
	
	
	On this topic, the other principal point that the appellant made in oral submissions to this Court should be rejected. At the end of the third day of the trial, after the conclusion of the accused’s examination in chief, the primary judge said to defence counsel in the absence of the jury:
	


“... all I want you to think about is whether consistent with who bears the onus of proving what you’re happy that there has been no evidence at all about the vials of LSD and think about that overnight ...” [emphasis added].

The appellant submitted that this was evidence favourable to him, and that the primary judge was indicating that there was “no evidence” from the police about the quantity of the LSD in the vials.


	
	However, what the primary judge was saying in this passage was that the appellant’s examination in chief had finished and the appellant had not given any evidence about the vials which evidence was critical to his Carey defence.
	
	
	The primary judge was, properly and fairly, alerting defence counsel to the fact that he had missed the opportunity to elicit a statement from the defendant about the vials. This was made clear when defence counsel returned to this issue and led a statement from the appellant designed to address the matter the primary judge had raised.
	
	
	The sixth significant matter is the careful and fair summing up of the primary judge. Other than the specific complaints which have been addressed above in relation to the other grounds of appeal, no further complaint was made about that summing up. Considering those complaints about the summing up together, as well as separately, there was no miscarriage of justice in the present case.
	
	
	For these reasons, the verdict was not unreasonable and was supported by the evidence. Further, none of the issues about which the appellant makes complaint “tainted” the appellant’s trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Grounds 6 and 10 of the Notice of Appeal should be dismissed.
	


Proposed Ground 11: Incompetence of defence counsel


	
	At the hearing of this appeal the appellant sought leave to add a further ground of appeal. The Court ruled that it would entertain further submissions about this application after delivery of its principal reasons.
	
	
	By Proposed Ground 11 the appellant seeks to contend that his trial counsel was incompetent in two respects:
	



	
	he was often late;
	
	
	he “didn’t seem to be aware about the laws concerning LSD”, which I understood to mean he did not object to the evidence of DS Wheatley concerning the method of consumption of cardboard LSD or make the submission concerning liquid LSD referred to in addressing Ground 3 above.
	



	
	The seminal case with respect to incompetence of counsel is R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 in which Gleeson CJ said at 685:
	


As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.


	
	In Alkhair v R [2016] NSWCCA 4 Macfarlan JA (Rothman J and Bellew J agreeing) comprehensively summarised the applicable principles with respect to incompetence of counsel. His Honour conducted an extensive review of the cases decided by this Court since Birks, and concluded (at [31]):
	


1. To the extent possible, an appellate court should determine an appeal involving complaints about a trial counsel’s conduct of a case by examining the record of the trial to determine from the objective circumstances whether the accused has had a fair trial.

2. Ordinarily, an affirmative answer to this question is required where the impugned conduct is capable of being rationally explained as a step taken, or not taken, in the interests of the accused. This is so even if the accused alleges on appeal that he or she did not authorise the conduct because the nature of the adversarial system means that the client is bound by the manner in which the trial is conducted on his or her behalf.

3. Only in exceptional circumstances will an appellate court find it necessary to resort to subjective evidence concerning the appellant’s legal representatives’ reasoning at trial or to evidence as to communications between the appellant and those representatives.

4. The ultimate question for an appellate court is whether the appellant has established that what occurred at the trial gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open.


	
	Rational forensic decisions or strategies of trial counsel, determined objectively, do not give rise to a miscarriage of justice: Ahmu v R; Director of Public Prosecutions v Ahmu [2014] NSWCCA 312 at [34] (per Basten JA) and [56] (per Adams J).
	
	
	Having regard to the ruling made at the hearing, each party should be given leave to file and serve, within 14 days, written submissions addressing the issue of whether leave to add an additional Ground 11 should be granted, and whether, if leave is granted, there is any need for a further oral hearing.
	


Conclusion and orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted on Grounds 1-10 under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW);
	
	
	Leave to appeal refused on Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules;
	
	
	Grounds 6-10 of the Notice of Appeal dismissed;
	
	
	Within 14 days the parties exchange with one another and file written submissions of no greater length than 10 pages each with the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the subject of whether:
	



	
	having regard to these reasons, leave should be granted to amend the notice of appeal to include Proposed Ground 11; and
	
	
	if leave under paragraph 4(a) of these orders were granted, what orders the Court should make and whether it would be necessary or desirable to receive any further evidence or to conduct any further oral hearing of the matter.
	



	
	McCALLUM J: I have read in draft the judgments of Payne JA and Davies J.  I agree with the orders proposed by Payne JA, for the reasons his Honour has stated.  Initially, I also had the concern expressed by Davies J as to the absence of CJ at the trial.  However, my assessment of the evidence has brought me to the conclusion reached by Payne JA and Davies J that the decision not to pursue CJ’s attendance at trial was a forensic decision and probably a sound one.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I have read in draft the judgment of Payne JA. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and the orders which he proposes. Because Grounds 6 and 10 raise the matter of an unreasonable verdict and a miscarriage of justice it is necessary for me to add some brief remarks of my own.
	
	
	I am satisfied from my own assessment of the evidence that the Crown case was a strong one subject to the appellant establishing his Carey defence. The locations of the drugs at the appellant’s house made that task a difficult one. Although I was initially concerned about the failure of CJ to give evidence at the trial because his absence might have been a disadvantage to the appellant, I am now persuaded that the evidence that CJ would have given ([65] above) together with what must be regarded as a forensic decision by the Appellant’s counsel not to seek an adjournment until CJ was brought to Court make it likely that CJ’s evidence would have been a significant disadvantage to the appellant. That is the more so when the jury clearly did not accept the evidence of Mr Oakley who corroborated the appellant’s evidence and was subject to very little challenge in cross-examination.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Payne JA there was no miscarriage of justice nor was there the absence of a fair trial by reason of CJ not being called to give evidence. In those circumstances it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.

2701330,R v Khoshaba [2016] NSWDC 150,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: When the offender in this case, Johni Khoshaba, gave evidence and said he was sorry for supplying drugs, the offence for which I must sentence him, he was asked by the Crown why it was wrong for him to have done what he did. All Mr Khoshaba could say at that stage was that it was wrong to supply drugs because that was against the law. Later through a leading question in re-examination, he did mention the harm that drug supplying causes. It seems that the offender has a limited concept of just how harmful drug supply and drug use are. In truth, such activities cause significant harm to drug users, the families of drug users, and the community generally. That is why those convicted of supplying drugs face a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and it is why the Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly said that those who are trafficking to a substantial degree must expect a full‑time sentence of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances. Make no mistake, this was serious offending.
	
	
	In the very early hours of Saturday 1 August 2015 police were in Surry Hills, they saw a Volkswagen hatch car and stopped that vehicle. They approached the driver’s side. As the window was wound down a strong scent of cannabis wafted out, and not surprisingly, given that circumstance, police decided that they would search the vehicle. Eventually they found a very small quantity of cannabis, and much more importantly, a total of 47 capsules of MDMA. The offender was one of the three occupants of the car and he told police that the drugs were his, that he intended to use some of them but to supply the rest to friends of his whom he was going to meet up with that evening in order to celebrate his 19th birthday, having turned 19 just a day or so earlier.
	
	
	The offender gave sworn evidence-in-chief, and he was cross-examined by the Crown. There is no evidence to contradict the offender’s assertion that that was the limit of his drug supply activities, on a single occasion purchasing $500 worth of ecstasy tablets for the purposes of distributing them to his friends at his birthday party to take place that evening, I will thus sentence him on the basis that that is what he was going to do. There is no commercial flavour to this offence, he was not intending to sell the drugs, nor was he intending to supply to anyone other than his friends. That is of course a significant matter in assessing the objective gravity of his conduct.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so he is entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed upon him. I will not quantify that discount, it has been one of a number of factors which has led to me imposing a different form of sentence on the offender from that I would have otherwise have imposed. He has also asked that I take that into account when I sentence him for the drug supply matter, an offence of possessing cannabis. The photographs of the relevant drug were tendered by the Crown, it is a very small quantity indeed, and properly described as remnants.
	
	
	The offender was born in Iraq, he came to Australia with his parents and his sister when he was about five years of age. His parents separated when he was about 12 and he sees his father but lives with his mother and sister. He has not told anyone in his family about his current charge. His girlfriend knows, and indeed, she is in court today to support him.
	
	
	This is one of a number of fairly common cases where the arrest and charging of the offender has led to a significant change in his lifestyle. Mr Khoshaba left school after completing Year 12 but did not get his HSC. He started out as an apprentice bricklayer but has since changed to a carpentry apprenticeship, which he is close to completing. Indeed the cannabis to which I referred appears to have been wrapped up in some teaching materials relating to roof construction. A reference from Mr Khoshaba’s employer was tendered on his behalf today. His employer speaks highly of him and also speaks of the consequences for the offender of having been charged. He speaks of stress and constant worry as a result of being charged and having to be sentenced for his wrong‑doing. Perhaps most importantly the offender, and there is nothing to contradict this, says that he has given up drug use.
	
	
	There is a MERIT report tendered on the offender’s behalf. The offender told those on the program that after his arrest he had continued to use drugs but then ceased all drug use. There is, it has to be said, nothing to back up these claims by way of urinalysis, but all the other evidence does suggest that what Mr Khoshaba has said about ceasing drug use is likely to be true. Mr Khoshaba no longer associates with the people who he intended to supply drugs to and so he is in a much different position than he was on the day of hs arrest.
	
	
	It is important to note that he just barely turned 19 at the time of the offence. Youth has always been regarded as a significant factor in determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon a person. More and more we are understanding about the way people mature, and thus an offence committed by a 19 year old often does not demonstrate the same moral culpability as an offence committed by someone significantly older.
	
	
	Part of the change in Mr Khoshaba has no doubt come about because of consequences for him since his arrest. He was in custody for a day and a half and then for a while on fairly strict bail conditions, reporting every day and subject to a curfew. How he could be in custody for a day and a half and then comply with a curfew and report to police every day without his mother finding out is a bit difficult to understand, but I accept that he has kept these things from her because of his concern for her.
	
	
	In evidence Mr Khoshaba said that he had learnt a lesson. I suspect that is true. He thus has good prospects of rehabilitation and, at least if he continues on the path that he appears to be on at the moment, he is unlikely to offend again in the future.
	
	
	The question now becomes what sentence to impose upon him? He was certainly not trafficking to a substantial degree and so he does not need to demonstrate exceptional circumstances before a sentence of other than full time custody will be imposed upon him.
	
	
	Mr Khatiz, who appeared for Mr Khoshaba, relied on two sources of information to assist me, one was some sentencing statistics and the other was a single case from the Court of Criminal Appeal of R v Mauger [2012] NSWCCA 51. In that case English DCJ had given an offender the benefit of an order under s 10(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in circumstances where there were some similarities between that offender’s conduct and Mr Khoshaba’s. In that case a 30 year old man pleaded guilty to supplying MDMA, that plea being based on his possession of 20 ecstasy tablets at a music festival. He intended to take two tablets and give the balance to friends over the course of the weekend. Her Honour took into account things which the Court of Criminal Appeal said should not have been taken into account, such as what was described as a generalised prognostication about how travel overseas would be affected by a conviction, but importantly - certainly importantly for this offender - the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the Crown appeal against what was asserted to be the leniency of the sentence imposed.
	
	
	Mr Khatiz freely admits that that is but a single case, and indeed acknowledges that the sentencing statistics to which he refers show that the vast majority of those who plead guilty to supplying a prohibited drug do not get the benefit of an order s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The Court of Criminal Appeal has said on many occasions that a single case does not establish a range, but on the other hand it is important to avoid what the High Court in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 described as a badge of unfairness, namely, inconsistency in sentencing. For that reason the decision in Mauger has been of significant assistance to me.
	
	
	In deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender I pay particular regard to the non‑commercial nature of this transaction, that it appears to have been a one-off exercise; that the offender was very young; that he has spent some time, a very short time, but nevertheless significant for him, in custody; that he has changed his lifestyle by giving up drugs and not associating with those with whom he use to associate; and I am satisfied that he has very good prospects of rehabilitation. In my view, this is one of these very rare cases where I am satisfied that a s 10 order can be made for a drug supply offence. The offender, should he comply with the conditions of the bond I am about to announce, will be able to put this isolated episode of wrong doing behind him. I frankly admit that this sentence achieves little, if anything, to deter others from similar offending, but despite that, I am satisfied that this is the most appropriate sentence in the present case.
	
	
	Taking into account the matter on the Form 1 I find the offence proved without proceeding to conviction. The offender is released on a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from today. The conditions of that bond are that,
	



	
	He is to commit no criminal offences whatsoever.
	
	
	He is to use no illegal drugs at all.
	
	
	He is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service for as long as they consider appropriate.
	
	
	In order to confirm that he is not using illegal drugs he is to undergo urinalysis on at least three occasions within the first six months of the bond, the results of which are to be provided to my associate. In the event that the Probation and Parole Service does not organise such urinalysis, the offender is to arrange for his own urinalysis.
	
	
	He is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.
	
	
	He is tell the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.

2701339,Regina v Serkan Toprak [2016] NSWDC 231,"sentence


	
	Serkan Toprak appears for sentence after he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, and one count of assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon, both offences contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each offence is 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In addition the offender asks me to take into account one further count of robbery armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 on a Form 1.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The parties presented an agreed statement of facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	At about 6am on Sunday 18 October 2015 the victim Sirugar Kula(?) was standing behind the counter area of the United Service Station at Rookwood Road at Yagoona. At this time the offender walked in through the front glass door.
	
	
	The offender approached the front counter and pulled out a 30 to 40 centimetre long knife from his jumper saying, “If you don’t give me the money I’ll harm you”. Fearing for his safety the victim opened the cash register. The offender said, “Give me all the money”. The victim started to remove the cash from the till. The offender said, “Show me the money”. The victim pulled out the cash draw handing it to the offender. The offender removed all the notes before leaving the service station. The amount of cash taken was approximately $500.
	
	
	Police were contacted and an investigation was commenced. The entire incident was captured on the service station’s closed circuit television.
	
	
	At about 10.55pm on Monday 19 October 2015 the victim Sirkandar Riaz was working at the 7-Eleven Service Station on the Hume Highway at Lansvale when the offender was seen at the front door. At the time the door was locked. Assuming the offender was a customer Riaz unlocked the door allowing the offender into the store.
	
	
	The offender approached Riaz who was behind the counter. The offender walked to the counter and said, “Winfield”. Riaz asked “What size and flavour?” The offender said, “Give me two packets of Winfield Blue 25”. Riaz turned his back on the offender to open the cabinet which contains the cigarettes.
	
	
	When Riaz turned to face the offender Riaz noticed the offender was holding a 30 to 40 centimetre long knife in his hand. The offender said, “Give me all the money”. Riaz opened the cash register and removed the cash drawer placing it on the counter. The offender asked for $50 and $100 notes. Riaz said, “I don’t have any $50 or $100 notes.” The offender removed all the cash that was in the cash drawer and took two packets of Winfield Blue cigarettes before leaving. The amount of cash taken was approximately $200. The cigarettes were valued at $29 per packet.
	
	
	Police were contacted and an investigation commenced. The offender was wearing the same clothes as in the previous offence.
	
	
	At about 11.45pm on Monday 19 October 2015 the victim Krishna Alamie was at the front counter of the Speedway Service Station at Cumberland Highway at Smithfield. At this time the offender entered the store, picked up some items for apparent purchase before approaching where Alamie was standing outside the door to the area behind the counter.
	
	
	The offender said to Alamie, “Give me the money, give me the money. Keep the door open and don’t lock it or I’ll kill you”. Alamie said, “What do you want?” The offender was holding a 30 centimetre long knife and put it against the outside of Alamie’s right thigh. The sharp tip of the knife was the only part of the knife that touched Alamie, causing a small cut on the outside of his thigh. As the offender pushed the tip of the knife into Alamie’s thigh he said, “How much do you have in the drawer? Give me everything”. Alamie said, “What?” The offender said, “Don’t lock the door. Don’t lock it or I’ll kill you”.
	
	
	Alamie walked through the doorway and to the cash register that was closed. Alamie opened the cash register and took out all the $100 notes, $50 notes and $20 notes that were in the till. Alamie handed the money to the offender who was still standing at the doorway entry to where the cash register was.
	
	
	Alamie handed the cash to the offender who put it in his right shorts pocket and ran out of the store. The amount of cash given to the offender was approximately $600. The police were contacted.
	
	
	On Wednesday 21 October 2015 information was received by police that the offender was responsible for the armed robbery of the 7-Eleven Hume Highway, Lansvale, at the Speedway Service Station, and that he was currently residing at 95 Belar Avenue, Villawood. Police subsequently applied for and were granted a search warrant.
	
	
	At 6pm the search was executed. The offender was interviewed by police. During the interview he was asked about his movements. The offender stated that he could not remember anything from those days and had taken an unknown amount of ice, or methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The offender was shown stills from each of the offences. He freely admitted that the person in the stills was him, and admitted that he must have committed the offences, although he had no memory of each incident. During the interview the offender cried and appeared to show genuine remorse for his actions stating that he wanted to make amends by paying back the proceeds of the robberies.
	


THE OFFENDER’S CASE ON SENTENCE


	
	The offender was called before me today and cross-examined. Prior to the commission of the offences he was employed as a demolition supervisor. A large number of his family are here today to support him. He participated truthfully in the interviews that gave rise to the pre-sentence report, and also the psychological report.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he had used a large quantity of ice immediately prior to the 42 hours of offending. He had never used ice in that quantity, only using small amounts before. Before the age of 25 he did not use drugs at all. He said that it was stress from work and also hanging out with the wrong crowd that led him into drugs in the first place.
	
	
	He left school in year 10 at age 16 or 17 because he was involved with the wrong crowd. He accepted that during the course of his life his choice of friends had been poor.
	
	
	He gave evidence that he had previously had a problem with gambling, particularly on poker machines at hotels. On occasions when he went to gamble he met people who were undesirable. He intends not to associate with those types of people in the future. He estimates that in recent times he has put approximately $100,000 through the poker machines, giving rise to the financial constraints that led him into abuse of illicit drugs.
	
	
	He has had no treatment for his gambling addiction but is willing to attend to treatment. He understands that he may be tempted to go back, and that treatment is an important way of preventing that from occurring.
	
	
	He gave evidence before me today, which I accept, that he does not remember the offences in question. He accepts that he needs to change his life and address his problems to ensure that he is unlikely to re-offend. He intends not to use ice again, he wants to get out of a gaol and start a family. He is prepared to participate in counselling and rehabilitation programmes in order to allow this to happen.
	
	
	He accepts that the victims of his offences would have been terrified, scared and upset. He accepts that they would still be scared going back to work even after these events had occurred for some particular time. He apologised in his evidence to the victims, and also to the community in relation to his actions.
	
	
	He accepts that in the future he will deal with work stress differently and not put himself under so much pressure.
	
	
	He has a fiancé and intends to get married when he is released from custody. He also intends to live with his father and care for him because his health is poor.
	
	
	In cross-examination he told me that he did not intend to tell the psychologist that this was his first time using ice, he had intended to convey that it was the first time he had used ice in sufficient quantity. It was apparent from his cross-examination that he usually worked hard, namely six days a week, comprising of hours of about 7am to 5pm.
	
	
	In the nine months he has been in custody he has been incarcerated in three different prisons. He has not, at this point, investigated any programmes for which he may be eligible. He gave evidence that he has learnt hard lessons in gaol but that it has had a positive effect on him. That drugs in the future are likely to remind him of gaol, that he does not want to be there because he does not want to associate with the type of people who he has met in prison. He believes that he has been taught a good lesson.
	
	
	In addition he relied on a psychological report of Esperanza Egan, dated 17 June 2016. Many of the matters about which he gave evidence are confirmed by Mr Egan and I will not repeat them.
	
	
	Importantly his parents’ separation was a significant point in his developmental history. He has reportedly, in accordance with his evidence, been involved with the wrong crowd, and also involved in gambling for some time.
	
	
	Ms Egan opined that the offender is at risk of developing a full Externalising Disorder and he is at a crossroads in his life where, with appropriate treatment, he may be able to deviate from this course. He is at some risk of re-offending if he fails to deal with his gambling addiction, his use of drugs, and also his psychological state.
	


OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS


	
	It has been submitted by the Crown, and I accept, that the Henry guidelines apply equally to an offence pursuant to s 97 of the Crimes Act. In this particular case the following matters referred to in the Henry guideline judgment are identified.
	
	
	The offender is young, with little or no criminal history, he is 26 years of age. He has an entry for an assault with intent to rob in the Children’s Court, which I can put to one side. He has two entries for unlicensed driving, and common assault in 2014 for which he received a s 9 bond, and a s 12 bond for seven months, respectively. I do not see those as being particularly significant.
	
	
	He was armed with a weapon, like a knife, capable of inflicting serious injury, in this case a 30 centimetre knife. There was a limited degree of planning. It is not suggested that this offences involved any degree of planning outside what is usual for these types of offences.
	
	
	There was limited actual violence, but a real threat thereof. In two offences there were threats of violence. In one, the offender used the tip of the knife against the victim’s thigh which caused a small cut. The victims in each case were vulnerable people in that they worked at service stations who, by virtue of their hours of work, were particularly vulnerable to robbery.
	
	
	In each case there was a small amount of money taken. In each case the Crown case was a strong one, particularly by reference to the presence of the closed circuit television.
	
	
	I note the guideline pronounced in Henry that the ranges of sentence for offences of this character should generally fall between four and five years for the full term, however aggravating and mitigating factors could justify a sentence below or above the range in the appropriate case.
	
	
	It was properly conceded by the Crown that the reference in Henry to the plea of guilty was as to a late plea of guilty, or the strength of the Crown case, and not a reference to the utilitarian value of the plea, and that in a proper case the utilitarian value of the plea is able to reduce the sentence provided for in the guideline judgment.
	
	
	General deterrence is obviously of some significance in these types of offences, and that is also referred to in the Henry guideline judgment. There is a need for specific deterrence in respect of this particular offender, particularly as there is some risk of recidivism if he does not deal appropriately with the issues which he is currently facing.
	
	
	In these matters the offender entered a plea at an early time, the Crown appropriately concedes that the discount should be the maximum available, in other words 25%. On his arrest the offender made admissions in the electronically recorded interview that also demonstrated, in my view, acceptance of responsibility for these offences, and genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. He has the good support of his family.
	
	
	This particular series of offences took place over 42 hours and seemed to be in stark contrast to the rest of his life. At the time of the offences he was employed in a very responsible position as a demolition supervisor. It was his use of ice, particularly in a large quantity, that gave rise to the offending conduct in these circumstances.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that with appropriate intervention that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. I have taken into account the principles of totality considering that these three offences were committed within a very short period of time, being some 42 hours, at a time when the offender was significantly under the effect of methylamphetamine.
	


SENTENCE


	
	I have considered s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.
	
	
	The appropriate term of imprisonment in relation to the two offences is one of four years, those terms of imprisonment will be discounted by 25% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I find that there are special circumstances by references to the offender’s need for rehabilitation of his gambling addiction, and also his addiction to methylamphetamine. He also needs further support by way of psychological counselling and treatment to ensure, firstly that he does not re-offend, and secondly that he does not fall into significant psychological difficulties in the future.
	
	
	Would you stand up please, Mr Toprak? In relation to sequence 1, being robbery armed with an offensive weapon the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of two years, to date from 21 October 2015.
	
	
	In relation to sequence 3, assault with intent to rob armed with an offensive weapon, the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 21 October 2016.
	
	
	The total effective sentence is one of four years with a non-parole period of two years and six months. The offender is eligible to be released on parole on 20 April 2018.
	
	
	Ms Roatz, which sequence does the Form 1 relate to?
	
	
	ROATZ: Sequence 2.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I have taken into account that charge in relation to sequence 2.

2701351,R v Hart (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 957,"Ex Tempore JUDGMENT (revised)


	
	Miss Olivia Bromham is giving evidence in the Crown case. In her evidence-in-chief she was asked whether she had had a phone call from a person named “Mick” about the sale of a pen gun. She was asked a question about that topic twice, I think, and on each occasion she denied having had a conversation with “Mick” on the night of the incident which led to Mr Hargrave's death. Rather, she said that it was Mr Hargrave, the deceased, who had had that conversation.
	
	
	She also explained that she had been very traumatised by the events of 29 October 2013 and I rather inferred from that, she was accepting, as had been put to her, that her memory about the events may have been affected by that circumstance.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor has sought leave to cross-examine Miss Broham about whether she has at any time made a statement inconsistent with the evidence she has given before me this afternoon.
	
	
	Mr Wilson of Senior Counsel accepts that the circumstances properly engage the s 38 discretion and does not otherwise wish to be heard.
	
	
	I am satisfied by reference to her statement dated 28 November 2013, which has been admitted as exhibit VD-D, that Miss Bromham has indeed made a prior inconsistent statement about this topic. I'm also satisfied that the topic is one relevant to the issues that the jury will have to decide in this case going, as it does, to providing a narrative of events closely associated in time with the shooting that resulted in Mr Hargrave's death and touching, as it does, upon questions which may inform the issue whether the accused had a motive for murder on the one hand, and, on the other, whether the deceased had some interest himself in acquiring a pen gun.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the circumstances set out at s 38(6) and at s 192 of the Evidence Act, I am satisfied that the Crown has not only engaged the exercise of my discretion, but has pointed to circumstances which justify granting leave for the learned Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine Miss Bromham on at least those parts of her statement that deal with that particular matter described above.
	
	
	Certainly the Crown gave notice at the first available opportunity to seek leave and it seems to me that although Mr Wilson will no doubt have several matters to cross-examine Miss Bromham about, that it is in the interests of justice that the Crown be given the opportunity to cross-examine her about this topic before Mr Wilson cross-examines.
	
	
	I am also satisfied that each of the matters referred to in s 192 of the Act, so far as is relevant, favours that decision. In particular, I accept the argument that the grant of leave at this stage will not add in any material way to the length of the trial and that it would be unfair to the Crown not to be able to cross-examine Miss Bromham about her denial of that circumstance.
	
	
	The evidence, as I have said, is of some relevance. It may not necessarily be of great importance in the overall circumstances of the case, but given the nature of these proceedings, that is to say a trial for murder, I think this matter should properly be tested, as it were, in the course of what otherwise would be the witness' evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	Accordingly, I grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine Miss Bromham as indicated in my reasons.

		26 July 2016",2016-07-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701360,Safe Work (NSW) v JSN Hanna Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 117,"sentence


	
	JSN Hanna Pty Limited (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Taiene Silva to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender operated a business providing building services. On 7 December 2012 the offender was the principal contractor for the development of a block of residential units in Lane Cove (the site).
	
	
	The offender sub-contracted the supply and installation of Architectural Framing System (AFS) panels at the site to Ultrafloor Australia Pty Ltd (Ultrafloor). Ultrafloor then engaged Davidson Group Installations Pty Ltd (DGI) to install the AFS walls. DGI engaged Ultra Wall Pty Ltd (Ultra Wall) to assist with the installation of the AFS wall panels.
	
	
	Mr Silva was a labourer employed by Ultra Wall and was 17 years of age at the time of the incident. He had only been working for about 3 months after completing his Higher School Certificate.
	
	
	On 7 December 2012, Mr Silva was working at the site assisting with the installation of AFS panels on the second floor. He had assisted in installing AFS panels at other sites, but had not installed any at the Lane Cove site prior to the date of the incident.
	
	
	Mr Silva was undertaking work on the second floor that required him to stand on a bay extension (or hop-up) scaffold in the lift shaft. The lift shaft extended over four floors, including two basement floors. The edge of the hop-up scaffold was unprotected. Mr Silva was in the process of bracing an AFS panel that was being installed in the lift shaft. In order to balance himself, Mr Silva placed his right foot onto a piece of timber which had been secured to the wall at floor height. The piece of timber was there in order to align the wall and to serve as formwork when the concrete was poured to fill the walls of the floor below. It was not intended to be weight bearing. The piece of timber gave way and Mr Silva fell approximately 12 metres.
	
	
	Mr Silva sustained a head wound requiring 12 stiches, swelling and lacerations to the face, neck pain and bruising. He was absent from work for 8 days and commenced work for another employer on 16 January 2013.
	
	
	There was a crane tower in the lift shaft on the western side. The gap between the crane tower and the scaffold (the gap through which Mr Silva fell) was approximately 500mm. The crane tower was not a working face. The gaps between the edge of the lift shaft and the crane tower on the other three sides were approximately 400mm. Handrails had been erected around the lift shaft, however on the date of the incident handrails had been removed at one side of the lift shaft which allowed access to the hop-up scaffold.
	
	
	Ultra Wall relied on the system of work used by DGI, who relied on the system of work implemented by Ultrafloor. The offender had received a copy of Ultrafloor’s safe work method statement (SWMS).
	
	
	The Ultrafloor SWMS identified the risk of falling from height and listed the main control measure as being the use of scaffolding that included handrails and physical guarding along perimeters and voids.
	
	
	Mr Silva was inducted onto the site by both the offender and DGI. He attended toolbox talks with Ultra Wall employees. Mr Silva was placed with more experienced Ultra Wall employees to show him how to carry out work on site. Ultra Wall did not provide its workers with any documented instructions, training or information.
	
	
	Ultrafloor provided its workers with safety equipment, showed them the dangers to be aware of on-site and conducted toolbox talks. DGI documented whether safety gear had been received by workers and whether they had a White Card. DGI also held toolbox talks, however these were not documented.
	
	
	The offender conducted regular site-inspections and held toolbox talks, however these were not documented.
	
	
	Following the incident handrails were installed around all sides of the lift shaft. The offender dismissed DGI and Ultra Wall, and engaged HD Projects Pty Ltd (HD Projects). The offender began documenting toolbox talks and required new workers to demonstrate their understanding of information during induction.
	


Standard


	
	At the time of the incident there was a relevant standard: AS/NZ Standard 1576:1:2010 Scaffolding General Requirements. The standard identified falling from height as a risk, with edge protection to be provided where a person could fall a distance exceeding 2 metres. Edge protection is not required if the scaffold is less than 225mm from a working face or less than 100mm from a building or structure that is not a working face.
	


The Offender’s Evidence


	
	The offender read an affidavit of Wadih Hanna, a director and the Project Manager of the offender, sworn 30 June 2016. Mr Hanna was present at the sentencing hearing but was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Hanna gave evidence that the offender, and a partnership that conducted an identical business prior to the offender’s incorporation, had been in operation for 45 years having been initially run by his father and uncles. Up until the incident, the offender had operated without any serious incidents. Mr Hanna deposed that the offender is a small family business that usually takes on one project at any one time.
	
	
	At the date of the incident the offender had in place a WHS Project Safety Plan (PSP). The PSP included site safety rules which provided that elevated works must be carried out in accordance with regulations, WorkCover directives, Codes of Practice and instructions of the offender. Copies of the site rules were displayed at the entrances to the site, lunch rooms and the site office.
	
	
	Mr Hanna deposed that the offender had previously built a number of other buildings requiring central lift shafts and the use of cranes. There was another building site next to the site which meant that placing the crane anywhere other than inside the lift shaft would affect nearby residents. For this reason the crane was placed in the lift shaft at the site.
	
	
	In around April 2012, the offender engaged Five Star Scaffolding to erect scaffolding on the site. In May 2012, Mr Hanna met with Mark Makari, the General Manager of Five Star Scaffolding, who was designing the scaffolding for the site. Mr Hanna informed Mr Makari that AFS panels would need to be used at the site and be moved via crane. Mr Hanna informed Mr Makari that there would need to be a clearance maintained between the crane tower and the scaffolding to allow for the sway of the crane tower.
	
	
	Mr Hanna deposed that at the time that the scaffolding was erected it was his understanding that it allowed sufficient clearance for the crane, that no person would work on the hop-up and that the hop-up would not be accessible to workers.
	
	
	Mr Hanna discussed with the contractors the manner in which AFS panels would be installed on site. This installation procedure was discussed at a toolbox talk attended by 10-15 workers. It is unknown whether Mr Silva was present at this meeting.
	
	
	It was Mr Hanna’s understanding that the contractors would carry out an on-site risk assessment prior to commencing any work. Such risk assessment would include a consideration of the risk of falling from height and ensuring that adequate control measures were in place.
	
	
	On the date of the incident Mr Hanna arrived on site at approximately 5am. Mr Hanna did not observe contractors working around the lift shaft but was available to be consulted if any concerns arose. At approximately 9am Mr Hanna was informed of the incident.
	
	
	Mr Hanna deposed that prior to the incident no person was allowed on-site without being inducted. These inductions included an outline of health and safety procedures, identification of risks specific to the worker’s role, and risk-management measures. Mr Silva was inducted into the site on 12 November 2012.
	
	
	Mr Hanna would conduct daily safety walks at the site to ensure that it was safe for workers prior to their arrival. Weekly documented site inspections were also undertaken.
	
	
	Mr Hanna ensured that toolbox talks were conducted to discuss site safety, and spoke to workers to confirm that they understood what work they had to perform and how to perform it.
	
	
	The offender, through Mr Hanna, accepts that it failed to:
	



	
	maintain safe scaffolding in and around the lift shaft;
	
	
	ensure that workers were directed not to work at height where there were inadequate fall protection measures; and
	
	
	ensure that Mr Silva had been instructed in safe work procedures for working at height near an unprotected gap of more than 225mm from an unguarded work face.
	



	
	Following the incident the offender took a number of steps including
	



	
	Installing additional scaffolding in the lift shaft;
	
	
	Commissioning a safety risk audit;
	
	
	Arranging for officers to complete additional WHS training;
	
	
	Conducting spot checks of workers to ensure compliance with safety requirements;
	
	
	Making WHS compliance a fundamental condition of the contract with sub-contractors;
	
	
	Employing a full-time Site Safety Co-Ordinator and Compliance Officer; and
	
	
	Reviewing Work Health and Safety systems and practices.
	



	
	Mr Hanna deposed that the offender has made a number of donations to charities and community events giving over $80,000 between 2010 and 2016 to a range of organisations. The offender also supports MATES in Construction which aims to reduce suicide rates among construction workers.
	
	
	Mr Jim Hanna and Mr Edward Hanna, officers of the offender, were also present at the sentence hearing.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness of the Offence


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less than the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The prosecutor submitted that the offence was not below the mid-range of objective seriousness for 5 reasons. First, the foreseeability of the risk was obvious by reference to the existence and terms of the Standard. There was a 500mm gap between the edge of the hop-up and the crane tower, and Mr Silva was required to work in that area when he fell. Second, the measures to eliminate the risk were simple and readily available. They were the provision of adequate guardrails on the hop-up. Third, the foreseeable risk was a risk of death. The risk was of a fall of 12m in height onto a concrete base with a number of vertical steel structures in that area. Fourth, the failure was a failure to devise a safe system of work rather than a failure to ensure its implementation. Fifth, Mr Silva had only been employed for 3 months and had not previously done this type of work. Although he had been given a general site induction and trained on the content of the SWMS he had not been trained as to the specific risk.
	
	
	In response the offender accepted that the fall from an unprotected edge was obvious and it had been extensively addressed in the SWMS, on which Mr Silva had been trained. Mr Hanna’s evidence was that the hop-up was not intended to be a work platform, but was intended to narrow the gap in the lift shaft adjacent to the crane, as was necessary to allow for the safe operation of the crane. The offender accepted that by providing the hop-up, it allowed it to be used as a work platform. The offender also relied on the input of the other professional contractors on the site. The documented safety systems for the site were extensive and overlapping. Ultrafloor had conducted an independent risk assessment that was documented. It was a term of the contract with Ultrafloor that the offender would provide the scaffolding and that Ultrafloor would not commence or continue work if inadequate and/or unsafe scaffolding was provided. The offender engaged a reputable contractor to supply and install the scaffolding. The existence of the hop-up was not thought to present a risk to safety by Ultrafloor, DGI or Ultra Wall before the accident. The offender submitted that the matter was between the low and mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The risk was obvious if the hop-up was intended to be used as a work platform, but less so in the circumstances of this case. In the absence of guard rails it was objectively foreseeable that it could have been used as a work platform. The provision of guard rails would have gone close to eliminating the risk. The risk was a risk of death or serious injury. The injuries sustained by Mr Silva were not substantial. The offender had introduced layers of safety measures to be implemented by a number of PCBU’s on the site. They all failed leading up to the incident and the culpability of the offender was not as high as some of the other entities involved. The implementation of the extensive steps taken by the offender to ensure safety had the effect of reducing its moral culpability for the offence. In my view the offence is below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence in this sentencing exercise because the offender continues to operate a business involving high risk construction work and thereby has responsibility for the safety of its employees, contractors and visitors to its sites.
	
	
	The need for specific deterrence is substantially reduced by reference to the extensive efforts of the offender to comply with the Act. It was engaged in high risk construction work as defined by clause 299 Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011. It had adopted a written SWMS as it was required to do. It also entered into contractual arrangements to require the contractors engaged on the site to provide a comprehensive risk assessment, the provision of a written SWMS and the implementation of training of workers on its content. The effect was a layering of the usual safety measures on the site. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender’s lack of antecedents was as a result of its attitude and comprehensive approach to safety. I have come to the conclusion, for reasons developed later, that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. However, I do not believe that this is an exceptional case in which specific deterrence can be disregarded: Bulga at [178].
	


Aggravating factors


	
	The prosecutor submitted that Mr Silva was vulnerable by reason of his age and lack of experience in the building industry: section 21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In response, the offender submitted that Mr Silva was required by the SWMS to have undertaken an occupational health and safety general induction for construction work to be eligible to work on the site. That training is general training on the types of dangers present in the construction industry. In addition, he was taken through a site induction on the SWMS that contained multiple references to the risk of falling from height and other dangers.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the training provided to Mr Silva was sufficient to remove the necessary element of vulnerability required to establish the aggravating factor and I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it has been established.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The injury and emotional harm caused by the offence was not substantial: section 21A(3)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Whilst the risk was one of death, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the actual harm suffered Mr Silva was not substantial. He suffered a head wound requiring 12 stitches, facial lacerations, swelling of the face and pain and bruising to his neck. He returned to work 8 days after the accident and there is no evidence of any ongoing effect on him.
	
	
	The offender does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that the offender has operated the business since 2006. It is also appropriate to consider that the business was operated by the partnership before that for about 45 years, without incident. The business was one that for most of the relevant period conducted high risk construction work, which was inherently dangerous to the workers engaged.
	
	
	The offender was a person of good character: section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is a good corporate citizen. It employs a number of people and has supported charitable causes and works. The statement of Mr Crompton, an employee of Ultrafloor, provided to Safework during the course of the investigation provides evidence that the offender was well regarded in the industry and had a reputation as a safe and responsible entity.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender took immediate and comprehensive steps to improve its safety systems at the site following the incident. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the occurrence of the accident will encourage the offender to more carefully scrutinise its operations regarding the safety of workers engaged in it and that the offender is unlikely to re-offend.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender, through the evidence of Mr Hanna, has accepted responsibility for its actions that led to the injury to Mr Silva. The offender has expressed remorse for its failures and breach of the safety laws. The offender has acknowledged the impact the accident would have had on Mr Silva. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has expressed genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty: sections 21A(3)(k) and 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of that discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32]. I have had regard to the chronology of these proceedings provided by the prosecutor. I accept that some of the delay was occasioned by the financial position of Ultrafloor; it ultimately went into liquidation and the proceedings against it were discontinued. There was also a period in which negotiations relating to the provision of an enforceable undertaking were pursued. However, the matter was listed for trial twice and the plea of guilty was entered after the filing of an amended summons, removing some of the particulars of breach of duty. The appropriate discount is 12.5%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Penalty


	
	The offender’s subjective case is a compelling one. I am satisfied that it had an impeccable safety record because it paid close attention to providing a safe workplace. The offender had taken extensive steps to comply with the Act and the Regulations. In this respect it was a good example to other PCBU’s performing high risk construction work.
	
	
	The provision of the unguarded hop-up was an oversight in the implementation of the safety system. I accept the evidence of Mr Hanna that it was never intended to be a work platform. However, its lack of appropriate guard rails allowed it to become a work platform and that created a substantial risk that manifested in the accident involving Mr Silva.
	
	
	I must impose an appropriate penalty to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, but the penalty is significantly mitigated by reference to the subjective case of the offender. I have also taken into account the quantum of the prosecutor’s costs to be paid by the offender, in setting the amount of the fine: Environmental Protection Agency v Barnes [2006] NSWCCA 246 at [78].
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $100,000 that will be discounted by 12.5% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $87,500.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed of $70,000.

		04 July 2016",2016-07-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701364,Bullock v R [2016] NSWCCA 131,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Rothman J and with his reasons. I also agree with the reasons of Fagan J.
	
	
	The applicant complained that the sentencing judge failed to make a finding as to the objective gravity of the offending. That was not required. What was required was a careful assessment of the nature of the offending conduct; that exercise was properly undertaken by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Although the offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) carries a standard non-parole period (7 years) and that period is identified as representing the non-parole period for an offence “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” for such an offence, [1]  it was common ground that the judge was entitled to depart from that guideline in the present case. The critical factors warranting departure will be noted below. As the standard non-parole period is an identified number of years, the concept of “the middle of the range” must be treated as a band sufficiently narrow to warrant a single figure. On the other hand, the exercise of placing a particular case at a precise point on a scale involves a degree of arbitrariness which need not be engaged in if the statute does not require it. It did not so require in the present case.
	
	
	The sentencing judge described the offence as “serious”, a characterisation which the applicant correctly noted appeared to refer to offences of sexual assault which carry a maximum term of 14 years imprisonment. It may be inferred that the sentencing judge, correctly, treated the current offending as neither at the low end of the range (warranting unusual leniency) nor at the high end of the range (approaching an aggravated form of the offence). The offending involved a degree of force and persistence which were noted by the sentencing judge, but which did not require further characterisation.
	
	
	The critical factors in favour of the applicant were his age and immaturity and his immediate realisation that he had done something very wrong, which led him to plead at an early stage to the charge laid against him.
	
	
	The early plea allowed him a discount of 25% from an otherwise appropriate sentence, in accordance with s 22 of the Sentencing Procedure Act and established practice.
	
	
	His age and immaturity, combined with the fact that he had no prior record and that this would be his first period of incarceration, warranted a further significant element of leniency.
	
	
	The sentence of five years imprisonment proposed by Rothman J (with which I agree) does not disregard the statutory guidelines. That may be explained by reference to the factors favouring leniency and the standard non-parole period. Given the statutory presumption that, absent special circumstances, the non-parole period should be no less than 75% of the overall sentence, [2]  a notional head sentence, calculated by reference to the 7 year standard non-parole period, would be 9 years 4 months. Reducing that figure by 25% for a plea of guilty would give a notional head sentence of 7 years. Allowing a similar further reduction on account of the other factors noted above would provide a head sentence of 5 years. While it is not suggested that such a mechanical exercise is, or should be, engaged in by a court fixing a sentence, the exercise demonstrates that the sentence does not disregard the statutory guideline.
	
	
	The finding of special circumstances, based on considerations relevant to the applicant, including his sound prospects of rehabilitation, warrant a significant departure from the statutory provision as to the relationship between the non-parole period and the additional term.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: The Applicant, Justin Bullock, was sentenced for one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 and now seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him and, if leave be granted, to have the sentence reduced.
	
	
	Briefly, the offence was committed in the early hours of 31 May 2014 when the Applicant forced himself onto the complainant who, notwithstanding her intoxication, had resisted his advances and screamed for help. Others heard the screaming and interrupted the offence.
	
	
	During the offence the Applicant had occasioned digital and penile penetration of the vagina of the complainant, who suffered bruising to her lip, thighs, neck and vagina.
	
	
	The Applicant, who was also intoxicated at the time of the offence, handed himself into police the next morning and was charged. The Applicant entered a plea of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity, for which the sentencing judge discounted the sentence by 25%. The Applicant gave short evidence at the sentencing hearing, expressing remorse. The sentencing judge sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for six years commencing 17 April 2015, with a non-parole period of three years and six months, concluding 16 October 2018.
	
	
	The only ground of appeal is manifest excess. As earlier stated, the sentencing judge discounted the sentence to be imposed by 25% for the plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and accepted that the Applicant was remorseful. The Applicant had no previous convictions and he had sound prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	At the time of the offence the Applicant was 18 years and two months old and had just turned 19 years at the time of the sentence.
	
	
	Psychiatric reports pointed to a number of disorders that may be suffered by the Applicant.
	
	
	The Applicant had been released on bail at the time of his arrest and remained on bail until his sentence commenced. The Applicant entered a plea of guilty on 15 October 2014, was sentenced on 17 April 2015 to a period of imprisonment commencing 17 April 2015.
	


Facts


	
	It is necessary to detail the circumstances surrounding the offence and the conduct that gave rise to the offence in more detail than the previous summary.
	
	
	The sentencing hearing proceeded on agreed facts to which the sentencing judge referred and to a small extent summarised in his Remarks.
	
	
	The Applicant and complainant had known each other for approximately 12 months and were friends. They are not and never have been in an intimate relationship. They would often communicate via text message and Facebook messages.
	
	
	On Wednesday 28 May 2014, an exchange of messages occurred between the Applicant and the complainant using text. The import of the messages was enquiries made by the complainant as to the whereabouts of others; a statement by the complainant that she missed a particular other person and on prompting missed the Applicant; an enquiry by the Applicant as to whether they could be more than friends, including the possibility of a sexual liaison; and an emphatic rejection of such a proposal by the complainant with the comment that, “We’re just friends, mate” and, on a request for further and better particulars, a statement by the complainant that she liked another and, “You’re not my type and we’re just friends”.
	
	
	The complainant expressed the view that she does not understand why the Applicant likes her and there are many others with whom he might have a relationship and a comment by the Applicant that the others were not like the complainant.
	
	
	As at 30 May 2014, the Applicant was residing with a friend in the Central Coast in a garage detached from the main house. The complainant would, from time to time, stay overnight in the garage, sleeping in the bed of the friend (i.e. not the Applicant).
	
	
	On 30 May 2014, the Applicant, the complainant and another friend were at the house. At 3pm the three of them attended at an inspection for a rental property nearby after which, the friend returned to her home, but on the basis that she planned to return later that evening.
	
	
	The Applicant and the complainant went to a bottle shop where the Applicant purchased two bottles of vodka: one for the complainant. They returned to the house where the complainant spoke with two other persons and commenced drinking vodka mixed with tropical fruit juice.
	
	
	The complainant was moving back and forth between the main house and the garage, where the Applicant and some others were drinking and listening to music. The Applicant was observed to commence drinking at around 6.30pm or 7pm. At around this time, the third person who attended the inspection returned with another juvenile.
	
	
	The Applicant’s brother lived in a house directly across the street. At approximately 7.30pm, the complainant went to the brother’s house where other people were drinking, dancing and listening to music. She was wearing a black and white dress, with denim shorts underneath, and underwear.
	
	
	Over the course of the evening, the complainant drank approximately three-quarters of the bottle of vodka and by midnight she was very intoxicated.
	
	
	Just after midnight on 30/31 May 2014, a group of the complainant’s friends decided to walk to a convenience store that was nearby. The complainant did not accompany them as she felt too drunk and wanted to go to sleep. The complainant walked back to the residence, being the main house, in the garage of which the Applicant was residing.
	
	
	The complainant left the main house at approximately 1.30am and went to the garage. One of the residents of the main house on the property came out to the garage a couple of minutes later and observed the complainant lying on the bed on which she normally slept, when she slept over. At that time, the Applicant was in the garage seated at his computer.
	
	
	The resident of the main property informed the Applicant that the doors were required to be locked for the night. The complainant bade the resident goodnight, whereupon the resident left the garage and returned to the main house.
	
	
	The complainant said to the Applicant, “I’m going to bed”. The Applicant replied, “Okay, goodnight”. The complainant climbed under the doona of the bed on which she was lying and went to sleep.
	
	
	Sometime later, the complainant awoke in the dark to the sensation of someone on top of her on the bed. She was lying on her back and felt as if she was “pinned down”. The person was kissing her on the lips. The garage light was off. The complainant said, “What the fuck?” and heard a male voice say “It’s Matty”. Matty was the nickname of the occupier of the garage, other than the Applicant.
	
	
	The complainant immediately recognised this as the Applicant’s voice. She pushed him away from her with both her hands on his chest, moved out from underneath him and slid onto the floor. The complainant walked towards the garage door past the Applicant’s bed.
	
	
	The Applicant was then in front of the complainant. The Applicant grabbed the complainant on the top of both of her arms and pushed her down onto his bed. He then got on top of her and pinned her down with his body. He held her arms above her head. The Applicant screamed and the Applicant then placed one of his hands over her mouth to stop her from screaming.
	
	
	The Applicant began kissing the complainant on her neck and touching her breasts. The Applicant put his hand down the front of the complainant’s denim shorts, inside her underwear and digitally penetrated her. The complaint screamed very loudly. The Applicant then leaned over and put his head up against the complainant’s face, putting her lip in between his teeth. With one hand he was holding the complainant’s hands above her head, and his other hand was still down her shorts.
	
	
	The complainant managed to get one of her hands free from the Applicant’s grasp and she pushed him hard to the shoulder to try to get him off her. She said, “Stop, please”. The Applicant told her to “Shush”.
	
	
	The Applicant then pulled his hand out of the complainant’s shorts and put his hand over her mouth again. The complainant struggled to breathe because the Applicant’s hand was blocking her nose and mouth. She felt dizzy. She said, “Can you please stop, I won’t scream”. The Applicant took his hand from her mouth. The complainant then screamed as loudly as she could and ran for the garage door. She tried to undo the latch. She removed the latch and threw it at the Applicant. The Applicant grabbed it and threw it onto his bed. The Applicant then grabbed the complainant around the mouth and swung her around so that she fell back onto the bed.
	
	
	The Applicant pulled the complainant’s shorts and underwear down and off and placed them nearby. He then pulled down his pants. The complainant grabbed her underwear and stuffed them down her shirt. The Applicant again held the complainant down with his hands holding onto her arms. The complainant tried to scream but nothing came out. The Applicant placed his penis into the complainant’s vagina and started thrusting. The complainant wiggled her body to try and get out from underneath the Applicant. The complainant did not see whether the Applicant was wearing a condom or whether he ejaculated.
	
	
	The other four friends had, as a group, gone to the convenience store. They were gone for approximately 40 minutes, returning before 1am on the morning of 31 May 2014. The group did not walk all of the way to the convenience store and decided to return to the house. As they walked along the street they stopped outside the residence and garage and were talking. They all heard the sound of a female screaming. At first, three of the four thought it was the complainant “being stupid” because she was intoxicated. As a consequence, they ignored the scream.
	
	
	A short time later they heard another scream. Two of them ran to the garage and opened the door. One of those two observed the Applicant jump off the complainant and jump under the blankets. She noticed that he was naked from the waist down. The complainant leapt out of the Applicant’s bed and ran from the garage screaming and crying. The complainant ran down the driveway and stopped to put her underwear back on. She collapsed in the middle of the street between the residence that contained the garage and the Applicant’s brother’s house. The complainant said, “He raped me, Justin raped me”.
	
	
	The two that had gone to assist in the garage assisted the complainant across the street and into the Applicant’s brother’s house, where she sat down on a bed. The complainant told the brother, “Justin raped me”. The brother said, “I’m gonna get him” and ran across the road to locate the Applicant. The Applicant was not there.
	
	
	One of the residents of the main residence, who had heard screaming at about 2.30am, walked out of the front of the house, saw the complainant standing across the road in a singlet and underwear, crying and screaming.
	
	
	The other resident, who was asleep in the main house, was awoken by the complainant screaming. He heard the complainant scream, “He raped me”. The commotion caused him to get out of bed upon which he saw the complainant and some of the other girls outside. He observed the complainant crying, curled up in a foetal position, shaking and sweating. She was being comforted by the brother and the other girls. He could not see the Applicant.
	
	
	Police and an ambulance were called and they arrived shortly after. The complainant was conveyed to hospital and police attended Gosford Hospital to obtain a version of events from the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant was examined at the hospital by Dr Collins. She observed that the complainant had peri-oral swelling and redness around her upper lip area which was stinging to the touch. The Doctor also observed a two centimetre tender bruise on the complainant’s front upper thigh and two two-centimetre bruises on the side of the complainant’s thigh. The complainant also had linear abrasions on her back. An examination of the complainant’s vagina revealed bi-lateral redness and multiple small fissures.
	
	
	Police at the scene of the incident searched for the Applicant, but could not find him.
	
	
	The following morning, Saturday 31 May 2014, the Applicant presented himself to the police station with his mother and grandfather. On questioning from police, the Applicant stated that he had no memory of the events of the previous night, except running away from the house and that he woke up, that morning, in the bush. He could not say anything about the allegation of sexual intercourse with the complainant.
	
	
	The Applicant did tell police that he had been communicating with the complainant on Facebook in relation to offers that she made to have sex with him in exchange for money to which he replied that he wanted to be in a relationship with her but she had said no, only for money.
	
	
	A print out of the Facebook chat logs between the Applicant and the complainant from 19 October 2013 to 30 May 2014 revealed no such communication.
	


Submissions and Remarks on Sentence


	
	Only one ground of appeal has been raised, being that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. As earlier stated, the sentencing judge provided the Applicant with a 25% discount on sentence for his early plea of guilty to the offence. As a consequence, the starting point for the head sentence was 8 years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Essentially, the Applicant submits that the sentencing judge failed to assess the objective seriousness of the offence properly and that insufficient weight was given to the Applicant’s subjective circumstances, in particular his youth and emotional immaturity.
	
	
	The Applicant, in submissions, cited sentencing statistics that evidenced:
	



	
	Of all of the 135 offenders sentenced for one offence against s61I of the Crimes Act, between July 2008 and June 2016 (which includes the Applicant’s sentence), 76% of those offenders received a lesser head sentence than the Applicant;
	
	
	If the statistics were confined to those offenders with no prior record of which there were 51 offenders, 92% of them received a lesser sentence than the Applicant;
	
	
	There were 31 offenders with no prior record and who had pleaded guilty, none of whom received a head sentence beyond five years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	Of the 14 offenders who had pleaded guilty and were aged between 18 and 20 years (including the Applicant), 72% received a lesser head sentence (including those that had prior offences);
	
	
	Of the six offenders who had pleaded guilty, who had no prior criminal offences and were aged between 18 and 20 years, none had received a head sentence beyond three and half years.
	



	
	The Crown submissions dealt with the proportion of non-parole period and the findings of objective seriousness of the offence, reminding the Court that there was a dearth of submissions at the sentencing hearing from the accused relating to the category of objective seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the judge’s reference to it being a “serious offence” should be read in the foregoing context and in the context that the offence had occurred when the complainant had been asleep and vulnerable to the Applicant’s attack, both for that reason and because she was intoxicated. Further, a degree of violence was inflicted.
	
	
	As is obvious from the foregoing, the sentencing judge found special circumstance based upon the Applicant’s youth and his need for an extended period of supervision. The sentencing judge also remarked:
	


“[that the Applicant] took advantage of this girl who was asleep, vulnerable and probably affected by alcohol. Although it was not premeditated, certainly what was premeditated was his sexual interest in her which is reflected in the material.”


	
	Further the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was remorseful and regretful and found that there were sound prospects for rehabilitation. He also noted that he is a young man who needs psychological assistance.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act is 14 years’ imprisonment and the legislature has established a standard non-parole period of seven years. The Applicant pleaded guilty and the standard non-parole period does not apply, but both it and the maximum penalty remain guideposts in the fixing of an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the sentencing judge provided a discount of 25% on account of a plea of guilty and its utilitarian effect. He mentioned contrition reflected in the plea of guilty and remorse that was expressed in the witness box, which the sentencing judge accepted.
	
	
	On one view of the comment as to contrition and remorse, it may be that the sentencing judge seems to have considered that the 25% discount may have covered those factors. Nevertheless, no express statement to that effect was made. As was the case, the sentencing judge noted that the Applicant had no prior convictions and was 18 years of age at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge also noted that the offence was not premeditated but seems to have taken into account that he had a long standing sexual interest in the complainant which the sentencing judge described as “premeditated”. It is not immediately apparent how one would take that into account. The sentencing judge compared that situation to a person who “jumped out from behind a bush in a street”. It is unclear whether the sentencing judge was comparing it favourably or unfavourably.
	
	
	It is not clear whether the sentencing judge was implying that, as a consequence of the fact that the Applicant knew the complainant, there was a breach of trust or whether some other aspect arose as a consequence.
	
	
	While the sentencing judge noted the immaturity of the Applicant and the subjective circumstances of being bullied at school when he was young, the sentencing judge commented that “the mere fact that a person is the victim of violence himself or herself does not mean that they necessarily avoid doing the same sort of thing”.
	


Consideration


	
	The Applicant points to no finding of fact that is wrong or reliance by the sentencing judge on any mistaken view of the facts. Nor does the Applicant rely upon the judge failing to rely on any principle or rely upon any mistake of principle. In other words, as the ground of appeal makes clear, the applicant relies on manifest error.
	
	
	Manifest error occurs when a sentence is excessive (or lenient) to an extent that the result discloses an error of principle or the misapplication of principle or some mistake of fact, even though none can be identified. In relying upon manifest excess, the Applicant must show that the discretion exercised by the sentencing judge miscarried, resulting in a sentence beyond the range of sentences available for the offence and taking account of the subjective circumstance of the Applicant. It is insufficient, in order to justify this Court intervening to correct a sentence, for the Court to come to a view that it would have sentenced differently or less severely or given less or more weight to one or more factors. [3] 
	
	
	The High Court, in Markarian v The Queen [4]  said:
	


“As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentence allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentence not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender’s appeal, as ‘manifest excess’, or in a prosecution appeal, as ‘manifest inadequacy’.” [5]  [Citations omitted]


	
	As earlier stated, the Applicant is a first time offender who pleaded guilty. As a consequence the standard non-parole period, while relevant to sentencing, does not apply to the Applicant.
	
	
	Further, the Applicant was only just over 18 years of age at the time of the offence. Sentencing a youth, even one that has reached majority, may require a different approach than the sentencing of an adult. In R v AEM Snr & Ors, [6]  the Court said:
	


“It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation…. However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.”


	
	The principle that a Court shall treat a youth more like an adult, where the youth conducts himself in the way an adult might and commits a crime of considerable gravity, does not mean that every crime of considerable gravity is one in which the youth has conducted himself in the way an adult might. The question is always one of seeking to synthesise the principles of sentencing. Punishment, general and specific deterrence and condemnation are some of the principles. Rehabilitation is another. Rehabilitation, in the case of youth acting immaturely, plays a far more significant role.
	
	
	In BP v R, [7]  Hodgson JA said:
	


“[4]    First, statements that, in relation to young offenders, principles of retribution may be of less significance and considerations of rehabilitation may be of more significance, may tend to obscure the point that even in relation to retribution the youth of an offender may be a mitigating circumstance. In my understanding, considerations of retribution direct attention to what the offender deserves; and in my opinion, where emotional immaturity or a young person’s less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour contributes to the offending, this may be seen as mitigating culpability and thus as reducing what is suggested by considerations of retribution: see TM v R [2008] NSWCCA 158 at [33] – [36].

[5]    Second, while I agree with the statements in KT at [26] that the weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person’s youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity, and that a ‘child offender’ of almost 18 years cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over 18 years of age, it does not follow that the age of maturity is 18 (albeit that for certain purposes the law does draw a line there: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987). In my understanding, emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively during adolescence and early adulthood, and may not be fully developed until the early to mid twenties: see R v Slade [2005] NZCA 19; [2005] 2 NZLR 526 at [43], quoted by Kirby J in R v Elliott [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1 at 27 [127]. As shown by R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, youth may be a material factor in sentencing even a 19 year old for a most serious crime.

[6]    Third, I do not think courts should be over-ready to discount the relevance of an offender’s youth on the basis that the offender has engaged in adult behaviour or acted as an adult. In the present case, the offence is a very serious one; but it did not involve significant planning or reflection, or any other indicia of mature decision-making. The applicant was 16 years old, and in my opinion the circumstances of the offence suggest rather that emotional immaturity and less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulses were likely to be contributing factors.”


	
	As the Court has made clear on a number of occasions, a youth who is not a minor, must be sentenced bearing in mind the youth and immaturity of the offender. While the regime for minors is different from the regime for persons over 18 years of age, a person, such as the Applicant in these proceedings, who is only just over 18 years of age, should be treated similarly to a person who may be three months younger.
	
	
	In dealing with a young person, whether or not of majority, it is unnecessary for the sentencing judge to set out the principles for sentencing young persons at any great length. Nevertheless, it is necessary for the sentencing judge to pay regard, not only to the youth of the Applicant as such, but to the effect of that youth.
	
	
	The sentencing judge refers to the Applicant being young and to the Applicant’s immaturity. He does not refer to the effect of the youth and immaturity on the Applicant for the purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	Rather, the sentencing judge refers to deterrence, general and specific, in a way which suggests that deterrence is the most important element. For youth acting immaturely, rehabilitation plays a far more significant role and retribution and deterrence play a less significant role.
	
	
	As Hodgson JA [8]  points out, see above, even in relation to retribution the emotional immaturity of a young person and a less than fully developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour may contribute to the offending and may mitigate culpability.
	
	
	Lastly, I deal with the evidence of comparable sentences. In Green & Quinn v The Queen, [9]  the High Court referred to the term equal justice embodying “the norm expressed in the term ‘equality before the law’” as “an aspect of the rule of law”. It requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical and it requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect. I would add that the difference in outcome needs rationally to reflect the difference in the relevant respect.
	
	
	Further, the High Court made clear that consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is a reflection of the notion of equal justice and fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice.
	
	
	Different sentences may be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances and apply to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events. The consistency that the latter requires is a consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles and not some mathematical equivalence.
	
	
	Further, the application of statistical analysis, blindly and without regard to the particular circumstances of cases, leads to an artificial limitation on the range of sentences available to be imposed. Nevertheless, some regard must be had to the range of sentences that are imposed on persons in like circumstances.
	
	
	As is summarised above, the Applicant’s submissions point out, correctly, that no offender who was convicted of one offence only and had no prior offences and pleaded guilty had imposed upon him or her, a non-parole period of greater than three years. When one factors in an age group of 18 to 20 years of age, no offender received a head sentence beyond three and a half years.
	
	
	As earlier stated, one must be very careful with statistics of that kind. In the case of 18 to 20 year old offenders on a first offence with no priors and a plea of guilty, there were only six such offenders included in the statistical analysis. Further, the sentences would include the discount for a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Nevertheless, if one takes out the age factor and looks only at offenders who had no prior record, of which there were 51, 92% of them received lesser head sentences than the Applicant in these proceedings. Of those 51 offenders, 31 had no prior record and pleaded guilty and of those, none received a head sentence beyond five years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In this case, the sentencing judge fixed a starting point (that is, before applying the discount for the plea of guilty) of eight years’ imprisonment as a head sentence. For an offender with no prior offences, who pleaded guilty to the charge and was only just of majority, that starting point is beyond the range ordinarily applied.
	
	
	The foregoing does not discount the serious damage done to the complainant in these proceedings. Nor does it underestimate the seriousness of the offence and the debilitating effect of such an intrusion and such abuse on a young person, particularly the effect that she can no longer trust her friends as she did before. Such a feeling is necessarily a not unusual effect of such a serious intrusive offence. This is a very serious offence with obvious long-term effects on the victim/complainant. People, particularly women, should be able to go to sleep in peace without being set upon by some person with an unrequited fixation. The Court must condemn this violence in strong terms.
	
	
	Nevertheless, when one takes into account the principles that apply to a youth, just over the age of 18, who has plainly acted wholly immaturely and as a child without the adult capacity to control impulsive behaviour, together with the leniency that a first offender otherwise might be shown, the sentence imposed, and the starting point of eight years’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The excessive outcome may be due to a failure to apply the principles relevant to the sentencing of a person of this age and the necessity to give greater significance to rehabilitation than to retribution. It may have resulted from a failure to accord the leniency associated with a first offender. It may simply be that the sentencing judge did not pay appropriate regard to the range of sentences imposed in comparable cases. It is difficult to ascertain precisely where error has been made. Nevertheless, the outcome reflects an error of principle or a misapplication of principle and manifest error.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, it is necessary, should the Court accept the orders that I propose, for the Applicant to be re-sentenced. I take into account the subjective factors to which the sentencing judge referred. I also take account of the principles in sentencing a person of immature mind and a young age, just over the age of 18 and the leniency which a first offender ought to be shown.
	
	
	I also allow a 25% discount for a plea of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and find, for the reasons expressed by the sentencing judge, that a longer period under supervision is appropriate. I shorten the non-parole period to allow for a longer period during which the Applicant is eligible for parole. I take account of the comparable cases to which the Applicant and the Crown have referred the Court.
	
	
	The statistics must also be used carefully because when comparing an offender in this category to other offenders, the statistics will generally reflect a discount applied for the plea of guilty in the sentence that is recorded.
	
	
	The offence is a serious one. Notwithstanding the intoxicated state of the offender, it involved violence and an overpowering of a person who was weaker and vulnerable. It also involved both digital and penile penetration and was extremely intrusive. A full-time custodial sentence is plainly warranted. I would fix a starting sentence of six (6) years’ and eight (8) months’ imprisonment, to be reduced by the 25% for the early plea of guilty. The sentence I propose is still longer than any other sentence imposed on offenders for similar offences and with these subjective circumstances that are shown on the statistics, but any less would not reflect the serious nature of the offence. Other comparable sentences have been more severe, but I agree with the analysis of Fagan J and his comments, to which I have, since drafting these reasons, had access.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal allowed;
	
	
	Sentence imposed on Justin Bullock on 17 April 2015 be quashed and, in lieu thereof, for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the Applicant, Justin Bullock, be sentenced to a non-parole period of two (2) years and six (6) months commencing 17 April 2015 and concluding 16 October 2017 with a remainder of term of two (2) years and six (6) months concluding 16 April 2020.
	
	
	The Applicant is first eligible for release on parole on 16 October 2017.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Rothman J that the sentence imposed in the District Court was manifestly excessive. It was significantly more severe than sentences which have been imposed or upheld by this Court in respect of other offenders in circumstances which should be regarded as comparable, after making due allowance for individual features of this case and differences from the facts considered in past decisions. The manifest excessiveness, if not corrected, would constitute an inconsistency in the administration of the criminal law with respect to sentencing for offences against s 61I Crimes Act.
	
	
	For the purposes of determining an appropriate sentence for the applicant and of comparing the circumstances of his case with those of others which have come before this Court, the essential features of the present appeal may be enumerated as follows:
	



	
	The sexual intercourse took the form of full penile vaginal penetration.
	
	
	Significant force was used to overcome physical resistance of the complainant.
	
	
	The complainant was heavily affected by alcohol.
	
	
	The offender was 18 years of age at the time of the offence.
	
	
	The complainant was close in age to the offender, being 17 years, and the two were well known to each other and had socialised over the preceding 12 months.
	
	
	The complainant was not only injured in the course of the sexual assault but was very seriously distressed by it and suffered continuing psychological impact.
	
	
	The applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was entitled to a 25% discount on the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.
	



	
	In Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213 the sexual assault was less serious in physical terms, not involving penetration. The offender and victim in that case were close in age (22 years and 20 years, respectively) and were well known to each other. The offender pleaded guilty and was entitled to a 25% discount. This Court considered a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of 10 months appropriate. In giving the principal judgment Leeming JA at [51]-[54] considered, amongst other cases, McCartney v R [2009] NSWCCA 244, and Badans v R [2012] NSWCCA 97, both of which involved full penile vaginal intercourse where the offender and victim were known to each other socially and were close in age.
	
	
	In McCartney v R the physical acts were less serious than those in the present case because the offender desisted in the face of resistance. In Badans v R the offender forced himself upon the complainant whilst she slept. Mitigating subjective circumstances included that the offender had very low cognitive capacity, to a degree which was significant to his culpability.
	
	
	Each of these three cases was broadly comparable with the present but in each of them there were features of the objective conduct or of the offender’s subjective circumstances, or both, which rendered the offending less seriously punishable than in the present case.
	
	
	In BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 the offence against s 61l was constituted by sexual intercourse by a young male of an age close to that of his victim. The offender was almost 17 years old, the victim 19. As in the present case the offender and the victim had socialised during the evening in question and the offender had then forcibly penetrated the victim vaginally whilst she was heavily intoxicated. The offender was entitled to more consideration on account of his youth than the present applicant. His background in a highly dysfunctional Aboriginal family was also given weight towards reduction of sentence. On the other hand he had a criminal record including a previous aggravated sexual assault. He had defended the subject charge and was therefore not entitled to a discount. On re-sentence this Court imposed a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years. For purposes of comparison, if he had pleaded guilty and received a 25% discount there would have been a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. Making due allowance for some circumstances of BP v R which warranted a higher penalty than in the present case and some features which tended the other way, overall the criminality and the warranted degree of punishment were quite closely comparable between BP v R and the present case.
	
	
	In Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 123 the offence against s 61I was committed by digital penetration over the protests and physical resistance of the complainant. The offender and the complainant were aged 21 years and about 23 years respectively and had been in a relationship for some years. They had a three month old baby. On the evening of the offence the complainant informed the offender that their relationship was over. He responded by forcing himself upon her violently, in the manner above described. There was an early plea of guilty and a 25% discount was allowed. The offender came from a broken home, had a history of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and had had one psychotic episode. He was diagnosed with depression at about the time of or soon after the offence. A non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months was imposed with a balance of term of 1 year and 10 months. A severity appeal was dismissed. Again, making due allowance for variances between the two cases (in both directions with respect to the level of penalty called for) Stewart v R was relevantly comparable with the present case.
	
	
	There are to be found many other cases where sentences for offences against s 61I have been imposed of greater severity than that which Rothman J would substitute in the present case. Some of them are cited in the reasons of the Court in the appeals referred to above. Without rehearsing the facts and points of difference in such other cases it may be said of them generally that they involve either objective or subjective features which would explain the more severe punishment. By making this comparison with cases which were significantly less serious than the present case overall, with others which are most closely comparable and with those which clearly warranted more severe punishment than the present applicant, the Court can be satisfied that the sentence proposed by Rothman J is relevantly consistent with its other decisions in sentence appeals concerning s 61I offences.
	
	
	For the reasons given by Rothman J and for the additional reasons which I have given above, I agree that the orders of the Court should be as his Honour proposes.

2701366,Baines v R [2016] NSWCCA 132,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: Section 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) makes it an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment to assault a person, committing an act of indecency in the course of the assault. The applicant was convicted on 27 November 2014, following a trial by jury in the District Court, of 11 offences of indecent assault involving seven different women. Thereafter, he entered pleas of guilty to two further counts on a separate indictment.
	
	
	Each of the assaults took place in the course of him providing professional services as a masseur at a gymnasium. The applicant was sentenced on 9 April 2015 to an aggregate sentence of five years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offending and the reasoning of the sentencing judge have been set out in some detail by Fagan J and need not be repeated. There is a sufficient reason to be troubled by aspects of the sentencing, including the findings as to indicative sentences on each count, to warrant a grant of leave to appeal against the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	I agree with Fagan J that the first two grounds of appeal should be rejected. I add the following reasons with respect to those matters. Ground 3 (manifest excess) requires further consideration.
	


Ground 1 – uncharged acts


	
	The first ground of appeal alleged that the sentencing judge had taken into account “uncharged acts” as a factor increasing the objective seriousness of the offences. That was simply not so: what the judge said was that the applicant had embarked on a course of conduct, by reference to the 13 offences which were before her for sentence, involving conduct extending over some four years. It would, of course, be wrong in sentencing an offender for a specific offence to increase the penalty on account of other misconduct, whether separately charged or not. However, it is not an error to assess the seriousness of the specific offence by reference to surrounding circumstances, including other offending which is established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	There is a sense in which it is possible to characterise that use of other misconduct as denying leniency for an isolated instance of offending. However, it is not correct to say, as the applicant submitted, that other offending “cannot be taken into account on sentence unless the offender admits them or in order to rebut the offender’s submission that the offence was an isolated incident”. Nor are the statements of Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [1]  inconsistent with that proposition. The contrary suggestion depends on reading a statement in the judgment out of context. Thus, at [55], Spigelman CJ stated:
	


“The effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that, absent an admission, the Court should not take into account commission of other offences when sentencing for particular offences charged. The position is otherwise, it appears, in the case of an admission.”


	
	To suggest that this proposition is inconsistent with taking into account matters proved beyond reasonable doubt at a trial involves reading a statement made in a particular factual context as if it contained a general principle applicable in other contexts when, as a matter of principle, that could not be right.
	


Ground 2 – charges capable of summary disposition


	
	The second ground of appeal asserted that the Court failed to take into account the fact that the offences were capable of summary disposition.
	
	
	There are numerous cases in this Court accepting that such a matter may be a factor to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence. In R v Doan, [2]  Grove J noted that the prosecution had submitted that “these cases do not expose any reasoning underlying a principle that the availability of summary jurisdiction and lower ceiling of penalty should be a matter of mitigation.” [3]  Grove J accepted that the cases reveal that the circumstance “can, rather than should, be a matter of mitigation.” He continued:
	


“All offenders in the relevant situation would have lost the chance of being dealt with within the restrictions applicable in the summary court and for that reason that chance should not be ignored. The significance of the loss of that chance would undoubtedly vary from case to case and in some cases it would contribute to mitigation, in others, not.”


	
	How it contributes to mitigation is by no means clear. It may be assumed that the principle only operates in circumstances where it is the prosecutor who has elected to have the matter dealt with upon indictment, pursuant to s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Thus, one may assume that the Director of Public Prosecutions has determined that the magistrate may not have sufficient sentencing options available and that the matter should, therefore, be dealt with in a higher court. No doubt the result of that election is to expose the offender to potentially more serous penalties. If, after hearing all the evidence (whether at trial or on a plea) the sentencing judge takes a different view, no doubt he or she will impose a penalty which might have been available in the Local Court. The question is whether, and if so why, the offender should then be entitled to a lower penalty than would otherwise have been appropriate. The best that can be said is that the offender has been exposed to a form of punishment by way of facing a potentially higher sentence. Whether that factor can significantly affect the sentence is by no means clear. Unless it could have a significant effect, the failure to consider it should not warrant a grant of leave to appeal.
	
	
	The applicant noted a passage in Bonwick v R, [4]  adopting a principle set out by Hall J in R v Palmer, [5]  to the following effect: [6] 
	


“In my opinion, the principle to be derived from Palmer is a rule of law that is to be taken into account. It will have a greater influence in the sentencing as both the objective criminality falls below the mid-range, and as the subjective criminality of the offender assumes more significance: Crombie at [16].” [7] 


	
	It is doubtful whether there is “a rule of law”; if there is, it should be applied, not “taken into account”. However, what was meant was that there is a factor to be taken into account with varying significance in different contexts. Again, the particular nature of the significance is not articulated, except to suggest that it concerns the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	To approach the matter on the basis of a presumptive fetter on the exercise of the court’s sentencing discretion implies a power to review the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the selection of jurisdiction. As noted in the joint reasons in Magaming v The Queen, [8]  “[i]t is well established that it is for the prosecuting authorities, not the courts, to decide who is to be prosecuted and for what offences.” To which one might add, and in what court. The court should impose the appropriate sentence for the offence as proved, within the limits of the sentencing court’s jurisdiction and discretion.
	


Ground 3 – manifest excess


	
	A finding that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive must turn on three broad factors, namely that:
	



	
	the absence of physical or emotional coercion, suggesting some degree of ambivalence on the part of the victims, was inconsistent with a finding of objective seriousness above the middle of the range for such offending, and
	
	
	an assessment of the victim impact statements did not demonstrate clear and immediate adverse effects on the complainants; and
	
	
	the indicative sentences for each offence (basically two year fixed terms) were excessive, indicating error in the final sentence.
	



	
	With respect to the first point, the difficulties inherent in intervening with respect to the assessment of objective seriousness of the offending are well understood. As explained by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v Regina [9]  the Court is (and should be) slow to set aside such a finding, given the evaluative nature of the exercise and the need to assess a range of factors which may be susceptible of significantly differing views. Those difficulties are at their height in circumstances where there has been a trial in which the sentencing judge has been able to assess the evidence of the complainants and the offender in the witness box. Nor are those difficulties diminished where, as in the present case, this Court has not even had the benefit of the transcript of the trial, although the benefit of a transcript may be quite limited.
	
	
	It is not possible to identify any specific error in the careful judgment given by the sentencing judge. The challenge is to the evaluative judgments involved therein. Detailed written submissions were presented for the offender in the sentencing proceedings. They were thorough, extending to 80 pages. They included extracts from the cross-examination of the complainants. To a significant extent, they sought to excuse as trivial or inconsequential, the offences for which the offender had been convicted. For example, it was said that certain objective features were common to all offences and all complainants, namely: [10] 
	


“The complainant did not convey, indicate, display or show signs of any form of disapproval or non-consent during or immediately after the massage:

(1)   No words were spoken indicating disapproval or non-consent.

(2)   No bodily actions were performed indicating disapproval or non-consent.

(3)   No concerns were raised.

(4)   No objections were raised.

(5)   No complaints were made.”


	
	More examples of conduct which did not take place were set out in subsequent paragraphs. With respect to the offender, 12 possible aggravating features were identified, which were absent.
	
	
	With respect to the second point, the three victim impact statements had to be viewed in the context of the evidence of the complainants. It appears that the evidence of the complainants (of which this Court has only glimpses) supported the victim impact statements in demonstrating that, despite being mature women, the complainants were significantly affected by the conduct, were confused and uncertain as to what had been done to them and had experienced significant adverse psychological consequences.
	
	
	Further, it was not in doubt that what happened was an abuse of a professional relationship in which the offender persuaded each of the complainants either to take off her clothes, including underwear, or to let him take them off. The sentencing judge said: [11] 
	


“In relation to all of the offences I find that the offender committed the offences for his own sexual gratification. This is the only finding I can make, given the jury’s verdicts. I find that he did have the tendency attributed to him by the Crown, namely the tendency to touch the breasts and genitals of his female patients. I am not, however, sentencing him for having such a tendency. I am sentencing for each of the offences.”


	
	She described the offences as involving an abuse of trust. She also described the three victim impact statements as each,
	


“a powerful expression of how the offences have affected these particular victims. The victims describe feeling that what the offender did was their own fault, feeling violated, humiliated, feeling embarrassed and feeling a sense of fear that they would not be believed. … What comes out strongly in the victim impact statements is the deep loss of trust that each woman suffered at having been taken advantage of by the offender.” [12] 


	
	The trial judge also concluded that the offender had “little insight into the significance of his breach of trust and the consequences of it upon the victims.” [13]  Again, the finding was open to the judge and there is no basis for this Court to interfere with it.
	
	
	Turning to the third point (the indicative sentences), there was a degree of arbitrariness in the sentences proposed by the sentencing judge. Those sentences were not imposed (the actual sentence was an aggregate sentence) and an appeal does not lie against those indications. Their relevance is that they may suggest error in the assessment of the aggregate sentence.
	
	
	A matter apparent from the indicative sentences is the weight placed upon the fact that these offences were not isolated, but constituted a course of conduct. The fact that there was a course of conduct was significant in two respects. First, it limited the degree of leniency which might have been accorded in respect of individual acts. Secondly, it demonstrated a significant element of premeditation and planning. Each of these factors will warrant a more serious penalty than would otherwise have been imposed; nevertheless, that fact should not overwhelm the need to take account of the likely effects of the conduct on the individual victims, so as to identify an appropriate sentence for each offence.
	
	
	However, the care with which the sentencing judge addressed each separate offence does not demonstrate error in this regard. The conclusions of the sentencing judge with respect to objective severity were expressed in the following terms: [14] 
	


“When it comes to indecent assaults upon adults, objective gravity is informed obviously by, the nature of the touching, where on the body the touching took place, the duration of it and the surrounding circumstances. I find that the offences are not in the lowest range, but fall into the middle of the range of seriousness. All of the touching took place directly onto the breast and not through clothing or other drapery and, as I have already stated, I do not accept that any offence was fleeting or momentary. Significantly, each offence occurred as part of a course of conduct that extended over a number of years.

I have outlined each of the acts that constitute each of the 11 offences. I will sentence the offender for each act taking into account the surrounding circumstances, because the surrounding circumstances do bear, in my view, upon the seriousness of the acts. I must be careful, however, not to infringe the principle in De Simoni, where such act gives rise to another offence, as it clearly does, in many respects, here. I take those other acts into consideration as establishing that none of the indecent acts were committed in isolation, and that applies both in relation to the whole of the course of conduct, that is, toward all the victims, but it also applies in relation to the course of conduct engaged in by the offender toward each particular victim.”


	
	The sentencing judge also placed what she described as “paramount importance” with respect to each offence on the fact that the offender abused his position of trust, which constituted an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Against these background circumstances and considerations, the challenge to the sentence as manifestly excessive depended on two contentions. The first was that the indicative sentences failed to distinguish satisfactorily between the circumstances of counts 1-11. The second reason was that, in relation to individual offences, the sentencing judge noted in several instances that there was more than one aspect of the massage which was alleged by the prosecution to be an act of indecency. In each case, the judge sentenced on the basis of a touching of the victim’s breast. The fact that there was other conduct which might have been taken into account but was not, taken together with the relatively short time involved in each assault of that kind, demonstrated, the applicant submitted, that the assessment of the middle range of objective gravity was unreasonable.
	
	
	These considerations do not, however, apply to the more serious offending dealt with on the second indictment. Sucking the victim’s nipples and masturbating her, again, on the finding of the judge, for his own sexual gratification, was, as the sentencing judge concluded, the most serious of the offences. It was also the most recent of the offending. The sentencing judge allowed a 10% discount for the late guilty plea, but indicated an individual sentence of two years and six months, involving a pre-discount starting point which was 55.5% of the maximum sentence.
	
	
	That offence alone would have warranted a non-parole period of 18 months, given the context in which it occurred. Even if only 12 months of that sentence were to be non-concurrent, the remaining 12 offences, accepting a degree of accumulation within them, carried a non-parole period of 24 months (giving a total of three years). To accumulate each sentence by a period of two months of mandatory custody suggests that the indicative sentences do not truly reflect the seriousness of each offence. That exercise, however, would not permit this Court to conclude that the aggregate non-parole period of three years imprisonment was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The strongest factors favouring the applicant were his prior good character and the fact that he had not previously been convicted of any offence, let alone one involving a sentence of imprisonment. These were factors which militated against a significant custodial sentence. On the other hand, they would have weighed more heavily in his favour had there been an isolated offence, rather than an extensive course of conduct.
	
	
	Forms of non-consensual sexual gratification are highly variable. Some are more intrusive than others, and some have graver consequences for their victims than others. However, the sentencing judge was not in error in concluding that each of the offences, taken in context, warranted a custodial sentence. To suggest that some did but others did not would be to draw invidious distinctions between the conduct with respect to particular complainants and the effect on those complainants in circumstances where this Court does not have before it the full material which was available to the sentencing judge. Such a course would run the risk of interference on a false basis.
	
	
	If the period of mandatory custody were not excessive, nor could the overall sentence be so described. If twelve months were to be notionally attributed solely to the most serious offence, the notional period attributable solely to each of the other offences would be four months.
	
	
	Although the indicative sentences may not be supportable, because there cannot be an appeal in respect of the indicative sentences, it is not necessary to indicate what sentences this Court would have considered appropriate. The application for leave should be granted, but the appeal must be dismissed.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment of Fagan J and the orders that his Honour proposes. I generally agree with the analysis of the comparable sentences and judgments that his Honour has set out in his reasons.
	
	
	I agree with the analysis of grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal and that they must fail. Ground 2 requires some further comment.
	
	
	A charge that may be dealt with summarily in the Local Court and also on indictment is either brought appropriately in the District Court or it is not. If the application of sentencing principles to achieve the purposes of sentencing result in the imposition of a sentence beyond the jurisdiction of the Local Court, then the matter is plainly appropriate for the District Court. It is unclear what regard should be had to the fact that a like offence, warranting a lesser sentence, could have been brought in the Local Court. I reiterate my comments in Stamford v R: [15] 
	


“[50] A court may have regard on sentence, in a matter dealt with by the court on indictment, to the fact that the matter could have been dealt with by way of summary disposal: R v Sandford (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 195. The obverse is also true; a court may choose, for good reason, not to have regard to that fact. In this instance the prosecuting authority chose to have the matter dealt with in the District Court. The exercise of that power was correct and cannot be the subject of criticism. So much is conceded by the applicant. The criminality of the offence in question was too serious to be dealt with by the Local Court. In those circumstances, the sentencing judge is required to deal with the matter in accordance with ordinary principle. The sentencing judge is required to have regard to any standard non-parole period, the maximum sentence that may be imposed and the general principles applicable either under the common law or statute to the fixing of the sentence. The jurisdictional limit for a sentence, if the matter were to have been processed in the Local Court, is not a constraining element (or any element) in those circumstances: R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [14]–[16]; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [29], [30]. This ground of appeal fails.” [16] 


	
	Statistics, if used as a limit on, or definition of, the range available for a sentence become a self-fulfilling limitation, unrelated to the guideposts of maximum sentence and any standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The reasons for judgment of Fagan J set out the summary of offences and the conduct giving rise to them, as a consequence of which it is unnecessary for a description of the offences or the conduct to be repeated. Thus, I can more briefly outline the basis upon which, with great respect, I disagree with his Honour’s proposed orders.
	
	
	First, to those unaware of the process, sentencing involves the somewhat counterintuitive process by which a sentencing judge is required to determine the relative seriousness of offending conduct. That comparative process of evaluation is a process that examines the range of conduct covered by the offence in question and measures the conduct in which an offender has engaged relative to the range of conduct that is involved in offences covered by the provision. Thus, one reserves the maximum sentence for that class of cases that involves conduct of the worst category covered by the criminal provision. Further, one measures the conduct before the Court for sentencing against the range between the worst category of conduct and that which is in the lowest category of conduct covered by the offence. In so doing, the Court is neither condoning the conduct nor excusing it.
	
	
	His Honour, Fagan J, has assessed the conduct of brushing across the nipple as one of the least serious offences covered by the provision under which the applicant was charged. With that proposition and analysis, I agree. I agree with that proposition because, compared to the prolonged massaging of the breast, while naked, or the touching or massaging of genitalia, it is far less serious. That does not mean that the offence is not a serious one; the legislature, in fixing the maximum sentence, has so prescribed and the courts consider it as one.
	
	
	There are two aspects on which comment is required. First, the fact that the victims voluntarily submitted themselves, naked, to the touch of the applicant requires comment. In my view, such a statement does not adequately represent the particular circumstances of these offences. Nor can it be, in the circumstances, an ameliorating factor.
	
	
	Each of the women was not “naked” in the sense to which that term was sought to be used to seek to ameliorate the seriousness of the conduct. Some of them had their clothing removed. All of them had a towel covering their body and giving them, what they would have reasonably thought, was a protection to their sense of modesty. The towel was removed for other than therapeutic reasons. It was not necessary or appropriate from a professional standpoint.
	
	
	Secondly, the seriousness of the offence was sought to be addressed separately from the professional relationship. In my view the professional relationship between masseur and client is at the core of the offences in this case.
	
	
	If a person attends on a professional, whether or not the person needs to be naked for that attendance, there is no warrant for treating a sexual assault or act of indecency any less severely. The person, being the client, is entitled to have her or his problem addressed professionally and without being subject to indecent assault or an act of indecency. This aspect, namely the professional relationship between the applicant and the victims, renders the objective seriousness of the conduct far worse than it would have been, if there were no professional relationship between them.
	
	
	The next aspect of the assessment of the objective seriousness relates to the damage to the victims. In my view it is inappropriate to take account of the particular damage to one victim who had been the subject of sexual abuse earlier in her life. On the other hand, it is inappropriate to take account to any significant degree that many of the victims (but not all of them) returned for further massages. It must be said that the return of some of the victims for further massages is a disconcerting aspect of the charges preferred. However, in my view, it is inappropriate, in the absence of an appeal against conviction, to discuss the effect of such subsequent conduct, except to the extent that his Honour Fagan J has, in that it speaks more clearly as to the perceived damage and effect on the victims than most other evidence would.
	
	
	However, taking into account the particular damage to a particular victim has dangers. While the Court is required, if appropriate, to receive and consider a victim impact statement, such a statement should refer only to the effect on the victim of the offence with which the offender has been charged. [17]  More importantly, a sentencing judge should, in my opinion, take account of the effects of the offence on the victim only to the extent that it is a usual, probable or expected effect. [18] 
	
	
	In that regard, I would suggest that the long-lasting traumatic effect of unwanted sexual conduct, be it an act of indecency, indecent assault or worse, is a usual and expected result of the conduct. However, even though the courts are aware that sexual abuse on women is a far more common incident than has ever previously been thought, it is, unless there were knowledge on the part of the offender, inappropriate to take into account the effect due to a combination of the offence with which the offender is charged together with earlier abuse that may have been perpetrated by another.
	
	
	I turn then to the seriousness of the offences and the sentence that was imposed. There can be no appeal against the indicative sentences, whether excessive or lenient. The only appeal that is able to be lodged is against a sentence imposed. In the case of an aggregate sentence, it is the aggregate sentence that is the subject of appeal and not the indicative sentences that may lead to it.
	
	
	Nevertheless, if the indicative sentences are manifestly excessive (or inadequate) it may disclose the reason that an aggregate sentence is in such category (or more readily lead to such a conclusion).
	
	
	I do not agree with the categorisation that the brushing of the nipples was “an extension of degree” to the touching of a naked body. In my view, the non-therapeutic touching has a qualitative difference to therapeutic touching that is required or appropriate and to which the victims submitted. Further, I do not consider that, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, it was error to move directly from the nature of the touching to the number of offences that have been charged and the course of conduct over a significant period.
	
	
	Further, I accept that the offences with which the applicant was convicted vary in seriousness, in a way not reflected in the different indicative sentences. [19]  However, we are dealing with indicative sentences and the Court ought not to lose sight of the circumstances of sentencing for a number of similar offences that the judge has concluded will be reflected in an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Next, I do not share any disbelief in the proposition that a person may be unwillingly sexually aroused sufficiently to reach orgasm and, nevertheless, feel sufficiently intimidated, regardless of age, not to complain to the perpetrator about an unwanted, uninvited and unsolicited sexual contact.
	
	
	There is no reason to suggest that her Honour’s comment in sentencing the applicant that he had “little insight into the significance of his breach of trust and the consequence of it upon his victims” is incorrect. Most sexual assault or acts of indecency relate to the exercise of control and power, rather than sexual attraction. Nevertheless, there are no reported instances of massages of this kind being provided by the applicant to male clients.
	
	
	Ultimately, like Fagan J, I take the view that the sentencing judge’s indicative sentences are heavy, if considered individually and without regard to the number of offences and victims. However, I do not consider that the excessiveness of the indicative penalties reveals the excessiveness of the aggregate term.
	
	
	The maximum sentence that may be imposed for this offence, under s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900, is five years’ imprisonment. There are 13 such offences on eight different victims. Some of the offences are not a mere brushing of the nipple; the offences include the fondling and sucking of the nipple and the massaging of the clitoris and genital area. For the reasons that the brushing of the nipple may be, without more, the least serious touching, the other conduct is in a far more serious category.
	
	
	Given the conduct over an extended period, the number of offences and the number of victims, I do not consider that the aggregate sentence imposed is manifestly excessive, in that it does not, by the result, disclose an otherwise unidentifiable error of the kind that would allow intervention with a discretionary exercise such as sentencing.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	Since the drafting of the foregoing, I have had the advantage of reading the draft reasons of Basten JA. I agree with those reasons and the orders proposed in them.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his sentence for 13 counts of indecent assault contrary to s 61L Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Sentence was imposed by her Honour Judge Baly SC in the District Court following guilty verdicts returned by a jury in respect of 11 counts. Pleas of guilty were subsequently entered to two additional counts on a separate indictment.
	
	
	The offences occurred between 1 October 2008 and 31 March 2012 when the applicant was aged between 54 and 58 years. He worked part-time as a masseur at a gymnasium which operated at two separate locations during the charge period. There were 8 female complainants whose ages ranged from 33 to 57 years at the time of the offences against them respectively. All complainants were customers of the applicant whom he indecently assaulted while performing therapeutic massage. The extent of the indecent assaults for which he was sentenced was limited to touching the breasts in relation to all but one of the complainants. In respect of the eighth complainant the particulars on one count were that the applicant sucked one of her nipples and on a further count that he touched her genitals in a manner more fully described at [97].
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each offence is 5 years imprisonment. Her Honour imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years. The non-parole period commenced on 9 April 2015. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole from 8 April 2018. To the date of the hearing of his application for leave in this Court on 6 June 2016 he had served just short of 14 months of full-time custody.
	
	
	In connection with fixing the abovementioned aggregate sentence her Honour nominated indicative sentences on each of the first 11 counts of 2 years imprisonment. For the twelfth count (sucking the nipples of the eighth complainant) her Honour’s indicative sentence was 2 years (after allowing a 10% discount for the late plea of guilty, implying a starting point of over 2 years and 3 months). For the thirteenth count (touching the genitals of the eighth complainant) the indicative sentence was 2 years and 6 months (again with a 10% discount, implying a starting point of over 2 years and 9 months).
	


Objective facts of the offences


	
	In relation to several of the counts the Crown alleged and led evidence from the relevant complainant of multiple alternative acts of indecency. For example in relation to Count 1 the Crown alleged:
	


“First, the offender’s hand skimming the victim’s vagina, secondly, touching by the offender’s hands of the victim’s pubic area, or thirdly, touching the victim’s breast during the ‘toe to finger’ massage”. (RoS p 2)


	
	The jury’s verdict of course did not identify which of the alternatives they had found proved beyond reasonable doubt. They had to be unanimous as to at least one of the three (in the example of Count 1). This was similarly the position in relation to Counts 2, 3, 5 and 9 (two alternatives of touching relied upon for each count) and Count 6 (three alternatives).
	
	
	Her Honour decided to sentence on the basis that the indecent assault in each count where the Crown had put alternative particulars was constituted by touching the complainant’s breasts. In part this course was adopted because “[t]he Crown Prosecutor put to the jury that the strongest of these factual alternatives was the breast touching during the finger to toe massage” (RoS p 3). Her Honour found the alternative particulars of each such count proved beyond reasonable doubt but her descriptions of them in the Remarks on Sentence indicate that the alternatives involved either no contact or minimal and insubstantial contact. For example, “skimming the victim’s vagina”, “touching the victim’s pubic area”, “running of the hands over the vaginal area” and moving a complainant’s knee and leg in a manner to expose her vagina to the view of the applicant but without touching. Her Honour evidently considered the touching of breasts to be the most serious particular in cases where alternatives were also proved.
	
	
	The dates of the respective offences as pleaded in the indictment and as nominated by the complainants in their evidence were in most cases uncertain. For some counts the dates were specified only to the extent of having occurred within a range of, in some cases, a few months and in other cases longer, up to nearly 2 years. The time intervals nominated for charges and complainants overlapped. Uncertainty about the dates is no doubt attributable to long delay before complaint was made in relation to most of the instances.
	
	
	The relative seriousness of each count and of the course of offending overall is best appreciated by considering the counts in groups by complainant, in the sequence in which they are pleaded in the indictment. That is broadly the chronological order of relevant events. The appeal papers do not include the trial transcript. For some of the factual detail I have relied upon summaries and references to evidence appearing in written submissions on sentence which were provided to the learned sentencing judge.
	


Complainant A – Counts 1 and 2 (October ‘08 – June ‘09) and Count 3 (February ‘10 – December ‘11)


	
	Complainant A was aged about 40 years at that time of the first two counts and 41 or 42 at the time of the third. The relevant touching was the same in each of Counts 1, 2 and 3. The applicant performed a “toe to finger massage” which involved continuous movement of one finger over the complainant’s body without stopping or grabbing and without concentrating on any part of the body. This was done repeatedly during each toe to finger massage. In the course of this procedure the applicant traced one finger in a line along the outer side of the complainant’s breast.
	
	
	In the complainant’s evidence at trial she said the applicant “always spoke nicely”, was “polite”, “friendly”, “pleasant” and never “intimidatory”. Her Honour found:
	


“the touching of the breast was a like touching on each occasion, … it occurred at the end only of the massages, … it was not for a lengthy period of time, … it occupied part only of the total finger exercise, … there was no greater concentration on the breast than any other part of the body, and no prodding, squeezing, groping or massaging the breasts, … at all times the offender was polite pleasant and friendly and the victim did gain some health benefits from the offender’s massages.” (RoS p 7)


	
	After the event which is the subject of Count 1 Complainant A did not protest to the applicant or to the owner of the gymnasium (with whom she had frequent contact) concerning the manner in which she had been touched. She returned for further massages expecting that they would include the same actions as part of the toe to finger massage. Immediately after the massage which is the subject of Count 3 she joined the applicant for conversation over a cup of coffee at a nearby café. She returned on a subsequent occasion for another massage in which she was touched in a similar fashion, as she expected. This last instance was not charged.
	
	
	Her Honour found:
	


“As to the fact that [Complainant A] did not complain, and returned for massages … it is clear to me that she, as well as many of the other victims, felt that what the offender did was not right, however, she went back to see him again. For a number of reasons including; that she did not want to upset the offender or offend him, the fact that he was an otherwise pleasant person, the impact of what others said about him, which was positive, a certain mistrust of her own feeling that all was not right and the fact that he was effective in relieving the pain and was pleasant and friendly and not violent, and she felt that no one would believe her if she did complain. She went back on at least one occasion because she hoped that he would have improved. … [a]t this point … her reaction was brought about by the trust that she had in the offender. He gained her trust and then grossly abused that trust.” (RoS pp 5 – 6)


	
	Her Honour took into account a victim impact statement in which this complainant said that she had been sexually abused as a child. She did not give details of that earlier experience. Complainant A said in this statement she felt uneasy about the way she was massaged but “thought that I had done something wrong”. She did not tell her husband or anyone else because she was afraid and embarrassed and thought she would not be believed. Her Honour gave weight to this material as evidence of the degree of harm suffered by the complainant. The learned judge found this and the victim impact statements of two other complainants to be:
	


“a powerful expression of how the offences have affected these particular victims. The victims described feeling that what the offender did was their own fault, feeling violated, humiliated, feeling embarrassed and feeling a sense of fear that they would not be believed. Initial feelings of not being supported changed when each later learned that other women had experienced similar offending. What comes out strongly in the victim impact statements is the deep loss of trust that each woman suffered having been taken advantage of by the offender.” (RoS p 24)


	
	Her Honour dismissed the circumstance of Complainant A having returned to receive further massages as having no significance:
	


“It was put that the victim, having returned for further massage in light of her knowledge of what might take place, renders the offences somehow less serious. I do not accept that contention. Rather, in my view, it reflects a lack of confidence by the victim in accepting her own feelings that it was not right and that came about because the offender had gained her trust.” (RoS p 7)


	
	The complainant was a mature woman. The applicant was not in a position of authority, control or influence over her. The fact that she returned repeatedly was necessarily relevant to the seriousness of the offending. First, it demonstrated a limit to the degree of upset or distress which could be taken to have been caused by the indecent touching. Refraining from immediate complaint might well not have been a reliable indicator of limited mental reaction to such an incident. But voluntarily returning for further massages, in the absence of any evidence that continued submission to the applicant’s services was medically or otherwise necessary, was strongly indicative of the limited degree to which the complainant was upset by the indecent touching of her breasts. Secondly, the fact of no complaint having been made and of the complainant having returned for subsequent massages would have been a counter indication to the applicant of any distress that his touching had caused. The second and third counts could therefore not be viewed as exacerbated upon the basis of the applicant having perceived that his conduct was distressing to the complainant.
	
	
	Her Honour rejected the proposition that touching of the nature involved in Counts 1, 2 and 3 (and in Counts 4 to 11) was at the lowest level of seriousness for indecent assault (RoS p 19). Instead it was held that they fell “into the middle range of seriousness”.
	
	
	In this I consider that her Honour erred. Putting to one side for the moment the aggravating circumstances of the applicant having abused his position as a service provider and of these counts having been part of a large number of offences against several complainants over a long course of conduct, the physical acts of touching the breasts of Complainant A with one finger were at the lowest level of seriousness. Such contact was less intrusive and less overtly sexual and indecent than would be, for example the touching of the genitals. The touching was in each case superficial, without impact or physical pressure or hurt. It was not accompanied by force, threat of force or restraint.
	
	
	The “toe to finger massage” involved the complainant lying completely naked on a massage bed. When she first lay down she wore a G-string which the offender removed. It was not alleged that that occurred without consent. In this form of massage the offender ran his finger, with the undisputed consent of Complainant A, generally over almost the entirety of her body including over erogenous zones such as the buttocks and thighs. (The complainant also consented to more conventional massage in which her body was touched, generally, by way of rubbing or kneading).
	
	
	At RoS p 19 her Honour treated the fact that the “touching took place directly onto the breast and not through clothing or other drapery” as contributing to the objective seriousness of the offences. This consideration would be of greater significance in a case of an offender reaching under clothing, for example in an office or social setting or on public transport. Assessment of the seriousness of these three indecent assaults must take into account that Complainant A did consent to extensive touching of her body whilst lying unclothed on a massage bed. The offence was constituted by an extension of degree, from the permitted and consensual touching of the client’s thighs, buttocks, lower back, abdomen, waist, chest and neck to the unauthorised touching of the breasts.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted expert evidence to the effect that touching the breasts was never warranted on therapeutic grounds as part of the “toe to finger” style of massage. It is not apparent to me, in the absence from the appeal books of any evidence on the subject, what therapeutic value there may have been in any part of this procedure, including the stroking of the masseur’s finger over the other parts of the body referred to above, all of which would be to some degree sensitive with respect to sexual arousal. The toe to finger treatment does not appear to have involved any action which would stimulate blood flow, ease the working of joints or free muscle tension. The entire procedure, as described, seems to have been capable of doing no more than inducing a pleasant sensation in the skin.
	
	
	The non-consensual extension from touching the rest of the body, generally, to touching the breasts is significantly different from, for example, a medical practitioner indecently touching a female patient’s breasts during a purported examination of another part of the body for the limited medical purpose of investigating a particular complaint or symptom. The touching of the breasts in each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 took place in a context where otherwise general touching the body was expected and consented to for the purpose, apparently, of its sensory effect.
	


Complainant B – Count 4 (January ‘09 – December ‘09)


	
	Count 4 was of a single indecent assault against Complainant B committed during 2009. Complainant B was approximately 37 years old at the time. During the course of a massage, with the complainant lying naked on her back, the applicant “ran two fingers from her toes to her shoulders including over her breast and nipple” (RoS pp 7 – 8). This was another “toe to finger massage” of the type described in connection with Counts 1, 2 and 3. There was no victim impact statement from this complainant. She made no immediate complaint (RoS p 8). After the event she continued to attend the gymnasium regularly, participated in classes with the applicant, chatted to him “in a friendly way” and, three months after the incident referred to in Count 4, had another massage from him. She continued to see him for massages in February and March 2010, limited to the legs.
	
	
	Her Honour said with respect to this count:
	


“I do not accept the submission that the offence is at the lowest level of seriousness for an indecent assault. This was touching on the naked breast and nipple and I do not find that it was fleeting or momentary. None of the offences can be looked at in isolation as the defence would have me do. That would be artificial. It is true of course that I must sentence for each offence in accordance with the decision of Pearce, but I cannot ignore the fact that the offences are part of a course of conduct that occurred over a period of years. That is the approach I must take when I come to consider the overlap of the offending in terms of the application of totality and the question of accumulation.”(RoS p 9)


	
	I respectfully consider that her Honour erred in failing to recognise that in terms of physical contact the touching involved in this charge, as with that in Counts 1, 2, 3 and the other counts up to number 11, was very much at the lower end of the range of physical conduct which may infringe s 61L. That is for the same reasons as given at [68] – [79] in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 3.
	
	
	The persistent pattern of offending and the number of complainants certainly warranted a more serious characterisation of the applicant’s total criminality and the imposition of more severe individual and total penalties than would have been appropriate to one or two isolated occurrences. But at this point in her Honour’s judgment she did not acknowledge that the individual act of indecency was of itself relatively slight. In the passage quoted at [81] above the learned judge moved straight to the consideration of multiplicity of charges and the entire course of conduct without separate recognition of the countervailing and mitigating factor of relatively minimal physical intrusion. It was minimal in context, relative to the extensive touching of the complainant’s naked body to which she consented.
	


Complainant C – Counts 5, 6, 7 (July ‘09 – December ‘09; 15 February ‘10; 13 August ‘11)


	
	Complainant C was aged between 43 and 45 years at the time of the offences concerning her. Each of Counts 5 and 6 involved the applicant running his finger across her breasts a number of times, including across or very close to her nipples. Count 7 concerned him putting oil across her breasts using one finger. Again this non-consensual touching was part of a “toe to finger massage” administered whilst the complainant was completely naked. There was no issue that extensive touching of the body, including many sensitive areas, was by consent.
	
	
	Complainant C found the applicant at all times polite pleasant and friendly. She considered that she had a friendship with him which continued throughout the period in which the offending massages were given. She had an additional massage in between that which gave rise to Count 6 and that with which Count 7 is concerned. She had two further massages after the one particularised in Count 7.
	
	
	As with Complainant A in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 3, her Honour expressly did not accept that this complainant’s repeated attendances upon the applicant, her continued friendship with him and the absence of complaint to him or to anyone else about him, at the time, in any way lessened the seriousness of the offending (RoS p 13). However those matters had the same significance for Complainant C as did similar circumstances with respect to Complainant A: see [73].
	
	
	The learned judge found that the touching of Complainant C’s breasts “was not fleeting” and rejected the submission that it was at the lowest end of the scale of seriousness for breaches of s 61L. I consider that her Honour was in error in this, confining consideration of relative seriousness for the moment to an analysis of the purely physical acts. These counts were of minimal objective seriousness, in isolation, for the reasons I have given above in relation to Counts 1 to 4.
	


Complainant D – Count 8 (January ‘10 – March ‘10)


	
	Complainant D was aged 57 years. Count 8 was constituted by the applicant massaging her breasts and nipples with the flats of his hands in a circular motion. She also made no complaint at the time and returned for further massages. Her Honour found this “irrelevant when it comes to the sentencing exercise”. I consider that to have been an erroneous exclusion from consideration of a matter which was relevant to determining the degree of upset caused to this complainant, for reasons similar to those given in relation to the other complainants considered above.
	
	
	Complainant D did not submit to being massaged fully naked. She had a towel over her upper body. While she was lying on her back it covered her from her chest to below the waist. The offender performed a massage for sciatic and hip pain. This included leg stretching. He then volunteered a “relaxation massage” in which the complainant reluctantly acquiesced. During this latter procedure he moved his hands under the towel and massaged her breasts using oil. This was a more serious act of indecency than the finger touching of Counts 1 to 7. It was more prolonged, it involved enduring contact and it was entirely different in character from any form of touching to which the complainant had consented as part of the overall massage she was receiving.
	


Complainant E – Count 9 (23 March ‘10)


	
	Complainant E was 34 years old when she received a “zone therapy” massage from the applicant. As described by her Honour at RoS p 15 this appears to have been the same as the toe to finger therapy: “he stroked the victim’s toes to her shoulder and he went over her breasts getting closer to her nipple each time”. The complainant was naked apart from her underpants during this “zone therapy”. Whilst recognising that there was no squeezing, prodding, groping or any form of verbal pressure or verbal or physical intimidation accompanying the improper contact, her Honour found that “the touching of the breast in the circumstances here is not of low seriousness”. As with the other counts already considered, that was in my opinion an erroneous assessment. This complainant did not return for any subsequent massage.
	


Complainant F – Count 10 (January ‘11 – March ‘11))


	
	Complainant F, aged 33 years at the time, received a “toe to finger massage” from the applicant within the first three months of 2011. She wore only a G-string during the procedure. In the course of the massage the applicant touched her breasts, five times on each side. He “went closer and closer to her nipple each time. He did not touch her nipple, but was very, very close to it” (RoS p 16). This complainant also acknowledged the politeness of the applicant at all times. Again her Honour did not accept “that the offence falls into the lowest end of any scale of seriousness” but in my opinion she should have done. The complainant described to the gymnasium manager, about one week later, what had occurred.
	


Complainant G – Count 11 (15 September ‘11)


	
	Complainant G was aged 36 years when she had a “deep relaxation” massage in September 2011, during which “the sides of her breasts were stroked … [and] the last stroke went over her nipple”. There was, as with all counts, a finding that this was not in “the lowest end of any scale of seriousness”. Complainant G’s victim impact statement was one of the three referred to at [16]. She recounted that she had not returned to the applicant after the incident but she did not talk to anybody, including her husband, about it.
	
	
	The victim impact statement is primarily concerned with the apprehension and anxiety that Complainant G has felt in relation to giving evidence. It does not record any significant mental upset directly from the experience of the minor indecent contact (as I would characterise it) at the hands of the applicant. Complainant G only acknowledged to any other person that she had experienced this indecent act when her closest girlfriend inquired why she had never returned to the applicant. When the complainant referred indirectly to the indecent assault upon her, the girlfriend stated that she knew of others who had had similar experiences and that she intended to report the matter to police. So far as the victim impact statement shows, that was the beginning of any emotional distress that Complainant G has felt about the matter.
	
	
	This statement could not support the finding made by her Honour as quoted at [16], yet that finding is expressed generally with respect to all three victim impact statements received. Her Honour misapprehended the gravamen of Complainant G’s impact statement.
	


Complainant H – Count 12 (February ‘12)


	
	Complainant H was 50 years old when she attended the applicant for a massage of her legs in February 2012. She had received 30 or 40 massages from him over previous years, from about 2008. The complainant and the applicant were friends. They had some social contact away from the gymnasium. As this massage was intended by the complainant to be only to her legs, she initially kept her bra and underpants on. However the offender asked her to remove them.
	
	
	After massaging the complainant’s legs whilst she was face down on the bed, the applicant asked her to turn over. He then performed toe to finger stroking of her body, as earlier described in relation to other counts. This included stroking over the naked breast. The complainant had experienced this before and apparently consented to it on this occasion. It is not the subject of a charge. The particular of Count 12 (as I shall refer to it, being the first count on the second indictment) is that the applicant sucked both the complainant’s nipples at the conclusion of the toe to finger stroking. This was a significantly more serious act of indecency than the light touching which has been referred to in the earlier counts (other than 8). However the description of events which immediately followed indicates that it did not cause the complainant significant affront or upset.
	
	
	The particulars of Count 13 (numbered 2(b) on the second indictment) are recounted by her Honour at RoS pp 21 – 22 as follows:
	


“… he moved his hand down to her pubic region and began massaging her genital area in a circular fashion. He rubbed the tip of her clitoris. … [Complainant H] did not expect this and she did not want it. However, she was unable to say or do anything to stop it. She felt a sensation of sexual climax approaching and mentally was trying to stop it, but she felt frozen, physically. The offender pinched her nose which stopped her from breathing, and then [Complainant H] climaxed.”


	
	No issue was raised, either at first instance or in this Court, as to whether it is credible that Complainant H, a mature, sexually experienced married woman, was able to be sufficiently sexually aroused to reach orgasm by being masturbated against her will, unrestrained and whilst wishing to arrest the progress of the sexual pleasure which the applicant’s actions were producing. The complainant was not tested in cross-examination about this account because the applicant pleaded guilty to the charge and thereby admitted the described event as factual.
	
	
	In view of the applicant’s plea and non contest regarding the circumstances of Count 13 his sentence for it has to be considered taking the above description of the incident at face value. The relative seriousness of any indecent physical touching must be evaluated with due regard to the effect of it upon the complainant. According to her Honour’s description the physical touching of Count 13 did not cause injury, pain or psychological hurt but, in the words of the RoS, “climax” – immediately following which the complainant sat up on the massage bed and discussed with the applicant that she had not previously been sexually stimulated in that manner by anyone except her husband. She then paid the applicant for the massage and went with him to have a cup of coffee and some conversation in a nearby cafe. The complainant and her husband spent a social evening with the applicant and his wife within a week or two afterwards.
	
	
	Complainant H’s victim impact statement speaks of persistent intrusive thoughts about “the sexual assault”, on the face of it referring to the particulars of both Counts 12 and 13. It also refers to “unwanted experiences from my childhood (experiences with a grandfather)” which are not elaborated. The statement says that reflection upon the events of these two counts “makes me feel sick, what a fool, an idiot, naive and stupid, to be coerced and placed in that situation”. It refers to the applicant as “someone I trusted [who] has taken advantage of me and sexually assaulted me”. The statement goes on to describe marital tensions caused by revelation of these events, stress concerning the expectation of having to give evidence and loss of friendships at the gymnasium.
	
	
	From this victim impact statement it is difficult to identify evidence of unpleasant thoughts or memories which the complainant may claim to have had of the event itself (which might be regarded as psychological sequelae) and to disentangle these from regret and embarrassment which would understandably have been caused by revelation of the events to her husband and, perhaps, to a wider circle of acquaintances. Her Honour did not recognise this mixed character of the victim impact statement of Complainant H: see the passage of the Remarks on Sentence quoted at [71].
	


Subjective circumstances of the applicant


	
	Her Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s subjective circumstances appear at RoS pp 24 – 27. He was aged 60 when he was sentenced. He was raised in a stable and caring environment and had positive relationships with both of his parents, now deceased, and with one older sister who died during his trial. Her Honour recognised that he was still grieving for the loss of his sister at the date on which she passed sentence. He had been married for 38 years up to that date. His marriage has been a happy one producing three children now adults. The applicant has three grandchildren.
	
	
	The applicant’s wife and family remained supportive of him when he was before her Honour for sentence. They spoke of him as a good man involved in community activities and charities. It was established to her Honour’s satisfaction that he was well regarded in the community, respected and trusted amongst his peers. Written references were provided to the learned sentencing judge describing him as, amongst other things, “an upright, honest and reliable citizen and a person of great integrity”.
	
	
	The applicant had worked for Telecom for most of his adult years. In 2009 he was semi-retired and, having obtained diplomas in massage therapy and in anatomy and physiology, he commenced to work part time as a masseur. He had been casually employed in that capacity at the time of the offences but had ceased practice by the date of sentence.
	
	
	Reports tendered to her Honour showed that the applicant took full responsibility for the offences and that he was “saddened by the impact that his actions have had on the victims”. However he denied that he sought or obtained sexual gratification from the commission of the offences. Her Honour rejected this and made a finding that he appeared “to have little insight into the significance of his breach of trust and the consequences of it upon victims”. Notwithstanding the reported expressions of his regret her Honour said that whilst she considered his prospects of rehabilitation were good this view was “not based upon any remorse or regret or insight demonstrated by the offender, because there has been none”.
	


Her Honour’s sentence decision


	
	Her Honour took account of the number of offences and the period of years over which they were committed. She rightly held that the sentence for each had to take into account that every one was part of a whole course of conduct. The number of complainants was correctly regarded as calling for some degree of accumulation. The offences were treated by her Honour as aggravated by the circumstance of having been committed in breach of a position of trust. With respect it was valid to take account of that circumstance. However given the nature of the procedure which the applicant was carrying out with the consent of each complainant, apparently primarily for pleasant stimulation of skin sensations over the naked body (see [78] and [79]), the abuse of trust was of a different order from that which would be involved in, for example, a doctor inappropriately touching a part of a patient’s body completely unrelated to any relevant medical examination.
	
	
	Although it is the aggregate sentence which is to be considered under appeal ground 3 (“The sentence imposed was, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive”), her Honour’s indicative penalties reveal the excessiveness of the aggregate term which she derived. Two years full-time imprisonment for each instance of touching a woman’s breasts in the circumstances of Counts 1 – 11 is in my opinion manifestly grossly excessive. Counts 1 – 7 and 9 – 11 were very low on the scale of seriousness, upon the purely objective considerations of the nature and circumstances of physical contact and the lack of significant harm caused. Count 8 was more serious than the others but still low in the range. Counts 12 and 13 involved more significantly indecent conduct than Counts 1 – 7 and 9 – 11 but the lack of distress, intrusion or hurt apparently felt by the complainant is offsetting to the degree of seriousness.
	
	
	The aggravating features of breach of trust and of repetition in a prolonged course of conduct are not capable of elevating each count to a level of criminality which would warrant a term of two years full-time imprisonment in each case, as indicated by her Honour. Nor were those features capable of aggravating the whole series of minor, nonviolent, superficial acts of indecency into a combined episode of criminality which would justify 5 years of imprisonment with a 3 year non-parole period, for an offender with this man’s character and antecedents. This conclusion follows from the matters considered in the balance of these reasons.
	


Comparison with other sentences under s 61L


	
	The indecent assaults committed in the cases considered in the following paragraphs appear to have been more serious than any of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced (viewed individually), yet the penalties imposed were either markedly lower than the 2 years imprisonment per count (and more for Counts 12 and 13) indicated by her Honour or (in one case) were of a similar order for graver offending. In an endeavour to achieve consistency a point of commencement is to compare the facts of the individual charges in the present case with facts considered in other sentencing decisions, including subjective circumstances of the offenders respectively. It will be necessary thereafter to consider whether the applicant’s repetition of offences against several complainants over more than three years elevates the seriousness of his offending overall to the level where it would justify the sentence determined by her Honour.
	
	
	Whether the whole course of conduct could justify individual sentences of the order indicated by her Honour is an intermediate matter to be considered. The quantification of indicative sentences was a step in the reasoning which led to the aggregate sentence. In this case it was a step which reveals that the determination of the aggregate miscarried because her Honour made an exaggerated assessment of the seriousness of the individual instances and of the punishment appropriate to them respectively.
	
	
	In considering the other sentence decisions which I find comparable I bear in mind that caution must be exercised when having regard to a relatively small sample: Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53 at [98]. On the other hand, the wider the group of comparatives adopted the more they will tend to include cases with features markedly different from those of the present appeal. Whatever the difficulties of reviewing other decisions and of making allowance for inevitable differences between them and the instant case, the task must be undertaken. Principles stated in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 demand that the Court should strive for consistency. There is no way of achieving this other than by comparing the case before the Court with other decisions. Recourse to statistics provides no meaningful comparison capable of substantiating consistency. Statistics do not individualise the cases from which they are drawn, do not reveal the number and strength of points of similarity and do not permit recognition of or allowance for points of difference.
	
	
	In R v Qin; Qin v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 189 the female complainant was receiving a massage of her leg muscles from the offender, a male masseur, when he ran his finger over her anus (giving rise to the first count, of indecent assault) and then parted her labia with his finger and touched her clitoris (the second count, of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I). The complainant was immediately significantly upset and fled from the massage premises. After being found guilty at trial a 5 year bond under s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was imposed for the first count. On the second, which carried a 14 year maximum, a 10 month sentence of imprisonment was wholly suspended.
	
	
	The Crown’s appeal against inadequacy was dismissed. The sentencing judge had referred to the “minimal degree of physical interference involved” and concluded that the second count fell “almost at the extreme lowest level” of seriousness for a contravention of s 61I. This Court considered these findings were “within the ambit of the sound exercise of his Honour’s function”. The offender had against him an earlier finding of guilt of an offence of indecent assault dating from 2000. The first of the offences in R v Qin was in my opinion of a level of seriousness comparable with Counts 1 to 12 against the present applicant, taking each of them in isolation. The second count dealt with in R v Qin was more serious than Count 13 in the present case and was charged under a section with a higher maximum.
	
	
	In Salmond v R [2010] NSWCCA 141 the female complainant received a massage from the offender to relieve chronic backache, shoulder and neck pain, migraine and tension headaches. The offender was convicted (after two trials) of one count of indecent assault constituted by brushing his hand against her clitoris and one count of sexual assault contrary to s 61I. Particulars of the latter were that he spread the complainant’s thighs apart and pushed his finger in and out of her vagina a few times. The complainant pushed his hand away and told him to stop. She was shaken and distressed by the occurrence and made immediate complaint to a friend, before attending a police station to report the matter shortly afterwards.
	
	
	The offender was almost 50 years old and of otherwise good character. He was sentenced in the District Court to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years for the indecent assault. Neither the conviction nor the sentence for this offence was appealed. This Court dismissed an appeal against a concurrent sentence of 2 years non-parole period and a balance of term of 2½ years for the s 61I sexual assault.
	
	
	The indecent assault in Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 consisted of the offender sucking the nipples of the complainant during a massage. Two counts of sexual assault contrary to s 61I were also proved, one constituted by touching the clitoris and the other by digital penetration. The complainant had pushed the offender’s head and hand away when each of the assaults occurred. She met with a male friend shortly after the massage and “collapsed crying”, describing the sexual abuse as “really, really bad”. The male friend accompanied her to report the events to police the same day. The sentence imposed for the indecent assault contrary to s 61L was a fixed term of 6 months, concurrent with two sentences (also concurrent as between themselves) of 18 months non-parole period and 6 months balance of term for each of the two s 61I sexual assaults.
	
	
	This Court rejected the offender’s severity appeal, which was confined to the terms imposed for the s 61I counts. Reliance was placed upon the lower sentences which had been imposed in R v Qin for a comparable offence against that section. The Court was not asked to consider the appropriateness of the 6 month term for the indecent assault. Notably, the sentences passed for the two s 61I sexual assaults were less severe than the indicative sentences nominated by her Honour in the present case for each of Counts 1 – 11, of touching the complainants’ breasts in contravention of s 61L.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel drew to the Court’s attention some sentencing decisions concerning aggravated indecent assaults charged under s 61M. No assistance is gained by consideration of these citations because the factor of the victim being under 16 years where s 61M is charged precludes meaningful comparison. Some other cases cited on behalf of the applicant wherein only sexual assaults contrary to s 61L were proved are likewise not comparable.
	
	
	Consideration of sentencing decisions under s 61L for offences committed in settings other than that of a masseur abusing his position show that significantly more invasive, aggressive and violent assaults than any of those perpetrated by the applicant have attracted sentences lower than or similar to the 2 year fixed terms which her Honour indicated here. In Aktar v R [2015] NSWCCA 123 the offender was a 28 year old man with no prior convictions. He refused to leave the complainant’s home when asked. He picked her up from where she was sitting, laid her on a sofa, pinned her down with the weight of his body, kissed and licked her and touched her breasts – all against her physical resistance. When the complainant sought to free herself and run from him the offender carried her to a bedroom, placed himself on top of her on a bed and removed her upper clothing. He kissed and fondled her breasts. This was the subject of a s 61L charge taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	The first substantive s 61L count was charged on facts that the offender forced the victim’s hand onto his penis whilst she was on the bed and rubbed it against her exposed chest. When the complainant tried to get up the offender pushed her back and again kissed and licked her upper body. This gave rise to the second substantive count under s 61L.
	
	
	After allowing a 10% discount for pleas of guilty the sentencing judge imposed on non-parole period of 9 months with a balance of term of 12 months for the first count (taking into account the Form 1 offence). On the second count a 6 month non-parole period was ordered with a balance of term of 7 months. Commencement dates were fixed to make the non-parole periods fully cumulative. But for the 10% discount the sentences would have been 10 months with a balance of term of 13 months on the first count and 6½ months with a balance of term of 7½ on the second, giving an overall sentence of 1 year 4½ months non-parole period with a balance of term of 13 months.
	
	
	The offences in Aktar v R were aggravated by being committed in the complainant’s home. The offender had been asked to leave and he was repeatedly asked to stop during what became a protracted course of indecently and forcibly assaulting the complainant. Leave to appeal against severity of the sentences was refused.
	
	
	In Sharma v R [2010] NSWCCA 338 the offender was a bus driver. He picked up the complainant, who suffered moderate intellectual disability, as a passenger. After all other passengers had alighted along his route, the offender drove the complainant to a park, locked the doors of the bus and indecently assaulted her. One count was laid under s 61L and another also under that section was included on a Form 1. The particulars were that the offender put his hand under the complainant’s clothing and touched her breasts, masturbated in front of her, repeatedly put his hands inside her pants and touched her vagina, pulled her pants down and put his face against her vagina and kissed her there. All of this was done against the complainant’s protests and physical resistance.
	
	
	After allowing a 15% discount for a late plea a non-parole period of 2 years was imposed with a balance of term of 1 year and nearly 5 months. But for the discount the non-parole period would have been 2 years and 4 months and the balance of term would have been about 1 year and 8 months. The sentence was not disturbed on a severity appeal. The offender was otherwise of good character.
	
	
	I have considered Jalloh v R [2009] NSWCCA 295 wherein concurrent sentences of 12 months non-parole period and 18 months balance of term were imposed for two serious s 61L offences perpetrated against a vulnerable and defenceless complainant who was lapsing in and out of consciousness due to intoxication. The subjective circumstances of the offender were compelling although this was offset by the fact that his offences were committed whilst on bail and were against a highly vulnerable victim. The presence of these additional factors, not present in the applicant’s case now before the Court, renders the decision not suitable for comparison for consistency.
	
	
	Both Aktar v R and Sharma v R concerned very significantly more serious indecent assaults than any of those perpetrated by the applicant. In R v Qin, Salmond v R and Jiang v R the s 61L offences were more serious than those in the present case. The s 61I offences were very much more serious and, of course, charged under a section carrying a higher maximum penalty. The s 61L offence in Jiang v R concerned sucking the complainant’s nipples (as in Counts 8 and 12 against the applicant) but it was coupled with two much more serious offences committed at the same time and causing a degree of fright, distress and affront which did not arise from the conduct of the applicant here.
	


Application of principles to assessment of seriousness


	
	In Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1 Basten JA (with whom Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) said at [146]:
	


“… a course of unlawful conduct may well give rise to a number of possible charges. If the prosecution proceeds on one count only, it does not follow that the surrounding conduct cannot be taken into account in sentencing. The surrounding conduct cannot give rise to a more serious offence, but it can demonstrate the degree of seriousness with which the charged offence should be viewed.”

See also Lago v R [2015] NSWCCA 296 at [49].


	
	In R v J.R.D. [2007] NSWCCA 55 Howie J explained the significance of taking into account other charged offences as bearing upon the relative seriousness of any individual count, as follows:
	


“[29] … Clearly it may be a fact or circumstance relevant to the commission of a particular offence that, at or about the time when that offence was committed, the offender committed other offences. It would be relevant, for example, to a finding whether the particular offence was an isolated ‘fall from grace’ or whether it was merely an instance of a course of criminal conduct in which the offender was involved at the relevant time.

[30] So in sentencing the respondent for any one offence it was highly relevant that all of the offences and the matters on the Form 1 were committed in a period of about four months and that each offence represented a different aspect of the respondent’s overall criminality in that period.”


	
	That consideration has some bearing in this case although the multiple counts were all individually opportunistic and reflective of a tendency on the part of the applicant rather than any concerted criminal enterprise or system. A course of offending may also make it appropriate to impose higher penalties for offences later in time, where there appears a persistent repetition of the commission of like offences with a mounting and/or accelerating level of criminality: Regina v Swadling [2004] NSWCCA 421 at [61] – [68]; R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292 at [37]; Qing An v Regina at [75].
	
	
	In Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ made this statement:
	


“[37] Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.”


	
	Giving full weight to this principle I nevertheless conclude that her Honour erred in refusing to treat the applicant’s offences as at the very low end of the range of seriousness for breaches of s 61L. I reach this conclusion having also taken into account the number of offences, the number of complainants, the period of offending and the fact of the applicant having misused his position as a masseur. Making proper allowance for the aggravating factors of repetition and misuse of a position of trust, at the end of the analysis these offences were still a series of minor touchings.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal for which leave is sought is that the sentencing judge “erred in taking into account the Applicant’s uncharged acts as a factor which increased the objective seriousness of the offences”. This ground is not made out. Her Honour had regard to all of the alleged particulars of each indecent assault. In the event, she sentenced upon the basis of the touching of the complainants’ breasts. In so far as her Honour recited in the Remarks on Sentence other particulars of indecency and may have taken into account those which she found proved beyond reasonable doubt, these cannot properly be characterised as “uncharged acts”. They had been alleged by the Crown in the alternative and evidence of them had been led.
	
	
	Ground 2 is that her Honour erroneously omitted “to take into account the fact that the offences were capable of summary disposition”. I consider the circumstance that these charges could all have been dealt with in the Local Court was of no significance to the determination of appropriate sentences in this case. Criminal liability was in issue. It turned upon acceptance or otherwise of the evidence of several female complainants and to some extent upon assessment of the legitimate bounds of massage technique. It was within the discretionary judgment of the Director of Public Prosecutions to elect that these issues be tried by jury.
	
	
	Ground 3 is that the sentence imposed was “in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive”. That is the ground which I find sustained.
	
	
	Taking into account all of the principles and the objective and subjective factors bearing upon the case, I consider that an appropriate individual penalty for each of Counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 is, in each case, a bond under s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, to be of good behaviour for 3 years. These offences all occurred over a period of a little more than one year between late 2008 and February 2010.
	
	
	Count 8 occurred in early 2010 and was more serious in the nature of the physical contact. It warrants a sentence of imprisonment for 1 month. Counts 3, 7 and 9 – 13 occurred later, between early 2010 and early 2012. These seven counts were against six separate complainants. The applicant’s persistence in this type of offending through this latter period warrants penalties of 1 month’s imprisonment for Count 3 then for each of the remaining offences 2 months full-time custody for each count. The terms for Counts 12 and 13 in my view should properly be served concurrently to reflect that they were offences perpetrated on one occasion against one complainant. Otherwise the short terms of imprisonment for these latter offences should be wholly cumulative, giving rise to a total effective term of 12 months.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose that the orders of the Court should be:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Quash the sentences imposed by Baly DCJ on 9 April 2015.
	
	
	In lieu thereof Garry Baines is sentenced on the counts in the indictment dated 5 November 2015 as follows:
	



	
	In respect of Counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 the offender is to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for 3 years commencing 9 April 2015.
	
	
	On Count 8 a term of imprisonment of 1 month commencing 9 April 2015 and expiring 8 May 2015.
	
	
	On Count 3 a term of imprisonment of 1 month commencing 9 May 2015 and expiring 8 June 2015.
	
	
	On Count 7 a term of imprisonment of 2 months commencing 9 June 2015 and expiring 8 August 2015.

2701369,Chidiac v R (No 2) [2016] NSWCCA 120,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 15 February 1989 following a trial by jury Neil Chidiac (“the appellant”) was found guilty of a charge that between about 1 May 1984 and about 4 July 1985 he conspired with Michael Asfour, Samir Helais, Alfred Oti, Wilson Kwalu and divers other persons to import into Australia a traffickable quantity of heroin.
	
	
	As a result of an order pursuant to s 79(1)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) made by Beech-Jones J on 9 March 2015, Chidiac, Neil – Application pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 157, the appellant’s challenge to this conviction is now before this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The hearing of the appeal commenced on 28 October 2015 with Macfarlan JA presiding. An adjournment was granted to enable the appellant’s counsel to prepare cross-examination of a police officer whose affidavit was served belatedly. Upon resumption on 7 March 2016 Macfarlan JA was unavailable. Both parties consented to the appeal proceeding part-heard with the Chief Justice replacing Macfarlan JA.

Appeal history


	
	Following his conviction the appellant was on 24 February 1989 sentenced to 20 years imprisonment commencing on the day of his arrest, 31 March 1988, and expiring on 30 March 2008. A non-parole period of 14 years was fixed, expiring 30 March 2002.
	
	
	The appellant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against conviction and applied for leave to appeal his sentence. The appeal and leave application were dismissed: Regina v Chidiac (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), Gleeson CJ, Meagher JA and Loveday J, 15 December 1989, unrep). An application to the High Court for special leave to appeal was dismissed on 1 March 1991: Chidiac v The Queen [1991] HCA 4; (1991) 171 CLR 432.
	
	
	On 10 February 1997 the appellant was released on parole having served slightly less than 9 years imprisonment. The balance of his term has now expired. In 2012 he applied to the Supreme Court under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act for an inquiry into his conviction. Section 79(1)(b) of that Act empowers the Court to “refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912” if “it appears there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case”.
	
	
	The reasons of Beech-Jones J for having made the order for referral need not be considered in this judgment. We refer to the proceeding now before this Court as “the appeal” because s 79 requires it to be dealt with as if it were one notwithstanding that the appellant has already exhausted his right under the Criminal Appeal Act to appeal against his conviction in the District Court. The present appeal commenced with the filing by the appellant of grounds on 2 June 2015. The Court granted leave to file amended grounds on the last day of the hearing, 18 March 2016. The issues now for consideration are defined by the amended grounds, not by Beech-Jones J’s identification of matters which appeared to his Honour to raise “a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt” (s 79(2)).
	
	
	The appellant’s motivation in seeking review of his conviction is in part economic. Property of his, including real estate, was forfeited under proceeds of crime legislation on the basis of the conviction. He expects to recover compensation for that property if his conviction is quashed. We refer to this merely to explain the reasons for the review. It does not imply any criticism of the applicant in seeking to pursue it.
	


Grounds of appeal and nature of proceedings


	
	The grounds, as follows, are all concerned with evidence said to be new or fresh, except for ground 3A concerning the Crown’s failure to call a witness:
	


1.    One of the two principal Crown witnesses at the appellant's trial, Alfred Oti, has recanted his evidence and now exculpates the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant's guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt. His conviction ought to be quashed and a verdict of acquittal ought to be substituted.

2.    A witness, ""George"", who the Crown failed to call at trial, has now given evidence exculpating the appellant (which evidence is further corroborated by a former officer of the Australian Federal Police). Accordingly, the appellant's guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt. His conviction ought to be quashed and a verdict of acquittal ought to be substituted.

3A.    The witness “George”, who was not called at trial, was believed by the Australian Federal Police, at all material times after the arrest of the appellant and until the trial of the appellant, to be a reliable witness. The failure to call George of itself deprived the appellant of a fair chance of an acquittal, and further warranted of itself a finding that the appellant’s guilt was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the appellant’s conviction ought to be quashed and a verdict of acquittal ought to be substituted.

3.    Further evidence which is now available, which was not called at trial, either separate from or alternatively together with the evidence described above, namely:

a.    evidence of Mr Durak Dursun, which corroborates the evidence of Mr Oti exculpating the appellant;

b.    evidence of Mr Alan Taciak, in relation to the failure to call ""George"" at trial;

c.    evidence in relation to the use of a pager owned by the appellant in 1985; and

d.    evidence in relation to the reasons for the appellant's visit to the Solomon Islands in 1985,

consolidates the conclusion that the appellant's guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt. His conviction ought to be quashed and a verdict of acquittal ought to be substituted.


	
	This Court’s approach to an appeal which comes before it by referral under s 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act is governed by what four justices of the High Court said in Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125 at [9] – [13] concerning closely similar Western Australian legislation. In deciding such an appeal “the whole case” (as referred to in s 79(1)(b)) embraces “the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether ‘new’, ‘fresh’ or previously adduced, in the case against, and the case for the appellant”. “New” evidence, as understood in relation to conventional appeals, is that which was available at the time of the trial and which could, by the exercise of reasonable diligence of the appellant and his advisers, have been adduced in the trial. In accordance with Mallard v The Queen “new” evidence in this sense is freely to be taken into consideration by the appellate court in deciding whether the verdict is to be set aside. Such evidence is not to be disregarded upon the basis that its omission earlier was not productive of unfairness in the trial.
	
	
	The High Court’s decision also requires that this Court should assess “the whole case” unconstrained by the way it was dealt with in the earlier conventional appeals. Their Honours said at [10]:
	


“That does not mean that the Court may not, if it think it useful, derive assistance from the way in which a previous appellate court has dealt with some, or all of the matters before it, but under no circumstances can it relieve it of its statutory duty to deal with the whole case. … The inhibitory purpose and effect of the words ‘as if it were an appeal’ are merely to confine the Court to the making of orders, and the following of procedures apposite to an appeal, and further, and perhaps most relevantly, to require the Court to consider whether the overall strength of the prosecution case requires the Court to apply the proviso contained in s 689(1) of the Criminal Code.”


	
	Section 86 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides:
	


“86 Reference to Court under section 77 (1) (b) or 79 (1) (b) following petition to Governor or application to Supreme Court

On receiving a reference under section 77 (1) (b) or 79 (1) (b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly.”


	
	As the present proceeding is, by force of ss 79 and 86 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, an appeal against conviction, the following words of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act apply:
	


“The court … shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, … or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, … provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.”


	
	It is important that in this appeal the only relief sought is the quashing of the appellant’s conviction and the substitution of a verdict of acquittal. For obvious reasons having regard to the passage of 19 years since the appellant completed his sentence he does not ask for an order for retrial. Grounds 1, 2 and 3, each of which turns upon evidence additional to that tendered at trial, necessarily depend upon the appellant bringing himself within that part of s 6(1) which speaks of a verdict that is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”. Ground 3A, which concerns the Crown’s failure to call witness, must satisfy a different part of s 6(1), namely, “that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice”.
	
	
	This Court’s approach to assessment of “the whole case” for the purpose of determining whether the verdict of guilty was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” must be the same in this appeal referred under s 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act as it would be in a conventional appeal brought directly under s 5(1) Criminal Appeal Act. That is, in accordance with the following passages from the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492 – 495:
	


“[6] Where a court of criminal appeal sets aside a verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, it frequently does so expressing its conclusion in terms of a verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory. … The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence (Morris v. The Queen [1987] HCA 50; (1987) 163 CLR 454) and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand’ (See Hayes v. The Queen (1973) 47 ALJR 603 at 604). …

[7] Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (See Whitehorn v. The Queen (1983) 152 CLR at 686; Chamberlain v. The Queen (No.2) (1984) 153 CLR at 532; Knight v. The Queen [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 504-505, 511). But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations (Chamberlain v. The Queen [No.2] (1984) 153CLR at 621).

[8] [Their Honours considered the judgment of Barwick CJ in Ratten v. The Queen (1974) 131 CLR at 516) and qualifications thereto expressed in Whitehorn v. The Queen and Chamberlain v. The Queen [No.2]] … [A]ccount must be taken of the advantage which a jury has in seeing and hearing the witnesses. To ask only whether the court has a doubt may place insufficient emphasis upon the fact the jury, having seen and heard the evidence given, was in a position to evaluate that evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.

[9] … In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence (Chamberlain v. The Queen (No.2) (1984) 153 CLR at 618-619; Chidiac v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443-444). In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (Chidiac v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR at 443, 451, 458, 461-462).”


	
	In order to apply these principles to grounds 1, 2 and 3 it is necessary to identify the evidence in the trial so far as it is relevant to the grounds raised, identify the additional evidence which has been tendered in the appeal, determine the admissibility (where challenged) of the additional evidence and then, upon all of the received material, reach a conclusion as to whether it has been shown that the jury, if it had had all of the admissible evidence including that which has now been received in this Court, must have felt a reasonable doubt – and if so, quash the conviction. On ground 3A this Court must determine whether any miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Crown not having called George.
	


Outline of the Crown case at trial in 1989


	
	The two principal Crown witnesses at the appellant’s trial were Alfred Oti (“Oti”), a senior officer in the Solomon Islands Customs Service, and Wilson Kwalu (“Kwalu”), a relative of Oti’s wife. Both were alleged to have been co-conspirators of the appellant and both gave evidence under indemnity from prosecution.
	
	
	Oti said that in 1979 or 1980 he and Kwalu met in Honiara a person who was referred to throughout the trial only by the name “George”. This was pursuant to an order for suppression of George’s full identity, made by the trial judge on application of the Australian Federal Police (“AFP”). George was not called by either party, in circumstances to be referred to hereafter.
	
	
	The evidence of Oti and Kwalu was to the effect summarised in the judgment of Dawson J in Chidiac v The Queen [1991] HCA 4; (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 448 – 449, as follows:
	


“[2] [In Honiara in 1979 or 1980] George sought assistance in locating two missing suitcases which he eventually said contained hashish. George then made arrangements with Oti and Kwalu to post drugs from Malaysia to Honiara concealed behind framed pictures. The drugs were to be collected by Oti and Kwalu and sent on to Sydney.

[3] Nothing further happened until 1984 when George contacted Oti by letter and by telephone. George said that there would be a parcel of drugs sent towards the end of the year. Oti was to collect it and to tell George when it arrived. It was then to be sent on to George. Oti informed Kwalu of the development and George kept in contact with Oti by telephone from Sydney. At about this time Oti was introduced by George to the applicant Asfour on the telephone and Asfour also spoke to Oti about drugs. Oti gave George the fictitious names of Tahai and Moli to use as addressees on the parcel.

[4] A parcel arrived in Honiara late in October 1984. It was postmarked Penang, Malaysia, and was addressed to either Tahai or Moli at a post box number. It contained framed pictures in the back of which were plastic packages of pink powder resembling icing sugar in texture. In total they weighed 800 to 1000 grams.

[5] Oti telephoned George in Sydney and arrangements were made for Kwalu to bring the packages to Sydney and for George to pay his expenses. Kwalu carried the packages, taped to his legs, by air to Brisbane on 29 November 1984. There he was met by George and Asfour. All three travelled by bus to Sydney, the packages having been transferred to a briefcase carried by George or Asfour. Kwalu returned to Honiara from Brisbane by air on 6 December 1984. Oti later paid Kwalu $1,000 with funds sent from Sydney.

[6] During December 1984 George again contacted Oti. He said that more of the same ‘stuff’ would come in January or February in a manner similar to that of the first parcel. The parcel arrived and Oti told George of the fact. Oti, at George's suggestion, told Asfour by telephone that the drugs had not yet arrived. Money was sent to Honiara and in February 1985 Oti flew to Sydney with the packages contained in the parcel. He delivered them to George and a man introduced to him as George's brother, Sam. Oti returned to Honiara. Asfour telephoned Oti, expressing anger at being deceived about the last parcel. Asfour said that he would send someone to see Oti in Honiara.

[7] Early in May 1985, George telephoned Oti and told him that he would be sending someone named Sam to discuss the redirection of further packages. In mid-May George told Oti that it would not be Sam but someone named Neil. Neil is the first name of the applicant Chidiac. On 27 May 1985, Chidiac arrived in Honiara with his family and telephoned Oti. Oti met Chidiac at the Mendana Hotel where Chidiac was staying. Chidiac referred to George, the previous parcels, the dangers involved, and other ways in which drugs could be brought to Honiara and smuggled into Sydney. The next day Oti again met Chidiac, this time with Kwalu. There was further discussion of drug smuggling and payments that would be made. Chidiac gave Oti a piece of paper with a telephone number, 211-1100, written on it. The number was that of a paging service to which Chidiac was a subscriber.

[8] Shortly thereafter Chidiac left Honiara and telephoned Oti from Vanuatu. Chidiac returned to Sydney on 6 June 1985. George again telephoned Oti and told him to expect a further parcel. More packages arrived as before. This time the powder was white. Oti telephoned George and then Chidiac. The latter said he would send Oti money for the airfare from Honiara. The money arrived and on 1 July 1985 Kwalu flew from Honiara to Brisbane with the packages taped to his body. On 3 July 1985 he telephoned George. Asfour then telephoned Kwalu and the next day Kwalu travelled by bus to Sydney where he was met by Asfour and was later introduced to Samir Helais. Helais was a bookmaker's clerk who worked for Chidiac, the latter being a bookmaker by occupation. Kwalu went to Asfour's house with Asfour where he gave the packages to Asfour. Asfour and Helais divided the white powder between them. Kwalu remained in Sydney for a short time during which he met George. He returned to Honiara and further funds were sent from Sydney to Oti.”


	
	The Crown case depended critically upon the jury finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had discussed drug importation with Oti and Kwalu in Honiara in May 1985. Any discounting of other aspects of the evidence of these two principal witnesses would be relevant to their credibility and reliability on this issue. But unless the jury felt a reasonable doubt about the critical conversations of May 1985 in Honiara the charge of conspiracy would be sustained.
	


Evidence-in-chief of Oti at trial


	
	The events summarised in pars 2 to 6 of Dawson J’s judgment were given in evidence by Oti and Kwalu in terms broadly consistent as between the two witnesses. Expanding upon Dawson J’s summary in respects specifically relevant to the grounds and submissions in this appeal, there may be extracted the following aspects of Oti’s evidence at trial which went directly to proof of the appellant’s participation in the conspiracy:
	



	
	George, who had been Oti’s principal contact in relation to importing drugs into Australia in October 1984 and February 1985, notified Oti in early May 1985 that “Neil” would come to Honiara “to see me to discuss about redirecting some of the same packages to Sydney” (AB 2/382).
	
	
	The appellant arrived in Honiara on 27 May 1985, contacted Oti by telephone and arranged to meet him at the appellant’s hotel, the Mendana. They met in the foyer at about 5pm, went to the appellant’s suite and spoke there in a room separate from the appellant’s family for about 30 minutes.
	
	
	During this conversation the appellant said:
	


“This is a dangerous job and we have to trust each other and I am not like other people, ripping off others. As soon as you receive this stuff, just let me know and I will pay you straight away, even before you send this stuff to Australia” (AB 2/384).


	
	The appellant told Oti that George had informed him “about the previous transactions [Oti] had dealt with [George]” and had requested the appellant “to see me [Oti] to discuss a further shipment of the stuff from Malaysia”.
	
	
	The appellant discussed with Oti methods of concealing drugs for importation into Australia, including removing the tobacco portion of cigarettes, substituting drugs in the cigarette packets and replacing the butts. The appellant also suggested that Oti should purchase carvings, hollow them out and fill them with drugs and send the carvings to Sydney.
	
	
	Oti told the appellant that he might arrange for Kwalu to carry drugs into Australia. The appellant said he would like to meet Kwalu. Oti arranged this for the next day.
	
	
	Oti and Kwalu met the appellant in his hotel suite on 28 May 1985 at about 5:30pm for about 20 – 30 minutes. The conversation commenced to the following effect:
	


“As best I can recall, Neil went over what he had discussed with me the previous day and he said that he would pay us $10,000 per kilo and he went on to say that even if we sent sugar or whatever, he would still pay us because he said ‘soon as you receive the stuff and you let me know, I will send you the money. I will pay you straight away. And even if I receive sugar, whatever that is too late, I pay for the job you did’” (AB 2/385 – 386).


	
	The appellant told Oti and Kwalu that they should make sure “the stuff” is wrapped in plastic “otherwise it will get wet and become useless”.
	
	
	Oti had previously requested George, over the telephone, to provide him with $250 “pocket money”. The appellant gave Oti two $100 notes saying that the money was from George and that it was all he had provided.
	
	
	The appellant gave Oti a piece of paper with the Sydney telephone number 211-1100 on it. The appellant said “if you ring up, and most of the time I won’t be there, just leave a message and say ‘this is Alf’.”
	
	
	After this second meeting with the appellant (in company with Kwalu) in Honiara, Oti did not see the appellant again. However the appellant telephoned him soon afterwards saying that he was in Vila in Vanuatu and that “the stuff should be ready to be sent from Malaysia in a week or two and I will send you some money as soon as you (sic) get back to Sydney”.
	
	
	In about mid-June 1985 George telephoned Oti and told him to check the post office as “the stuff” had left Malaysia. Some time after this two picture frames arrived in packages, addressed to pre-arranged false names: Moli and Tahai. They contained 16 packages of white powder.
	
	
	In late June 1985 the appellant telephoned Oti and said he would send money for an air ticket from Honiara to Brisbane and return. “About a thousand five hundred or so” was sent by telegraphic transfer and collected by Oti from a bank in cash. With this he booked return air travel for Kwalu, Honiara – Brisbane. Oti taped the 16 packages to Kwalu’s body and Kwalu imported them into Australia.
	
	
	In July 1985 Oti received a transfer of AU$9000 from Australia, which he collected from his bank and from which he paid AU$4000 to Kwalu (AB 2/392).
	
	
	In late 1984 and February 1985 Oti and George had discussed Oti’s desire to establish a shop in Honiara. This had also been mentioned in conversation between Oti and the appellant at the Mendana Hotel in May 1985. The appellant had then said he was prepared to help Oti with the business: “I can finance it.”
	
	
	After July 1985 the appellant phoned Oti several times. On one occasion he said:
	


“Alfred, I have heard George and his friends have landed another job so I would like to tell you that I am no longer interested in that business, shop business, and I don’t want to know anything about that other thing that George is arranging, I just want to be out of it altogether” (AB 2/393).


	
	Oti had no further contact with the appellant after this.
	


Evidence-in-chief of Kwalu at trial


	
	The parts of Kwalu’s evidence which directly implicated the appellant in the conspiracy and which are relevant to the grounds and submissions now before this Court, were to this effect:
	



	
	In early 1985 Oti informed Kwalu that a person named Neil would come to Honiara. A little while later Kwalu went with Oti to the Mendana Hotel and met the appellant at about 5:00pm one afternoon. The appellant’s wife and two children were in the suite where they met, in a room adjoining that in which Oti and Kwalu spoke with the appellant (AB 2/507 – 508).
	
	
	The meeting lasted about half an hour. The appellant spoke to the following effect:
	



	
	“be careful, this work is dangerous so be careful” (AB 2/508);
	
	
	“when the drugs come in the yacht you will keep it here in Solomon Island then we will get bit by bit, might be you coming over, or we will send someone to come over” (AB 2/508);
	
	
	the yacht will carry “a large number of drugs, then you keep it in Honiara” (AB 2/508);
	
	
	Oti and Kwalu were to look after the drugs in Honiara;
	
	
	“if you have the drugs with you here, then somebody we send from Australia to come and get it or if not, either one of you can go and get to Australia” (AB 2/545).
	



	
	There was also discussion of the possibility of bringing drugs into Honiara concealed in toys but the appellant “was not interested in the toys”.
	
	
	In July 1985 Kwalu travelled to Brisbane carrying drugs taped to his body in packages. From Brisbane he travelled to Sydney by bus. He stayed in Sydney for a few days in early July 1985 and handed the drugs over to Michael Asfour and another man named Sam. [There was independent evidence that he had stayed at a motel in Randwick from 4 to 8 July 1985].
	


Cross-examination of Oti at trial


	
	When Oti gave evidence at the trial of the applicant he was in prison in New South Wales. In December 1985 he had made a trip from Honiara to Sydney carrying heroin. He was arrested in Sydney on 23 December 1985 and charged with having conspired, between 1 October 1985 and 23 December 1985, with Durak Dursun and divers others to import heroin into Australia. Charges of conspiracy to supply heroin and of possession were also laid.
	
	
	Oti remained in custody from the date of his arrest. In due course he pleaded guilty to the charges. On 3 April 1987 concurrent sentences for all charges were imposed, the longest (for the conspiracy to import) being 20 years commencing 23 December 1985 with a non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	These facts concerning Oti’s position as a witness were all led in evidence before the jury. Copies of written indemnities against prosecution were tendered, including an indemnity from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and an undertaking not to prosecute from the Solomon Islands Director of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	Oti said under cross-examination at the appellant’s trial that in 1987 he had believed that George “dobbed me in”, causing him to be arrested in December 1985. Therefore he had decided to give the police evidence about George. He had discussed this with Durak Dursun, his co-conspirator, who had been convicted and imprisoned with him in relation to the December 1985 importation. Mr Dursun had “told me that George had been a police informer and I will find it difficult to… give evidence against him”. Notwithstanding this advice Oti spoke with police in 1987, before 17 October, in the course of which “They did not mention Neil’s name. …it was me who mentioned Neil’s name”. Oti agreed with defence counsel’s proposition that the police said “they were not interested in George; the man they wanted was Neil”.
	
	
	In cross-examination evidence was adduced from Oti that he had made a first written statement to police on 17 October 1987 and subsequent statements on 1 March 1988 and 1 July 1988. He was examined at committal on 5 July 1988.
	
	
	In his 17 October 1987 statement Oti had said that Kwalu’s first visit to Australia in November 1984 (see par 5 of Dawson J’s summary at [19] above) was a mere holiday paid for by George. Oti first admitted that this trip had been a drug running venture in his statement of 1 July 1988.
	
	
	Oti omitted from the 17 October 1987 statement any reference to his own drug carrying trip in February 1985 (see par 6 of the extract from Dawson J’s judgment at [19] above). At committal he at first maintained, consistently with his statements, that there had only been three drug carrying trips from Honiara to Australia: two by Kwalu in November 1984 and July 1985 and one by himself in December 1985 when he was caught. Under cross-examination at committal he admitted to his own further trip in February 1985.
	
	
	During cross-examination at committal Oti also admitted that he had deliberately lied to police about George’s first visit to Australia and that he had lied both to police and in the early part of his committal evidence about there only having been three trips in total.
	
	
	Under cross-examination at trial Oti characterised these falsehoods as “suppressions of the truth”. The topics in relation to which deliberate untruths on prior occasions were admitted were collateral to the passages of Oti’s evidence which specifically proved adherence of the appellant to the conspiracy from May 1985. Cross-examination concerning Oti’s description of the appellant’s visit to Honiara and his subsequent telephone conversations with the appellant did not expose any significant contradictions or inconsistencies from one police statement to the next or from the police statements and committal evidence to the evidence-in-chief at trial.
	
	
	Oti was heavily challenged about his account of the meeting and conversations in Honiara and about subsequent telephone conversations with the appellant. He acknowledged some differences of recollection on these matters from time to time but denied that he was lying about them or had ever lied about them. He also rejected the proposition, repeatedly put to him, that he had encouraged Kwalu to tell lies about the dealings of the two men with the appellant in Honiara.
	


The Crown case at trial apart from Oti and Kwalu


	
	The Crown tendered evidence to show that the appellant was in 1985 a subscriber to a paging service which operated through a message dispatch centre having the Sydney phone number 211-1100 – the number Oti said he had been given by the appellant in Honiara in May 1985 (see [21](10)). Exhibit 41 at the appellant’s trial was a printed pro-forma Paging Service-Rental Agreement issued by Page Call International Pty Ltd trading as Voice Call. In this document the printed items and handwritten entries against them were (so far as material for present purposes) as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Printed items

	Against the printed words “Personal particulars”, the name “Jacob” was written in a different pen and possibly in a different hand from the writing of “Neil Chidiac”. The only signature on the document is that of the appellant. Prima facie the document is evidence that the appellant had a pager service with Voice Call from 21 June 1984. The receipted payment of $584 accords with the company’s charges for supply of the pager device plus the first quarter’s service fees. Evidence at the trial explained “To page for pay” as meaning that the company would page the customer to request recurrent quarterly fees, rather than issue invoices. “AN” is an acronym for alpha numeric.
	
	
	There was uncontested evidence that in 1985 Voice Call subscribed to a telephone service having the Sydney number 211-1100. This was also formally admitted by the appellant pursuant to s 404 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Ex 46).
	
	
	Jayne Hunter, an employee of Voice Call, gave evidence for the Crown that the pager with serial number 3158 referred to on this Paging Service-Rental Agreement was an alphanumeric device. A message comprising letters and figures of up to 80 characters could be sent to it. A person wishing to leave a message through the service could do so without knowing the number of the relevant subscriber’s pager. It would be sufficient for a caller to quote the name of the subscriber. Even with part only of a full name the operator might still be able to identify the intended recipient of the message although “there might be some trouble in finding who they want”.
	
	
	In cross-examination Ms Hunter said that the first payment from the appellant which the company “can trace” was a payment made in about November 1985. She said it was possible that the service contract had been entered into by some person other than the appellant and then transferred to him in November 1985. Cecilia Dries, who also worked for Voice Call, confirmed that the earliest record she could find of a payment having been made by the appellant for this service was a receipt from November 1985. She made her search in response to a subpoena issued in connection with the trial. Her evidence did not exclude the possibility that earlier payments may have been made by the appellant, of which no record was held at the time she made her search.
	
	
	The Crown adduced evidence of the appellant’s travel movements in May and June 1985. Some of these were formally admitted under s 404 Crimes Act. The result was unchallenged evidence of the following chronology of air travel by the appellant, his partner Ilona Vallejo and his two children, a boy aged eight years and a girl of three years:
	



	
	27 May 1985: departed Brisbane and arrived in Honiara.
	
	
	31 May 1985: departed Honiara and arrived in Vanuatu.
	
	
	2 June 1985: departed Vanuatu and arrived in Nadi, Fiji.
	
	
	6 June 1985: departed Nadi, Fiji, and arrived in Sydney.
	


George not called at trial


	
	On the first day of the trial the AFP applied to the presiding judge for an order suppressing the full name of George and any information capable of revealing his identity. This application was supported by a confidential affidavit the contents of which were not revealed to the Crown prosecutor. Public interest immunity was claimed and upheld in respect of the affidavit. The trial judge made orders as sought including that George should be referred to throughout the proceedings only by that name. His Honour expressly reserved liberty to either party to apply to have this suppression order lifted or varied if the revelation of the identity of George should become significant to issues in the trial.
	
	
	From the making of this application by the AFP, supported by an affidavit which was protected by public interest immunity, the experienced counsel who appeared for the appellant would have drawn the inescapable inference that George was a police informant. The cross-examination in which Oti gave evidence of Durak Dursun’s assertion that George was “a police informer” (see [26] above) took place on the second day of the trial and would have reinforced the inference.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant would have been well aware that George had not been charged with any offences arising out of the importations of drugs from Honiara into Australia as described in the evidence of Oti and Kwalu. If he was not so aware it would only have been through deliberate want of inquiry. Detective Sergeant Venchiarutti acknowledged in cross-examination at the trial that George was involved in all four of the drug importations described by Oti and Kwalu. The Detective said he had never spoken to George. He gave these answers to the appellant’s counsel at AB 2/600 – 602:
	


“Q. You knew that he [George] had a prominent part to play in the conspiracy we are dealing with here?

A. Yes.

Q. That he had a prominent part to play in the first run of Mr Kwalu?

A. Yes.

Q. And you are aware that he had a prominent part to play in Mr Oti’s first run?

A. I am aware he had some involvement there the exact involvement I do not know.

Q. Officer, have you been deliberately avoiding making any inquiries into George?

A. No.

Q. Were you instructed not to make any inquiries into George?

A. Not in so many words.

Q. Was it hinted to you do not make any inquiries into George?

A. It was an understanding I had with conversations with senior police that I would not make certain inquiries in relation to George.

Q. Was the summary of this understanding, keep George out of it as far as possible?

A. No.

…

Q. Have you seen material in respect of George’s involvement in that 1985 run in which Oti was arrested?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that material indicate that he was a part of it and – ?

A. Yes.

Q. That he was allowed to escape while all others were to be rounded up?

A. No.

Q. He was allowed to escape, isn’t that so?

A. I don’t know the exact details of it whether he was or was not, I am aware he was not charged in relation to that matter.

Q. That was by design?

A. I don’t know.

…

Q. I suggest to you that when you became aware of George’s involvement in this whole chain of events from the first time he met them in 1979\80 until 1985 you wanted to put George’s name on the list of people to be watched in case they had left the country?

A. No, I didn’t.

Q. I suggest to you that you were told not to put his name on the list?

A. No, that is incorrect.

Q. You were not told directly is that what you are saying?

A. In relation to the alert on George it was never raised between me and my senior officers.

…

Q. What arrangements did you make with other police [for George’s name to be put on a watch list or alert at points of international departure]?

A. Discussions – (objected to; allowed)

Q. Could you answer that question?

A. I had discussions with police concerning George and the outcome of those discussions led me not to consider putting him on the alert.

Q. A moment ago [you said] it had never even crossed your mind?

A. That’s right because of the discussions I had with other officers.”


	
	Again from this evidence it would have been clear to the appellant’s counsel that George must have been a police informant. There was no other reason why his name would not have been put on an alert with respect to overseas departure when police had, at latest from receipt of Oti’s 17 October 1987 statement, ample prima facie evidence of George’s involvement in the two importations to which Oti was then admitting (those of July and December 1985). The framing of counsel’s questions indicated that he positively believed George had co-operated with police.
	
	
	From all of this the appellant’s counsel would have very well understood why George was not called in the Crown case. Namely, because police preferred to minimise his exposure to identification through the trial process and to preserve his utility as an informant. It must have appeared to the appellant’s counsel that unless George was an informant there could have been no reason why he would not have been charged as a co-conspirator with the appellant in relation to the July 1985 importation and with other persons in relation to the importations of November 1984 and February 1985 (both of which were described in supplementary statements from Oti and Kwalu, served prior to the committal in early July 1988) and in relation to the importation of December 1985 (in which Oti had implicated George in his record of interview conducted on the day he and Mr Dursun were arrested).
	


The appellant’s dock statement


	
	The appellant made an unsworn statement from the dock from which the following points are material for the purposes of this appeal:
	



	
	He denied having any knowledge of or connection with Michael Asfour, his co-accused and alleged co-conspirator, during the charge period.
	
	
	The appellant said he had never heard of George until his name was introduced in the prosecution case against him. He had no association with George.
	
	
	He denied having seen or heard of Wilson Kwalu until the committal proceedings.
	
	
	In 1985 the appellant had been carrying on business as a bookmaker in which he employed Samir Helais as his clerk. He denied having conspired with Samir Helais to import drugs into Australia.
	
	
	With reference to evidence in the Crown case that Samir Helais had in 1987 sold his house and then left Australia on 24 December 1987, about two months after Oti made his first statement, the appellant said he was not told by Helais that he intended to sell his house and depart.
	
	
	The appellant had planned a family holiday with his children for May 1985 during school holidays. He postponed his departure until the day after his brother’s wedding. At the reception for this wedding Samir Helais had said “I have a contact in Honiara and when you get there just look him up, he might help you to get around and tell you something about the island”. The named contact was Alfred Oti, whom the appellant contacted with the assistance of someone on the reception desk at his hotel in Honiara.
	
	
	“So, I rang him [Oti] up and I told him who I am. He didn’t have the faintest idea who the hell I am. He said, who is Neil and all this rubbish about Sam’s arriving to Honiara then Sam change his mind and Neil is arriving to Honiara. The (sic) he didn’t know anything about that whatsoever of the the only thing he could relate to Sam a Sam from Sydney.”
	
	
	The appellant arranged for Oti to meet him at the appellant’s hotel. Oti arrived “fully intoxicated” and drank more after he arrived. Their conversation was primarily about a shop which Oti wanted to open in Honiara and Oti’s invitation to the appellant to be a partner in this proposed business: “Never he mentioned anything about Wilson Kwalu and if he mentioned anything about George I didn’t notice.”
	
	
	Oti visited the appellant’s hotel again around 6 or 7 o’clock the next evening: “We were just about to go for dinner. I talked to him for a couple of minutes. I tried to fob him off. He asked for some more money. I gave him $20 for a drink and he stayed at the bar while we had dinner.”
	
	
	The appellant telephoned Samir Helais from Honiara but only to say that he was “not impressed whatsoever” with Oti’s attitude. Helais told the appellant that when the appellant had returned to Sydney “I will explain it all to you.” The appellant said nothing in this dock statement about whether Helais and himself ever subsequently discussed Oti.
	
	
	From Honiara the appellant and his family flew to Fiji where he met his “engineer who designed the house in 1981”. This was apparently a reference to a house the appellant was having built at Clovelly in the eastern suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	After the brief encounter in Honiara the appellant “forgot about Oti from there on, never heard of him. Never spoke to him again and all this story about how drugs was discussed there and how to import it from Honiara and as you heard all along this trial it is nothing but a big lie. Big fabricated lie. …There was no money sent to him, that is Alfred Oti and never rang him from Sydney.”
	
	
	The appellant “bought a Voice Call” (apparently meaning a pager device suitable for use with Voice Call’s service) “privately for $200 some time in November 85 or December 85. He was told by “the girl… on the switch” at Voice Call that he could not transfer the service into his name and that he should speak to the sales manager. In conversation with the sales manager:
	


“I explained to him the situation of the beeper and he brought a contract with the name of Jacob’s on it. I don’t know how the name got to it. But that is the contract with Jacob’s on it. He said ‘don’t worry about it we use this contract nothing to worry it will transferred in your name in no time’… I made 3 months in advance lease on the beeper and there has been no previous record to say I paid earlier payments than that. That was in December 85.”


	
	In late May 1985 (the time when Oti said the appellant had provided the Voice Call service number and arranged for future contact by this means) the appellant did not have a beeper and did not know the Voice Call service number.
	


Circumstances of Oti giving evidence at trial


	
	It is critical to our consideration of ground 1 to determine whether evidence of certain “previous representations” made by Oti several years after the trial are admissible on this appeal pursuant to s 65(2)(d) Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). The term “previous representations”, taken from s 65, here applies to representations made by Oti previous to the hearing of this appeal, in which he purported to recant the evidence he had given at the trial in early 1989.
	
	
	For reasons developed later in this judgment, admissibility of the evidence of these recantations will turn upon whether they were “made in circumstances that make it likely that the [representations are] reliable” (s 65(2)(d)). The circumstances in which Oti came to give his original evidence against the appellant in early 1989 have a bearing upon the question whether his subsequent recantations are “likely” to be reliable. Given that the “previous representations” are a purported unsworn recantation of evidence earlier given on oath, the context in which the earlier sworn testimony was given and the content of that testimony are in our view so connected with the subsequent recantation as to make that context and content a material part of the circumstances in which the recantations were made, relevantly for the application of s 65(2)(d).
	


Detective Venchiarutti’s evidence of the origins of Oti’s co-operation


	
	Part of the context in which Oti came to give evidence for the Crown was adduced from him at trial as referred to at [23] – [32]. That is, that he thought George had “dobbed me in”, decided therefore to talk to police and was told by them that they were interested in any evidence he could give against the appellant.
	
	
	On the hearing of this appeal AFP agent Venchiarutti, now Detective Superintendent, deposed that he was informed by senior officers on 27 September 1987 that Oti may be willing to speak to police. On 14 October 1987 he met with Oti at the Metropolitan Reception Prison where Oti was serving his sentence. Oti told the detective that he had “become closer to God” whilst in custody and that he now wished to assist authorities, asking that consideration be given to five matters for his benefit. Namely:
	


(1)   indemnity for himself and Kwalu;

(2)   protection for himself and Kwalu;

(3)   opportunity to continue in prison theological studies which he said he was undertaking to further his commitment to God;

(4)   representation at any application for parole or release on licence regarding any assistance he might give to police and

(5)   suppression of his name.


	
	Detective Venchiarutti took Oti’s first statement, which was signed on 17 October 1987, by asking him questions and incorporating the responses into a narrative. Thereafter the AFP made their own enquiries to gather evidence which might confirm points in Oti’s account from sources independent of him. These enquiries were pursued in the Solomon Islands where Detective Venchiarutti gathered business records of banks and travel agents and took a statement from Wilson Kwalu.
	
	
	By 30 March 1988 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had indicated a willingness to grant indemnity for both Oti and Kwalu. On 20 April 1988 the Director issued the indemnities. Indemnities from prosecuting authorities in other relevant jurisdictions and a personal undertaking from the Solomon Islands Attorney-General not to use the evidence given by Oti and Kwalu against them were issued in May and June 1988. In accordance with Oti’s requests he was placed under protection in custody.
	
	
	In an affidavit read on the hearing of this appeal Detective Venchiarutti deposed that neither Oti nor Kwalu was ever threatened by himself or by any other police officer to his knowledge to induce their co-operation with authorities. He deposed that both of them provided information, including their original and supplementary statements, of their own free will. In examination on this appeal it was put to Detective Venchiarutti that what he “really did [in interviewing Oti for his statement] was feed him information by way of, in a sense, assisting him with so-called objective evidence such as” the phone number for the Voice Call pager service. More sweepingly it was put to Detective Venchiarutti that he “fed the man Oti information in relation to the man Chidiac” which Oti “regurgitated in the statement you took from him”.
	
	
	The detective denied both of these propositions and we accept his denials. The information which Detective Venchiarutti might have “fed” to Oti was not specified in the questions put to him in the cross-examination referred to in the preceding paragraph. Nor was there any evidence that in October 1987 the officers had independent information – such as the appellant’s travel movements, hotel bookings, phone numbers, records of phone calls made, banking transactions or the like – which could have been “fed” to Oti to enable him to fabricate an incriminating narrative around them. Such independent material was obtained months after Oti had signed his statement.
	
	
	Oti’s statement of 17 October 1987 relates to his meetings with the appellant at the Mendana Hotel in Honiara in “late May or early June 1985”. He identified the appellant on a photo board. The statement recounts the substance of the meetings in terms substantially to the effect which he later gave in evidence at the trial of the appellant (see [21]), including the fact that the appellant provided to him the telephone number of the Voice Call switchboard, 211-1100. All of this detail respecting the appellant was given in Oti’s first statement before the police had obtained confirmatory business records. These were not obtained until early in 1988.
	
	
	There is nothing in the evidence to cause the Court to doubt that Oti came to give his evidence against the appellant in the circumstances described by Oti himself at the trial and expanded upon by Detective Venchiarutti before us. It is not inherently implausible that Oti, facing a long sentence in a gaol far from his own country and suspecting that he had been “dobbed in”, should co-operate with police in exchange for, inter alia, their support for a reduction of sentence. There is nothing in the circumstances to make it inherently likely that Oti would have given a false account in this situation, in particular an account containing false allegations against the appellant. Oti’s own explanation, given on oath at the trial, was that he wished to provide police with a case against George. The motivation for this was not gratuitous malice against an unconnected innocent person. It arose from Oti’s contention that George had been involved in the sequence of importations and his belief that George had informed on him. Other evidence in the appeal establishes that George was a police informer in 1985.
	
	
	Subject to our ruling on admissibility of Oti’s out-of-court unsworn recantations, dating from November 1994 and March 1997, there is no admissible evidence that Oti produced his statements and later gave evidence at the trial under pressure from police in any way which would cast doubt upon the reliability of that evidence. Nor is there evidence of any improper inducement. There was no impropriety in Oti having been informed that his co-operation would be taken into account for reduction of sentence. It is the policy of the law to encourage offenders to provide information to police and to give credit for such assistance in reduction of sentence. This is reflected in current sentencing legislation of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales and has been recognised by the courts in sentencing principles restated over decades: R v Perez-Vargas; R v Stevens (1986) 8 NSWLR 559; R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243.
	


Durak Dursun’s account of a recantation letter or letters of late 1989


	
	Evidence was given on this appeal by Durak Dursun (Oti’s co-conspirator in relation to the 1985 drug importation for which both were imprisoned) and Ian Jameson (a private investigator) of events which were said to have prompted an approach to Oti in November 1994 to obtain written and oral recantation of his trial evidence. Mr Dursun swore an affidavit in which he adopted a record of interview between himself and Bill Tunstall, Mr Jameson’s partner in a private investigation business. The interview between Mr Tunstall and Mr Dursun had taken place on 14 July 1994 whilst the appellant was still serving his sentence. Mr Dursun had been released on 15 September 1993 having served one week short of 7 years and 9 months in prison.
	
	
	The interview contains statements by Mr Dursun to the following effect, so far as relevant to the present appeal:
	



	
	George was involved in importations of heroin from Malaysia into Australia via Honiara in 1985 including the importation of December 1985 for which Oti and Mr Dursun were prosecuted and convicted.
	
	
	George was a police informer who had “set up” Dursun and Oti.
	
	
	Mr Dursun used to “look after [Oti, in prison] because he was scared… he doesn’t know nobody here and plus he is a Custom Officers (sic)…”.
	
	
	In prison Oti “never mentioned Neil Chidiac’s name or anything he always mention, he wants to fix George… up for putting him into gaol like he do, he would like George… to do time like he done…”.
	
	
	The investigator showed Mr Dursun a statutory declaration, apparently drafted for Mr Dursun to swear. It contained statements that police “intentionally convinced Oti to fabricate the evidence of what he was involved in and implicate Neil Chidiac instead”. The statutory declaration also contained words to the effect that police had recruited Kwalu “to fabricate and back up Oti’s version of the events”. It appears that this statutory declaration had been drawn up prior to the interview and was presented to Mr Dursun with a view to having it adopted. However he said that he could not write or read English and he did not adopt it.
	
	
	Whilst both Oti and Mr Dursun were in gaol Oti wrote to Mr Dursun a number of letters to the effect that he felt bad because he had put an innocent man, the appellant, in prison. Mr Dursun did not have the originals or copies of these letters but undertook to Mr Tunstall that he would search for them amongst his possessions. These letters were sent between the two men from one gaol to another whilst they were held separately, Oti being in protection. Mr Dursun was asked whether Mr Oti said that he “[g]ave the wrong evidence” and Mr Dursun replied “[y]eah wrong evidence”. According to Mr Dursun Oti did not explain in these letters “why he gave the wrong evidence against Neil Chidiac”. Mr Dursun offered his own speculation that “maybe the police force him to”.
	
	
	Mr Dursun had never heard of Neil Chidiac until he read in the newspapers about him having been arrested and charged with conspiracy to import drugs. Up until then George had never mentioned Mr Chidiac. After this Mr Dursun met the appellant when both were serving their respective sentences in Parklea gaol. In the interview Mr Dursan described this meeting as follows:
	


“And when I go to Parklea I show the, that letter to Neil Chidiac. …You know I feel sorry for him or something… And then after Neil Chidiac wasn’t worried about it at first. He’s you know, and after he’s realised after, I give him that letter that I think’s true you know, but I don’t know whether I give him or didn’t give him…”.


	
	Mr Dursun did not have the letters or any of them with him at the time of the interview but said he would search for them, they were “probably at my brothers (sic) garage or somewhere”.
	
	
	After Mr Dursun was released from prison he rang Oti once, in 1993, and “I say how are you you know, how’s your family and all that”. Mr Dursun agreed that he would be willing to ring Oti again and talk to him.
	



	
	In oral evidence given at the hearing of this appeal Mr Dursun referred to only one letter from Oti on the subject of his having given false evidence against the appellant, rather than a series of letters as referred to in the July 1994 record of interview. He said that he and Oti were together in Long Bay on remand for 18 months. Then Oti was moved into protection at Long Bay and Mr Dursun was moved to Goulburn. The letter was sent from Oti’s protective custody to Mr Dursun at Goulburn.
	
	
	Mr Dursun said that the letter was to the effect: “Sorry what I done wrong with these people and they put me in the corner, I have to say what I have to say. Make me a liar… I’m very sorry for what I have done to these people”. He gave these further answers (at T 87 – 88):
	


“A. …when I get the change to Parklea, I hand letter to Mr Chidiac, maybe help him with his case if this guy is telling the truth, what he writes in the letter, he done something wrong to some people so he’s asking, ‘Sorry what I done to other people’, so I give it to help the court case and the people.

…

A. …I just seen Neil Chidiac – from Parklea I give it to him, he give me back the letter, he says he doesn’t need this letter for freedom because everything in black and white so he give the letter back to me and I ripped it up and threw it in the rubbish.

…

Q. You didn’t think you should keep it?

A. What I keep it for? I already give Neil Chidiac the letter. He comes back two weeks later and says, ‘I don’t need this letter for freedom’ because his case is very strong for his side so he give the letter back to me. I don’t want to keep it, I don’t need that letter.”


	
	Mr Dursun’s best estimate of when he had given the letter to Mr Chidiac was “three years before I get released”, which would have been about the second half of 1989.
	
	
	In a record of interview conducted in Honiara by Mr Jameson on 23 November 1994 (see [72] – [92] below) Oti said that he sent a letter (not multiple letters) to Mr Dursun while they were both in gaol (at [83]). In this he had apologised for having given evidence against the appellant and had written that he “was sort of cornered” and had not intended “to put Neil in gaol”. He told Mr Jameson that he did not have a copy of the letter. He was not asked and did not say why he had written in this vein to Mr Dursun, a man with whom Oti has never asserted that the appellant had any connection. He was not asked and did not say why he had not written directly to the appellant, who was also in gaol at the time the letter was said to have been sent. The Court is not satisfied that any such letter was even written.
	


Oti’s handwritten recantation, 23 November 1994


	
	The appellant tendered on this appeal three documents purporting to contain statements by Oti contradicting and retracting the evidence he gave at the appellant’s trial in January and February 1989. The first is of three and a half pages said to be in Oti’s handwriting and signed by him dated 23 November 1994. Oti had been released from prison on 22 June 1991 and by November 1994 he was again residing in Honiara.
	
	
	The handwritten statement is to the following effect:
	



	
	After Oti had been sentenced (on 3 April 1987) Detective Venchiarutti and another officer visited him in prison and said they
	


“had known about my other involvement in importing of drugs into Australia and they mentioned Neil Chidiac as one of my conspirators. I was asked to tell everything about this particular importations, otherwise I would spend a very long time in gaol… . They told me to make statements against Neil but most of what I had alleged were not correct or true because of pressure… I was afraid the police might give me additional sentence to what I had already got”.


	
	Reasons for (purportedly) giving the truth in this handwritten statement were stated thus:
	


“[N]ow I am out of gaol and served my time I could now give the true events or statement of the drugs importation that implicated Neil and landed him. Therefore, I am no longer afraid of getting any more sentence from the Police. I am now reformed and I’ve been a dedicated Christian since I had got out of gaol.”


	
	The appellant “was not involved in any drugs importations that I am aware of”.
	
	
	Oti met the appellant and his family in Honiara at their hotel but this was only to “chat and to say hello”. Oti only ever received $40 or $50 from the appellant which Oti had requested at the hotel in Honiara “for ‘booze’”. There was no discussion between Oti and Chidiac (with or without Kwalu) concerning the importation of drugs.
	


Durak Dursun’s account of obtaining Oti’s recantations, 23 November 1994


	
	Mr Dursun agreed he went to the Solomon Islands in 1994 with Ian Jameson to obtain a statement from Oti, which in the event was the statement of 23 November 1994 referred to at [62] and [63]. Mr Dursun said this trip came about because “a couple of lawyers and people” came to ask him about the letter after he had been released and he said to them “I just put the letter in the rubbish but if you want me to talk to Mr Oti, I can talk to him and get a statement from him, it’s better to help you out for the court”. He told them “if you want a letter from the guy, I can get it in writing another letter exactly what he’s writing”. The day after this the “couple of lawyers and people” got permission from Mr Dursun’s parole officer for him to go overseas for a week with Ian Jameson to get a statement from Oti.
	
	
	Mr Dursun claimed that he went to visit the appellant in Parramatta Correctional Centre before going to Honiara and that the appellant asked him to “help me out”. He gave this evidence at [T 90]:
	


“Q. Did he say specifically why he wanted you to go to Honiara?

A. Because no one talked to Alfred Oti, he doesn’t trust anybody except me. I can get this information without doing anything wrong, you know.”


	
	This answer is inherently contradictory. If neither the appellant nor anyone acting on his behalf had spoken to Oti then they would not know whether he did or did not trust persons other than Mr Dursun. Mr Dursun was asked why it would not have been sufficient for him to ring Oti and arrange for him to meet Mr Jameson who was, in any event, going to Honiara in the capacity of private investigator on Mr Chidiac’s behalf. Over the course of a page of questioning recorded in the transcript at T 90 – 91 Mr Dursun failed to give any satisfactory explanation for why it was necessary or useful for him as well as Mr Jameson to go to Honiara.
	
	
	Mr Dursun said that when he did travel to Honiara with Mr Jameson in 1994 he contacted Oti and arranged a meeting at a hotel where he left the two of them together for the taking of the statement. (In cross-examination he said he remained present for “most of the time”). Prior to this meeting he told Oti that he wanted a letter similar to the one Oti had sent whilst in prison, “…‘no lying, no one pushing you to lie. If you don’t want to talk you don’t want to talk. It’s up to you. …this man is going to do interview and tell the truth, brother’.” (T 95). He told Oti that he had thrown the previous letter in the rubbish and wanted a new, similar letter to take to the courts. Mr Dursun said he did not read what Oti wrote that day as he is not proficient in reading or writing English. Mr Jameson said he was happy with what he got from Oti and therefore Mr Dursun was not concerned to see the content.
	
	
	Mr Dursun denied that Mr Oti was paid any money for making the handwritten statement of 23 November 1994 or for participating in a recorded interview with Mr Jameson (to which further reference will be made shortly). He also denied that he attended in Honiara for the purpose of standing over Mr Oti or that he did in fact stand over him. He said the statement was taken over about two hours, which we infer would include the conduct of the recorded interview between Mr Jameson and Oti.
	


Ian Jameson’s account of obtaining Oti’s recantations, 23 November 1994


	
	In an affidavit read on the hearing of the appeal Mr Jameson deposed that he visited the appellant at Berrima Correctional Centre whilst the appellant was serving his sentence. No date is given but this is likely to have occurred in about the first half of 1994. Mr Jameson was asked by the appellant’s solicitor to conduct inquiries in relation to the offence for which the appellant had been imprisoned, including re-interviewing witnesses and co-offenders. Mr Jameson deposed that Mr Dursun was asked to act as an intermediary with Oti because Oti “had a great fear of all police” and Mr Jameson wanted someone to assure Oti “that we were not working for the police and we were not attempting to endanger anyone else including Mr Oti”.
	
	
	Mr Jameson further deposed that he met Oti in Honiara and asked him to prepare a written statement, which resulted in Oti writing out the document of 23 November 1994 referred to at [62] and [63]. Mr Jameson also conducted a taped record of interview. He identified and authenticated a transcript of that record of interview, also made 23 November 1994. According to Mr Jameson no gifts or rewards were provided to Oti.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Jameson described Mr Dursun as a “likeable larrikin” and said that the reason for having him ring Oti before they flew to Honiara and for taking Mr Dursun on the trip was to “allay Oti’s fears that I wasn’t there for any other purpose apart from to gain the truth about Neil…”.
	


Oti’s record of interview, 23 November 1994


	
	The transcript of Mr Jameson’s taped record of interview with Oti on 23 November 1994 covers 46 pages. The content of the first one third of it may be summarised, by reference to page numbers, as follows:
	


1 – 2: Confirmation by Oti that the handwritten statement of the same date had been made by him and was correct.

2 – 10: Outline of Oti’s first meeting with George in Honiara in 1979 or 1980 and of the first importations into Australia in 1984 and 1985. The answers in this part of the record of interview are for the most part to the same effect as Oti’s evidence-in-chief at the trial of the appellant including the fact that the appellant was in Honiara in May 1985 – but omitting the content of Oti’s conversations with him and omitting any account of subsequent telephone communications between them.

10.8: Oti denied that when he had been speaking to the appellant in Honiara there had been any discussion of importing drugs.

11: Detective Venchiarutti had interviewed Oti in custody and told him police had been trying to “get” the appellant “for drugs”.

11 – 12: Earlier, at the time of his arrest, Oti had told other police officers “the full story” of George’s involvement but not of that of Sam Helais, Michael Asfour or Durak Dursun.

12 – 15: Oti gave an account of how he came to make his first statement implicating the appellant. He said Detective Venchiarutti told him that police believed the appellant was involved in importations. He was “asked to tell everything about this particular importations (sic), referring to Neil Chidiac, otherwise I would spend a very long time in gaol”. He did not assert that he was told, in terms, an additional sentence was going to be added to that which he was already serving but rather that he “got that impression” from what the police said to him. He gave these answers:

“Q: …But as you have said earlier Neil had no involvement in the drug importation. Why did you say that he did have?

A: It was Err a came up with the assumption that he was involved in the Err drugs Err involvement. Because of Sam Helais and [George] and they informed me that Err Neil was come for a holiday and I was going to met (sic) him. And I thought Err I assumed that he was involved with them with drugs importation.

Q: Right. And for that reason… did you take opportunity of the fact that Neil had come here for a holiday visit to tell the police that he was involved sso… (sic) that you would get a shorter sentence.

A: Yes.”

15 – 17: Oti said he tried to tell the police interviewing him about the involvement of George and Sam Helais but they did not appear interested.

17 – 18: Oti reiterated the part of his handwritten statement of 23 November 1994 in which he claimed he never saw Kwalu have a conversation with the appellant and said that the three of them had not discussed importation of drugs together.


	
	At pp 18 – 19 Oti gave the following answers in an attempt to explain the difference between the information he was giving to Mr Jameson in November 1994 and the evidence he had given at the appellant’s trial:
	


“Q: [Y]ou’ve now… reformed and you are a dedicated Christian since you got out of gaol.

A. Yes.

Q: I have read the transcript of the court proceeding [i.e. the appellant’s trial] and in those proceedings you had also said that you were reformed.

A: Yes

Q: And then telling the truth

A: Reformed not in another sense. In another sense not in the same as I’m in now.

Q: Right. So can you explain that for me?

A: For what I meant then was I had not been a dedicated Christian or going to church for over 20 years until I went into gaol. I started to go to church and saying prayers.

Q: And you say that you now you have reformed since you’ve got out of gaol. What has reformed you since you got out of gaol?

A: Arr… Now I have been reformed arr… meaning that I have been born again, Which is different from the time I was in gaol.”


	
	At p 19 there was also an attempt by Oti to explain his change in position by reference to reform from alcoholism:
	


“Q: Can you tell me now why some person or any other person would believe what your (sic) saying now to being the truth as distinct what (sic) you said before.

A: Well before I was content drunked and Err and I my memory was not Err I couldn’t remember things well. And I had confused mind. And now I have gone off these Err off these Err alcohol and Err I believe what I say now is clear with a clear conscious (sic) Err.”


	
	Further, on p 19 having said that he now acknowledged the appellant “is an innocent man”, he gave these answers:
	


“Q: And by innocent can you explain that in relation that (sic) to this drug importation?

A: Err what Err by innocent, Err innocence, I mean that Err I feel that he was being used by George and Sam. Err and Err as far as I am concerned I really don’t understand his Err his friend, friendship side with these two guys. So art (sic) that time I assumed he was involved with drugs but now it sort um… of come clear to me but picture clearer now that he was not involved at all. I had the wrong Err impression Err.

Q: And you say that it was your assumption because of his involvement or association with George and Sam that you assume that he was involved in the drug importations together with those two.

A: Yes”


	
	At pp 20 – 21 the questions and answers reverted to the subject of what Detective Venchiarutti had said in 1987 when encouraging Oti to give evidence concerning the appellant (see the summary of pp 12 – 15 above).
	
	
	Then at p 21 the following question and answer appear:
	


“Q: When you say also Wilson Kwalu did not have any conversations with Neil in your presence, in relation to drugs, how did it come about that Wilson Kwalu later gave evidence against him?

A: That I don’t know, how he got about that.”


	
	It is clear that the questioner, Mr Jameson, was aware Kwalu had given evidence at the appellant’s trial which supported Oti’s account of a three way conversation between Oti, Kwalu and the appellant in Honiara in May 1985 concerning the importation of drugs into Australia. It was apparent to the questioner, as it is to the Court, that if Oti had fabricated this evidence at trial then either Kwalu must have collaborated with him about the version of events to be fabricated or, by extraordinary and highly improbable coincidence, Kwalu had fabricated the same story independently. Otherwise the evidence of Kwalu would suggest that that of Oti was a true account of events which both he and Kwalu were able independently to recall.
	
	
	In the questioning at pp 21 – 26 Mr Jameson fully explored with Oti whether he might have intimated to Kwalu the terms of the purportedly false story that Oti was going to tell against the appellant in order to give Kwalu an opportunity to fabricate to the same effect. But Oti said that he had no discussions at all with Kwalu about the appellant during telephone calls from the prison after he had first spoken to Detective Venchiarutti. He agreed that he had written from the prison a letter to Kwalu and given it to Detective Venchiarutti to deliver. In that letter “I just told him to co-operated (sic) with Venchirautti (sic) for what ever questions he asks. …I say something along the lines that Err if [Venchiarutti] asking anything about Neil or anybody else just to answer they Err answer him Err correctly say the truth. Tell them the truth”. Oti denied that he told Kwalu what Oti himself had said to the police about the appellant and denied that he made any suggestion to Kwalu about what the latter might say.
	
	
	In the face of these answers the questioner pressed Oti with the seeming contradiction that the evidence he had given against the appellant, which he now said was fabricated, appeared to have been independently corroborated by Kwalu. Oti endeavoured to reconstruct how this might have come about:
	


“Q: You understand what I saying (sic) is that you have now said that the information you gave was false. … How did [Kwalu] come to corroborate something that was false? Which you Err nnnow (sic) say is false?

A: Err Probably I could have mentioned something in the letter Err but I can’t remember. What I said.”


	
	Mr Jameson pressed Oti yet again with this difficulty at pp 25 – 26:
	


“Q: Because as you say the truth as you now say it. Neil had no involvement in drugs.

A: That’s correct

Q: I’m trying to get you to explain how Wilson could corroborate something that was not true.

A: I now see I think I think I’m not sure what I think Err I mentioned something in that letter or telephone conversation Err something along that line what I told the police in my statement.

Q: Did you tell him that if he gave evidence that evidence against Neil that he would get an indemnity?

A: Yes and that might get decreased sentenced (sic). I remember telling him that.

Q: Was that in the letter?

A: Could be in the letter to (sic).

Q: Or was it on the phone call?

A: Could be both letter and through phone call.

Q: And that was prior to Detective Venchirautti (sic) coming getting a statement from [Kwalu].

A: Yes

Q: In effect you had told him what you had told the police in relation to Neil.

A: Yes

Q: And did you will you said that if you corroborated with what you said he would get an indemnity and you would get a lesser sentence. Is that correct.

A: Yes Yes.”


	
	At pp 26 – 32 questions were asked about the manner in which Oti had been further questioned by the authorities after Kwalu had made his first statement. As referred to at [28], there was a significant discrepancy between Oti’s statement of 17 October 1987 and Kwalu’s first statement in that Oti had asserted Kwalu’s October 1984 visit to Australia was merely a holiday whereas Kwalu acknowledged that it was the first in the series of four importations. Mr Jameson’s questions over these pages explored whether there might have been any impropriety on the part of the police or the Crown in seeking to bring Oti’s evidence into conformity with that of Kwalu. No such impropriety appears from the answers given. The process described is the usual and ethical one of re-interviewing a witness, prior to trial, when information comes to light which casts doubt upon an aspect of his statement to police. In this case that resulted in Oti making his supplementary statement of 1 July 1988 in which he admitted that Kwalu’s 1984 visit to Sydney had been for the purposes of effecting an importation.
	
	
	At p 32 Oti said that he did not again speak to the appellant after the latter left Honiara in May 1985, contrary to the evidence he gave at trial. Also at pp 32 – 33 he said that he had written a letter of regret and recantation to Durak Dursun whilst in prison. This is the passage referred to at [61].
	
	
	At pp 33 – 37 Oti said, consistently with the evidence he had given at trial, that George phoned him in 1985 to say that Sam would be coming to Honiara to see him and that subsequently either George or Sam phoned to say that a different person would be coming, who turned out to be the appellant. He said he had never learned the appellant’s full name until he was giving evidence at the trial. He related visits he had received in gaol from George and George’s girlfriend. Oti said that Durak Dursun had told him in gaol that George was an informer.
	
	
	At pp 38 – 40 Oti was asked about visits he had received from a number of Solomon Islanders whilst he was in gaol and about the value of the drugs he had carried.
	
	
	At pp 40 – 41 Oti answered questions about the manner in which he caused his letter to Kwalu from prison to be delivered. He said he gave it directly to Detective Venchiarutti. Detective Venchiarutti’s evidence on the appeal included that he received the letter through a Corrective Services officer. This subject does not appear to have been of any significance at this point in the record of interview because Oti made no positive assertion to Mr Jameson that the letter communicated an improper invitation to collaborate about giving false evidence against the appellant.
	
	
	At pp 42 – 44 Mr Jameson’s questions were directed to the telephone number for the Voice Call paging service. At p 42 Oti said he was not aware the appellant had a pager at the time of the visit to Honiara on 27 May 1985 but that he had subsequently been told either by Sam Helais or George and that one or other of those two persons gave him the number: “They said this is the contact, contact Neil”. This answer is inconsistent with Oti’s assertion that his meeting with the appellant in Honiara had been purely social, isolated and fleeting, with no subsequent contact or reason for contact. This difficulty must have been apparent to the questioner who continued as follows:
	


“Q: And what was the purpose of [Sam or George] giving of that number?

A: Um… I don’t know why they give me that number.

Q: You don’t know when they gave it to you?

A: No

Q: But after he had been in Honiara. Obviously. Was it when was it in relation to umm… your last arr… when you were arrested on the last occasion and you don’t know the reason they gave it.

A: I don’t know the reason.”


	
	At p 43 the questioner put to Oti a series of leading questions concerning Oti’s evidence at the appellant’s trial to the effect that he had made contact with the appellant using the paging service. Oti told Mr Jameson that that evidence had been false. That was followed up in this manner:
	


“Q: Who asked you to say that?

A: To contact that number?

Q: No who asked you to give the evidence that you’d contacted the pager?

A: the police.

Q: Yes but who?

A: Terry Venchirautti (sic).

Q: How did he come to say that to you?

A: Um… He got a number he said this number here some um… (untranscribable) this is the number you can contact um… Neil on.

Q: Yeah and that’s he gave you that number.

A: Yeah

Q: Did you have the number prior to that?

A: No.

Q: You were totally unaware

A: Couldn’t remember it

Q: You had never contacted that number before?

A: No.

Q: The first time you got it was from Terry.

A: Yeah”.


	
	The first question in this sequence introduced the proposition that Oti had been asked by someone to give evidence that he had contacted the appellant through the paging service. This was a gratuitous suggestion which Oti adopted. His adoption of it is of little weight. It is not clear that he understood the question or his answer to it as involving the proposition that he was requested by police to fabricate this part of his evidence – as opposed to being asked to give evidence of it in court, having first volunteered the information truthfully out of court.
	
	
	Further questions “Did you have the number prior to that?” and “You were totally unaware” and “The first time you got it was from Terry” were put in disregard of the answer that Oti had given on the previous page. Namely, that the number of the paging service had been provided to him by either George or Sam, as the contact for the appellant.
	
	
	Having led Oti into this inherent contradiction in his evidence, the questioner continued to procure contradictions with more leading, as follows (at 44):
	


“Q: Obviously the first time you spoke to Venchirautti (sic) was after you had been sentenced.

A: Yes.

Q: And he supplied that number for you.

A: Yes

Q: Ok. Were you ever given that number by either George or Sam?

A: mmm They gave me a number but I can’t recall what the number page number or telephone number.”


	
	The record of interview concluded on pp 44 – 46 with Oti being asked to reconfirm those parts of his handwritten statement in which he had said that he was no longer afraid of receiving a longer sentence and was therefore now telling the truth. A very improbable answer was given to a question on the last page of the interview as follows:
	


“Q: When you told the lies about Neil, did you except (sic) that he would be convicted on your evidence?

A: I didn’t expect that he would be convicted. No.”

Oti’s television interview, 25 March 1997


	
	The appellant tendered in the appeal a DVD recording an interview conducted with Oti by Mr Mark Llewellyn, the presenter of a television programme entitled “Witness”. Portions of this interview were extracted by the television producers and incorporated into a programme which was broadcast in 1997. The programme also included exchanges between Mr Llewellyn and the appellant, the appellant’s wife Mrs Cassandra Chidiac and his trial counsel, Mr McCrudden. The appellant tendered transcripts of the entire interview with Oti and of the programme.
	
	
	No direct evidence was led or tendered on the appeal to explain how the producers of this programme were introduced to the subject of the appellant’s conviction and of Oti’s recantation. The programme commenced with the film crew and Mr Llewellyn standing outside the gates of Berrima Correctional Centre in February 1997 in company with Mrs Chidiac and Mr McCrudden. During the recorded programme Mrs Chidiac is described as having been a family friend of the appellant at the time of his trial who watched it throughout and who subsequently “worked tirelessly to clear his name”. In her own words, spoken during the programme, she fell in love with the appellant and married him whilst he was serving his sentence. We infer that Mrs Chidiac must have invited the television producers to make the programme.
	
	
	The only information regarding how Oti was contacted in order to conduct the interview is contained in the programme itself. Mr Llewellyn said:
	


“‘Witness’ went to the Solomon Islands in search of the main (sic) who knows whether Neil Chidiac was framed or not, the man whose evidence got Chidiac a 20-year sentence, Alfred Oti. After he’d testified against Neil Chidiac, Alfred Oti got early release from gaol and returned to Honiara. We found him where he is every Sunday, in church. He’s been off the grog for ten years now. He’s become a Christian and is deeply religious. He’s also a man troubled by his conscience.”


	
	The full interview of Oti by Mr Llewellyn is highly repetitive. The following is a summary of the significant parts arranged in order of the chronology of the events described with the numbering of the question to which the answers were given indicated in the brackets.
	
	
	Oti said he had been involved for some time in importing drugs from Honiara into Australia with George and Sam Helais when he received calls from George to say, first, that Sam was coming to Honiara and, later, that Neil was coming (Q 22 – 23). The appellant arrived in Honiara, Oti met him but they did not on that or on any other occasion speak about drugs (Q 24 – 26).
	
	
	Oti stated that Wilson Kwalu physically met the appellant at his hotel in Honiara in May 1985 and was present when Oti and the appellant spoke on that occasion, being Oti’s second meeting with the appellant. Drugs were not discussed (Q 66 – 76).
	
	
	Oti said he met Detective Venchiarutti when he came to the prison where Oti was serving his sentence for the December 1985 importation:
	


“…and asked to see me and he told me that they knew about an importation that I was involved in, including Neil, and that they would be coming back to me for further interview and statement – taking a statement down” (Q 19).

Detective Venchiarutti “just turned up” at the gaol when he asked Oti about giving evidence and “[h]e said that, at a later date, someone else would come up and get statement from him” (Q 156 – 161).


	
	Oti said Detective Venchiarutti told him that police:
	


“had been trying to implicate Neil on some drug importations and then, because of Neil’s… name being mentioned by George… I thought that… it was true, but to my knowledge – my knowledge personally, I – I didn’t know that he was involved in drugs” (Q 29).


	
	Oti said he was told by Detective Venchiarutti and other police that he would be a long time in gaol but if he helped them by giving evidence against the appellant he would “get out very quickly” as “we have been trying to get him”. Oti made up a story about the appellant to try “to get myself out of gaol quickly” (Q 32 – 34, 44 – 45, 167 – 168).
	
	
	Oti gave the following answers, to the effect that police interviewing him had provided cues for the story they wanted him to fabricate:
	


“Q 37. Did you decide to make up that story or were you told to make up that story?

A No, I – I – there was some questions that sort of led me to say things that I just have to tell during that conversation – interview.

Q 38. What questions?

A No, I mean, sort of, like the way they questioned me gave me some ideas to – what to say.

…

Q 46. And you spoke about questions that led you to realise what they wanted. What sort of questions were asked of you?

A Oh, I can’t remember exactly now.

Q 47. But you got that impression?

A Yes.”


	
	Oti gave these answers:
	


“Q 95. …You say here in the statement [referring to the handwritten statement of 23 November 1994], ‘They told me to make statements against Neil’. Did they? What did they say?

A They told me to say things that would implicate Neil and – but they did not mention what to say. They just told me that – that I had – for me to say something that – that would implicate him that would help them to arrest him.

Q 96. How did they put that?

A Well, they [Detective Venchiarutti and another officer] said, ‘We have been trying to get him for a long time, and whatever you say now will… help us to get him’.”


	
	Oti asserted that he was not asked to make up the account that gave or any particular account – and that he invented his evidence on his own.
	


“Q 173. Did they tell you to make up the story about the Solomon Islands?

A No, they told me to say what happened when Neil came over here.

Q 174. But nothing happened? There was no - - -

A No.

Q 175. - - - talk.

A No.

Q 176. So how did the story happen that you said Neil came to talk about drugs?

A I just made it up. I just connected all those things, like George rang me up and the coppers were going after Neil, so I started making the story up.”


	
	Oti repeated that what he now claimed were lies told to police to incriminate the appellant had been invented unaided.
	


“Q 261. …[C]an you recall… what the police actually said to you to indicate that they knew that Neil had visited you in Honiara?

A Yeah, they – they said, ‘Neil had been to Honiara to see you so what did he… come over for?’

Q 262. And what did you say when they asked that?

A …I started saying that we talked about drugs and this and how to import drugs.

Q 263. That was lies?

A That was a lie, yes.

Q 264. Did someone tell you to say that?…

A Mm.

Q 265. Did you make it up all on your own?

A I just made it up… on my own.”


	
	Oti gave answers to the effect that when police asked him what had taken place between him and the appellant upon the latter’s visit to Honiara in May 1985 he had initially told them that the appellant was merely on a holiday, before changing his story to implicate the appellant with a view to obtaining assistance for his early release from prison:
	


“Q 273. …Did they say that Neil had been here before and they knew that?…

A Yeah, they told me that Neil had been here before and that I had met him here and they wanted to know what we were discussing here then.

Q 274. Did you tell them at that stage that Neil had come on a holiday?

A I told them that Neil was there on holiday with his wife and children.

…

Q 277. When was drugs mentioned? What happened then? Was there mention of drugs by you or - - -

…

Q 278. - - - Was there mention of drugs by the police?

A - - - by the police. They said, ‘Do you know that Neil was involved in drugs?’ I said, ‘No’, and they said ‘Do… you know that it’s the importation that you and Wilson were involved in? Was Neil in that, or Neil was involved also?’ I said, ‘No, I didn’t know that’.

…

Q 281. What happened next?

A And this, as we went on, then I started switching over again and I said, ‘Well, we talked – discussed about drugs’.

Q 282. Why did you switch over?...

A I was thinking of my own sins that I would get less and if I give… that evidence to support… they were then trying to get Neil. So I thought if… Neil, you know, got arrested, then I would be released, yeah, earlier…

Q 283. But you’d already told them that Neil wasn’t involved; you’d said there was no talk of drugs?

A At first I told them there was no involvement, that Neil was not involved and he was on a holiday.

Q 284. And then they told you what?

A They… asked me, ‘Do you know that he was involved in drugs?’ I said, ‘No’.

…

Q 286. And then they said what?

A ‘And do you know that he was involved in this particular importation that you and Wilson were involved in?’ I said ‘No’.

…

Q 288. And what happened next?

A And they said, ‘Well, you now know that he was involved and he was the… boss’, sort of, yeah. ‘He was the boss behind the whole importation’. And I thought it was [George] and I… didn’t know that Neil was involved in drugs.

Q 289. Who said that to you?...

A Terry Venturutti (sic).

…

Q 296. You now told them that Neil came to talk about drugs?

A Yes, because they said, ‘You… had better tell the truth’. They… seemed not to believe what I said first so they kept pressurising me to tell lies as a truth… so to speak. So I told lies and they believed it and they said that was the truth.”


	
	Oti said police already knew that the appellant had visited Honiara in May 1985, when they came to interview Oti in prison. Oti stated his suspicion that they had gained this knowledge from George. He said George knew of the visit because he was the person who had informed Oti, first, that Sam Helais was coming to the Solomon Islands and, subsequently, that the appellant was coming in his place (Q 247 – 253).
	
	
	Oti claimed to have believed George would also have told police about the involvement of Kwalu in the importations during 1984 and 1985 because they asked him “Is Wilson involved?”. Oti said that when he told them Kwalu was involved the police asked him to include Wilson in the story about Neil Chidiac (Q 192 – 196).
	
	
	Oti said George had provided him with the number of the Voice Call paging service at the time of advising that “Neil” would visit Honiara in place of Sam. George had said “When Neil returned (scil. returns), this is the number you can contact” (A 308). Two questions further on Oti contradicted this and said that this conversation took place after the appellant had visited. Then at A 316 he said that it was George who told him “When you ring the pager service, ask for Neil and say, ‘This is Alf’.” (Q 306 – 320).
	
	
	Oti asserted that Kwalu knew to tell police the same fabricated story that Oti had told, incriminating the appellant, because Oti wrote him a letter from prison telling him “to say that we met Neil here and discussed something about drugs and that when he went over to Sydney that he met Neil” (A 54). Detective Venchiarutti did not tell Oti what to write in this letter and Oti did not tell the detective what he had written. Oti did not see the detective read the letter but suspected that he did. Oti gave the letter to Detective Venchiarutti who delivered it to Kwalu in Honiara (Q 49 – 65, 198 – 201). At Q 223 – 228 Oti claimed the letter had been opened before it was delivered to Kwalu and that he suspected Detective Venchiarutti had done this and therefore knew that Oti had coached Kwalu.
	
	
	Oti said the Crown prosecutor had conferred with him about differences between his first statement to police and Kwalu’s statement concerning the reason for Kwalu’s November 1984 trip to Sydney (see [28]). Prosecuting counsel and others “visited me to… tell me that my evidence, the statement that I gave against Neil, was not in line with the evidence that Wilson gave… [prosecuting counsel] said I had to change mine, some of the things to… go in line with Wilson’s statement” (A 361, 363). After this discussion with Crown counsel “the coppers came up bringing that statement, Wilson’s statement. …I looked at it. …I did not actually change the first [statement] but [I made] an additional statement” (A 377 – 379).
	
	
	Oti claimed that Detective Venchiarutti instructed him not to send his letter to Kwalu “through proper channels” of Corrective Services and the post. “He told me not to send it; …[he] would come and pick it up and bring it over [to Honiara] himself”. Oti asserted that Detective Venchiarutti “smuggled the letter out”, contrary to prison regulations (Q 239 – 245).
	
	
	Oti said he did not expect the appellant to go to jail and was surprised at his arrest:
	


“A8… [W]hen I heard that Neil was arrested I got a shock. I wasn’t prepared. …I didn’t realise that my statements or whatever… I said against Neil would be that strong. Then, …from that time, I realised that he… was implicated and my… statements did this and that he then ended up in jail and I was very sad to see – to hear… about him.” (Q 8; see also Q 106).


	
	Oti claimed to have been hoping, notwithstanding the provision of his evidence, that the appellant would not go to jail (Q 344 – 357). “I did not expect him to be found guilty” (A 348).
	
	
	Oti said he had written to Mr Dursun while both were in prison, after Oti had given evidence against the appellant. He could not remember everything he said in the letter but it had included that he had not intended “to send anybody to prison” (Q 336 – 343).
	
	
	Oti said he became a Christian when he left gaol, was “a committed Christian” at the time of the interview for the television programme in 1997 and was sorry for having given false evidence against the appellant (Q 82).
	


Innuendo against Detective Venchiarutti in the television interview


	
	The television interviewer’s manner of questioning conveys implicit assertions of improper conduct, in two respects, of the police officers who were in 1987 and early 1988 investigating the appellant’s possible involvement in drug importation. These assertions appear to the Court misconceived and unfounded. The first is that police improperly pressured or induced Oti by telling him, prior to the making of his statement on 17 October 1987, that he would spend a long time in prison if he did not co-operate with police by giving evidence against the appellant.
	
	
	Detective Venchiarutti does not dispute that this is what Oti was told. It did not amount to improper influence or inducement. When he made his first statement Oti still had 8 years and 2 months of his effective non-parole period to serve under the sentence imposed in the District Court on 3 April 1987. He would be eligible for parole on 22 December 1995. He would have had very good prospects of obtaining significant reduction in that sentence if he co-operated with authorities, especially if his doing so enabled police to charge another offender whom they would not have been able to bring to justice without his help.
	
	
	Oti’s sentence was significantly reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Oti (1990) 19 NSWLR 561. From the reasons of this Court published at that time it appears the reduction came from the application of amended sentencing legislation in New South Wales and from the interaction of the amended provisions with the relevant Commonwealth statute. The reasons make no reference to a reduction for assistance to authorities. The result was the reduction of his original sentence to 5 years and 6 months commencing 23 December 1985 and expiring 22 June 1991 with an additional term (during which he might be released on parole) of 1 year and 10 months.
	
	
	For the reasons stated at [55], no impropriety is involved in informing a prisoner that he may obtain reduction of sentence, either prior to first sentencing or by the introduction of fresh evidence on an appeal, by assisting authorities. Impropriety would be involved only if the prisoner was encouraged to give false evidence. That is the subject of some of Oti’s answers given during the interview, contradictions in which and the unreliability of which will be considered hereunder.
	
	
	A second theme of the television interviewer’s innuendo was that the police officers’ lack of interest in the incriminating information which Oti offered regarding George reflected deliberate targeting of the appellant and favourable treatment of a co-conspirator. In view of George’s evident status as a police informant, the investigating officers’ lack of interest in evidence from Oti concerning him is understandable. In accordance with usual and legitimate operational decision making it would not be expected that George should be charged.
	


Appellant’s evidence in the appeal relative to obtaining Oti’s recantations


	
	An affidavit of the appellant sworn 31 May 2013 was read on the hearing of the appeal. He gave short supplementary oral evidence-in-chief to the effect that he did not discuss drugs with Oti when they met in Honiara and that he had never met Kwalu before seeing him at his trial in February 1989. Significant parts of the cross-examination of the appellant will be referred to later in these reasons. At this point reference will be made only to those passages which bear upon the circumstances of Oti having offered his recantations in November 1994 and March 1997.
	
	
	In evidence-in-chief the appellant made no mention of a letter having been written by Oti to Mr Dursun and shown by Mr Dursun to the appellant whilst the two of them were in custody in Parklea prison. Nor is there any account given by the appellant of the circumstances which led to Mr Jameson and Mr Dursun travelling to Honiara in November 1994 to obtain Oti’s handwritten statement and to interview him or of the circumstances which led to the television interview of Oti in March 1997.
	
	
	In cross-examination before this Court (T 55 – 56) the appellant said Oti had sent a letter to Mr Dursun “apologising for what he did to me as the police are concerned” and stating “the police made him do that”. According to the appellant this had occurred whilst all of them were in jail. Mr Dursun had shown the letter to the appellant when those two were at Parklea in “89/90” but the appellant did not obtain a copy. He understood the letter as “implicating the Federal Police – by twisting [Oti’s] arm as such – to say what he said”. The appellant said he engaged Mr Jameson “to get a statement from Mr Dursun about this matter” (T 55.47). He did not say when that engagement was made. He said that on release from prison in February 1997 he engaged Mr Jameson to go to Honiara to see Oti.
	
	
	The appellant gave these answers (T 57.15 – .23, .32 – .38):
	


“T 57.15 Q. Did you give him any specific instructions about what he should say to Oti or ask him about?

A. No.

Q. Did you provide him with any documents?

A. No, we were talking about the letter, and [Mr Jameson] went to Honiara to ask him - there was doubts what the Federal Police did to clear the whole matter, and that’s why he went to Honiara and took Durak Dursan (sic) with him because he’s the one who knows Oti.

…

T 57.32 Q. Did you convey to Mr Jameson your belief that you’d been wrongly convicted?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you ask him to obtain information from Mr Oti that would support that wrongful conviction?

A. I asked him to get the truth from Oti concerning the wrongful conviction.”


	
	The appellant further said that he did not pay Mr Jameson, even for his travel expenses. He did not instruct Mr Jameson to have Mr Dursun accompany him to Honiara. He understood that Mr Dursun was a friend of Oti’s and that he had offered to go. The appellant did not meet with or speak to Mr Dursun before they departed for Honiara. The appellant denied that he had sent Mr Dursun for the purpose of intimidating Oti.
	


Oti’s recantations are not in evidence in the appeal by force of the reference


	
	When the hearing of this appeal commenced on 28 August 2015 the appellant submitted that he was entitled to rely upon all of the material which had been received by Beech-Jones J on the application under s 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act (see [2]). This included the recantations of Oti from November 1994 and March 1997, in handwriting and in transcript and video recorded interviews.
	
	
	The application to Beech-Jones J had been determined on the papers. In accordance with s 79(4) the Crown was permitted to make submissions. It did not object to his Honour taking into account the “previous representations” of Oti in unsworn written form. In this appeal the appellant submitted that that material “went in properly, bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings” and had become “part of the case” as presented to Beech-Jones J. It was argued that when the order was made to “refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal,” as provided for in s 79(1)(b), the result was that everything that had been before Beech-Jones J was to be regarded as being in evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	In this connection the appellant cited the judgment of Gaudron and Toohey JJ in Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 311 – 312. That case was concerned with s 140 Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) by which power was conferred upon the Attorney-General of Western Australia to refer a petition in relation to an offender to the Court of Criminal Appeal of that State for “the whole case to be heard and determined as if it were an appeal by the offender against the conviction”. The full passage from their Honours’ judgment was as follows:
	


“[63] Prima facie, the reference of the whole case required the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider the case in its entirety, subject only to the limitation that it ‘be heard and determined ... as in the case of an appeal by a person convicted’. That limitation necessitates that the matter be determined by ‘legal principles appropriate to an appeal’: Ratten, per Barwick C.J. at p 514. See also R. v. Gunn [No.1] (1942) 43 SR(NSW) 23, per Jordan C.J. at p 25, and Allen, Allen and Winter (1910) 5 Crim App R 225, at p 226.

[64] It has been held that, where the whole case is referred, the court may consider matters not relied upon in the petition (R. v. Gunn (No.2) (1942) 43 SR(NSW) 27, at p 31) and matters not specified in the reference (Reg. v. Chard (1984) AC 279). On the other hand, it has been said that, as a matter of practice, the considerations may be confined to those in the petition or the reference. See Re Matthews and Ford [1973] VicRp 18; (1973) VR 199, at p 201; Chard, at pp 292-293. And in Gunn [No.2] Jordan C.J. stated (at p 29):

‘In a case in which there has already been an appeal which has been disposed of on the merits ...the Court, in the case of a reference such as the present, is not called upon to re-adjudicate upon any ground of appeal which has been already heard and disposed of, unless some new matter has come to light which makes a reconsideration of the ground necessary or desirable.’

[65] The words of s. 21(a) of the Code, so far as they require ‘the whole case ... (to) be heard and determined’, permit of only one meaning. It is the whole case which must be passed upon by the application of legal principles appropriate to criminal appeals. That being so, the power to exclude matters from consideration is properly to be seen as an aspect of the inherent power of a court to control its own proceedings. That power will authorize the exclusion of issues which are frivolous or vexatious: see Jackson v. Sterling Industries Ltd. [1987] HCA 23; (1987) 162 CLR 612; Tringali v. Stewardson Stubbs & Collett Ltd. (1966) 66 SR (NSW) 335; Metropolitan Bank v. Pooley (1885) 10 App Cas 210. However, subject to an issue being properly excluded as frivolous or vexatious, it is, in our view, the duty of a court to which there has been a reference of the whole case to pronounce upon the whole case as presented.”


	
	We do not consider that this passage supports the appellant’s contentions as paraphrased at [128] at all. We have earlier quoted (at [10] and [11]), from the judgment of Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Mallard v The Queen, their Honours’ statement that “the words ‘the whole case’ embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether ‘new’, ‘fresh’ or ‘previously adduced’, in the case against, and the case for, the appellant” (emphasis added).
	
	
	Section 79(1)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act employs language closely similar to s 140 Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) and the purposes of the two provisions respectively are substantially the same. We consider that “the whole case” in s 79(1)(b) is limited to “the whole of the evidence properly admissible” just as the High Court found the same expression to be so limited in the statute considered in Mallard v The Queen. This is further confirmed by consideration of s 86 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act (quoted at [12]).
	
	
	If the appellant had brought this appeal directly under the Criminal Appeal Act rather than by reference, the reception of new or fresh evidence would be limited to that which would be admissible. We reject the proposition that everything which was before the judge who ordered the reference is part of “the whole case” irrespective of its admissibility according to the rules of evidence applicable in the appeal.
	
	
	The appellant’s trial was conducted before the enactment of the Evidence Act 1995. Whether that Act or the pre-existing common law governs the admissibility of Oti’s recantations in this appeal is a question which may be answered by analogy with the rule which would apply in a conventional appeal concerning new or fresh evidence. The general principles governing appeals of that nature have been restated in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at [63].
	
	
	The choice of the applicable evidentiary rule is readily resolved by reference to two considerations. First, the recantations are “fresh” evidence in that this material did not exist at the date of trial and was not available to be adduced by the appellant however diligently his legal representatives may have prepared his defence. Evidence which has emerged subsequently has no natural connection with the date of the trial such as would justify adopting that date for the ascertainment of the applicable rule of admissibility. It would be incongruous now to apply a rule of evidence which operated at the date of trial to material which surfaced later, if the law had altered in the meantime – as it has.
	
	
	Secondly, in an appeal such as the present, where the only relief sought is the quashing of the conviction and the substitution of acquittal, this Court is asked to make its own finding of whether the verdict is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” upon “the whole case”. This should be decided upon evidence admissible at the time the finding is to be made according to evidentiary rules then in force. This is not an appeal where the soundness of the jury’s verdict is to be considered upon the limited basis of the material tendered at trial plus any additional evidence which was reasonably admissible at the time of the trial and could have been tendered therein. If that were the issue, logic would suggest that rules of evidence applicable at the date of trial would also be applicable in the appeal.
	
	
	It follows that the rule of evidence to be applied must be s 65(2) of the Evidence Act which is in force at the time of the appeal before this Court and which governs the reception of material for the making of a decision now. This accords with the view taken by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Rich v R [2014] VSCA 126; (2014) 43 VR 558 at [132] – [135]:
	


“[132] In order that new evidence may be taken into account on appeal, it must be demonstrated that there has been a “miscarriage of justice“. For that purpose, as we have explained, “miscarriage of justice“ is used in two different senses. In the first sense, a miscarriage of justice exists where, on the material before a court of criminal appeal, including any new evidence, it is apparent that the applicant is innocent of the offence of which he has been convicted or if there is such a doubt about his guilt that the conviction should not be allowed to stand. In the second sense, a miscarriage of justice exists where, upon consideration by the court of criminal appeal of so much of any new evidence as qualifies as “fresh evidence“, it is apparent that, if the fresh evidence had been accepted by the jury, it would likely have resulted in a different verdict or that there is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted.

[133] Accordingly, the task of a court of criminal appeal in the first class of case is different to its task in the second. In the first class of case, the court must consider all of the evidence called at trial together with any new evidence (whether or not the new evidence was available to the applicant to be called at trial) and, on that basis, form its own view of the facts; always bearing in mind the facts which were proved at trial. If the court is thereby satisfied of the applicant’s innocence, or entertains such a doubt as to the applicant’s guilt that it considers the verdict should not be allowed to stand, the court will quash the conviction and enter a judgment and verdict of acquittal.

…

[135] In the first class of case, there is no need to inquire into whether the trial was fair or unfair. It may be assumed that it was fair. The question is whether, on the material before the court of criminal appeal, including any new evidence, it appears that the applicant is innocent or that his guilt is in such doubt that he should not stand convicted. Logically, it follows that the admissibility of any new evidence falls to be determined by the court according to the law of evidence as it stands when the matter is before the court.”

Oti is not “available” to give evidence for purposes of s 65 Evidence Act


	
	Unless s 65 Evidence Act applies to the “previous representations” by Oti, s 59 renders them inadmissible. Section 65 provides as follows so far as relevant:
	


“65 Exception: criminal proceedings if maker not available

(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation:

(a) was made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or

(b) was made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or

(c) was made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or

(d) was:

(i) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made, and

(ii) made in circumstances that make it likely that the representation is reliable.

Note. Section 67 imposes notice requirements relating to this subsection.

…

(7) Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:

(a) to damage the person’s reputation, or

(b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or

(c) to show that the person is liable in an action for damages.”


	
	As at 28 October 2015 when the hearing of this appeal commenced the appellant had not located Oti and was therefore not in a position to obtain from him an affidavit verifying his recantations. The appellant was not then able to procure Oti to give evidence orally either by attending Court in Sydney or by means of an audio visual link from Honiara.
	
	
	On 2 February 2016 the appellant filed an amended application seeking a certificate under s 39A Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth). This was with a view to having the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth request the Solomon Islands to arrange for Oti to be examined there. The appellant envisaged that the examination would take place over an audio visual link. On 24 February 2016 the Court ordered that such a certificate should be issued.
	
	
	The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth duly requested the Solomon Islands to make arrangements for Oti to be examined in Honiara. The Solomon Islands Attorney-General complied. A facility for an audio visual link was reserved in Honiara from 2pm (Sydney time) on 8 March 2016 and from 10am on 9 March 2016, being the second and third days of the resumed hearing of the appeal. Mr Oti failed to attend at the location in Honiara where the link was set up at either of these times.
	
	
	In these circumstances the appellant now submits that Oti is “not… available to give evidence” within the meaning of s 65(1). The Court accepts that this pre-requisite for the application of s 65 is satisfied. The appellant has done all that could reasonably have been done to have the witness give sworn testimony, without success.
	


The appeal is a “criminal proceeding” for purposes of s 65 Evidence Act


	
	Section 65 applies if the appeal is to be regarded as a “criminal proceeding”. That expression is defined in Pt 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act, as follows:
	


“criminal proceeding means a prosecution for an offence and includes:

(a) a proceeding for the committal of a person for trial or sentence for an offence, and

(b) a proceeding relating to bail,

but does not include a prosecution for an offence that is a prescribed taxation offence within the meaning of Part III of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) of the Commonwealth.”


	
	A criminal appeal such as the present would not in ordinary legal usage be described as “a prosecution for an offence”. However it is a proceeding which concerns ascertainment of liability for a criminal offence. The question whether this is sufficient to bring the appeal within the meaning of a “criminal proceeding” as used in the Evidence Act is not covered by authority. The words of the definition do not in terms exclude an appeal; they are capable of being read widely enough to embrace this aspect of the criminal process. Interpretation in these circumstances is strongly influenced by consideration of the purpose of the section. It must have been intended by the legislature that the same rules of evidence would apply to evidence first introduced on appeal as would apply at trial. We consider that the expression “criminal proceeding” should be construed sufficiently broadly to embrace the appeal presently before this Court.
	


Recantations “against the interests of” Oti, s 65 Evidence Act


	
	The only possibly applicable part of s 65(2) is paragraph (d). Oti’s representations in his handwritten recantation, in the answers he gave in the record of interview with Mr Jameson and in the television interview were against his interests in that they involved confessions to his having lied on oath at the trial of the appellant. Within the meaning of subs (7) of s 65 such admissions tend to damage Oti’s reputation and to show that he committed an offence against the laws of New South Wales of perverting the course of justice. That leaves the issue of whether the representations were made “in circumstances that make it likely” that they are “reliable”.
	


The range of relevant circumstances in which the recantations were made


	
	In R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386; (2002) 55 NSWLR 603 at [15] – [40] Mason P considered a number of decisions concerning the range of “circumstances” to which regard may be had in applying those paragraphs of subs 65(2) where the likelihood or probability of a person’s representations being either reliable or a fabrication is a threshold question for admissibility. From those decisions his Honour drew conclusions about what circumstances may be considered in deciding whether a previous representation is “unlikely” to be a “fabrication” – the terms employed in par (b) of subs (2). The expression “made in circumstances” is used uniformly in each of pars (b), (c) and (d) of subs (2). The legislature would not have intended any different meaning from one paragraph to the next. Mason P’s conclusions are therefore applicable to par (d). This view is supported by the judgment of Leeming JA (with whom Johnson and Schmidt JJ agreed) in Sio v R [2015] NSWCCA 42 at [27] and by the legislative history of par (d), as traced in that judgment.
	
	
	In R v Ambrosoli at [28] – [29] Mason P accepted that s 65(2)(b) is
	


“directed at the circumstances of the making of the representation. ... But it does not necessarily follow that evidence of events other than those of the making of the previous representation cannot throw light upon the circumstances of the making of that representation and its reliability as affected thereby” (emphasis in original).


	
	At [31] Mason P said that “evidence tending merely to the reliability or otherwise of the asserted fact (usually the ultimate issue at the trial) could not be advanced on the voir dire for or against the admissibility of the evidence of the previous representation”. Putting this another way (at [34]), his Honour held that at the point of determining admissibility under s 65(2) “evidence tending only to prove the asserted fact” should be excluded from the examination of the circumstances in which the previous representation was made.
	
	
	Mason P held at [36] that prior or later statements or conduct of the person making the previous representation may be taken into account on the threshold assessment of likelihood (or otherwise) of reliability but only “to the extent that they touch the reliability of the circumstances of the making of that previous representation. If they do no more than tend to address the asserted fact or ultimate issue they have no bearing on the issues presented by s 65(2)”. His Honour concluded that in the case then before the Court it was relevant for the trial judge to have considered both the manner in which police had interviewed the maker of the witness statement tendered under s 65 and also the evidence of the witness in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination at committal.
	
	
	In addition to being cited with approval in Sio v R, R v Ambrosoli has been applied in this Court, for example in Youkhana v R [2013] NSWCCA 85. On an application for special leave to appeal the decision in Sio v R, heard on 11 March 2016, there was reserved to the full bench of the High Court the question whether leave would be granted in relation to a ground of appeal concerning the construction of s 65(2). The issue in that appeal regarding s 65(2) if it should be entertained by the full bench would concern the need to consider individual answers given in a long interview as to whether they were, severally, given “against interest” in a case where the interviewee attributed blame to a co-accused thereby tending in fact to exculpate the interviewee himself. It is not apparent that issues which may be argued in the High Court in Sio v R concerning s 65(2) would be of significance to the present case, given that all of the statements made by Oti in 1994 and 1997 upon which the appellant wishes to rely were against his interest for the reasons given in [144].
	


Motive for Oti to recant falsely


	
	The purported recantations of November 1994 and March 1997 were not inherently likely to be truthful merely by virtue of the circumstances in which Oti wrote and spoke on those occasions. Having returned to Honiara soon after his release from protective custody on 22 June 1991, Oti was not in a situation of which it could be said that it would be unlikely he would offer a recantation unless it were true. The making of the recantations is equally consistent with him having felt at risk of repercussions from the appellant or his associates. His conduct could be explicable on the basis that he felt pressured by the approach of Messrs Jameson and Dursun in November 1994, whether they intended it or not. He knew that they were speaking with him at the behest of the appellant.
	
	
	In March 1997, only weeks after the appellant had been released from prison, Oti may have continued to feel apprehension about repercussions. When interviewed by the television presenter, he may have additionally felt a need to attempt to maintain consistency with what he had told Messrs Jameson and Dursun two and a half years earlier.
	
	
	Both in November 1994 and March 1997 Oti may have considered that he was not at risk of any further action by authorities against him if he should falsely recant. He had secured his release. Thus, he may have calculated that he could appease the appellant by purporting to recant at no cost to himself in the sense of incurring further attention from authorities.
	
	
	In accordance with the appellant’s request we have viewed the video recording of the March 1997 television interview. The appellant has characterised Oti’s presentation therein as showing “a friendly and open demeanour”, said to be inconsistent with him having felt any pressure or threat from the appellant. The Court’s impression of Oti’s demeanour is that he tended to maintain a fixed smile throughout, whilst purporting to speak of the gravest wrongdoing on his own part. This incongruous manner whilst being questioned by the television presenter does not assist the Court in evaluating the reliability of his representations.
	


Oti’s given reasons for recanting


	
	The circumstances in which the recantations were made include the reasons given by Oti for his change of position. In November 1994 his only purported explanation for a change of moral sense was that he had “been a dedicated Christian since [he] had got out of jail” (see [63](2)). This was in his November 1994 handwritten statement and was repeated by him in the record of interview of that date (see [73]). We accept Detective Venchiarutti’s evidence that Oti stipulated the opportunity to continue with his bible studies as a condition of co-operating with police in late 1987 (see [48](3)). Religious observance was not new to him in 1994.
	
	
	At pp 18 – 19 of the record of interview with Mr Jameson, Oti was challenged about his claim to have adopted a stronger morality since giving evidence at the trial (see [73]). We find Oti’s purported distinction between, on the one hand, being a reformed and dedicated Christian at the time of giving evidence, and, on the other hand, being “born again” at the time of recanting unconvincing. His purported change of moral outlook is left unexplained. His claim that reform from alcoholism had improved his memory, reduced his confusion and contributed to him telling the truth in November 1994 (see [74]) lends no plausibility to the recantations as against his original evidence. When he gave evidence in the appellant’s trial he had been in prison for over 3 years and would have been well and truly free of the effects of alcohol addiction.
	
	
	Similarly in the March 1997 television interview Oti failed to explain the different effect of his Christianity at the time of offering his recantations as opposed to at the time of giving his original evidence. The difference was said to be that in March 1997 he was now a “committed Christian” ([116]). We find in this no explanation at all and nothing to make it likely that his moral outlook was more sound and dependable in March 1997 than at the appellant’s trial.
	


The origins of Oti’s purported willingness to recant


	
	The evidence of how Oti first communicated his willingness to recant is beset with contradictions and improbabilities. In July 1994 Mr Dursun told Mr Tunstall that Oti had written to him in prison a number of letters expressing regret that he had given false evidence (see [57](6)). In oral evidence in this appeal Mr Dursun said there was only one letter ([58], [59]). Oti said that there was only one letter in his record of interview with Mr Jameson in November 1994 ([61], [83]). The appellant’s evidence in the appeal was that there was only one letter. If there was correspondence with Oti in this vein one would expect the recipient, Mr Dursun, to recall whether it was one letter or a series.
	
	
	One would also expect that a letter of this nature, or a copy of it, would have been retained – at least by Mr Dursun, who claims to have had sufficient interest in the appellant to have shown him the letter at Parklea. It would also be expected that the appellant, in the situation he claims to have been in of having been falsely convicted, would have made every endeavour to obtain and keep a copy of the letter. If he could not do this, it would be expected that the appellant would report the contents of the letter he had seen promptly to his legal representatives. However Mr Dursun asserts that the appellant did not consider he needed the letter and returned it to Mr Dursun who tore it up ([59], [67]). Mr Dursun’s evidence to the effect that this letter was shown to the appellant in the second half of 1989 ([60]) is consistent with the appellant’s claim that he saw it in “89/90” ([126]). Yet there is no evidence to suggest that the appellant reported the contents of the letter or took any action to have Oti followed up with respect to it until Mr Jameson was engaged in the first half of 1994 ([69]). The Court finds it inconceivable that if there had ever been such a letter brought to the appellant’s attention in 1989 or 1990, he and those protesting his innocence would have failed to act upon it throughout the ensuing years whilst he continued to serve out his prison term.
	
	
	Thus, the purported recantations include within them what we find to be an unconvincing and unacceptable narrative of how Oti’s willingness to recant was first made known. This is not a matter about which there would be any ambiguity, uncertainty or improbability in the recollections of Messrs Oti, Dursun and Chidiac if Oti had truly, at some point before November 1994, communicated his willingness to give a version of events different from that which he had sworn at the trial.
	


Internal inconsistencies in the recantations


	
	Internal inconsistencies in Oti’s purported recantations and contradictions of aspects of them by objectively established surrounding events are further circumstances making it unlikely that the recantations are reliable. Of great significance in this respect is Kwalu’s corroboration (see [22](1) – (3)) of Oti’s original evidence that the two of them had discussed the importation of drugs into Australia with the appellant in the early evening of 28 May 1985 at the Mendana Hotel in Honiara. Oti’s evidence is summarised at [21](7) and (8). Differences in Oti’s and Kwalu’s respective recollections of the details of what was said with respect to the business of drug importing tend against there having been collaboration regarding the conversation.
	
	
	The difference in recollection of the particulars of the discussion are consistent with an imperfect command of English, especially on the part of Kwalu, and the lapse of time between the single brief meeting which both witnesses attended with the appellant and the date on which they made statements and gave evidence. It was open to the jury to accept that the subject of discussion was the importation of drugs into Australia, in which all three would participate, albeit that the evidence left uncertainty as to what precisely was said on this subject. That is the view that the Court takes of this aspect of the evidence at trial.
	
	
	The manner in which Mr Jameson cross-examined Oti, leading to him floating the possibility that he had collaborated with Kwalu by means of a letter from prison prior to the latter’s statement being taken by police (see [77] – [81]) was calculated to encourage Oti to proffer a rationalisation which had no basis in his actual recollection. As referred to at [81] it was only after protracted and pressing questioning that Oti said, with respect to the conundrum of Kwalu being a corroborator of Oti’s purportedly false evidence, “I now see I think ...” followed by him tentatively suggesting that he could have schooled Kwalu as to what to say, either in a letter or a phone call. The Court gives this explanation no weight having regard to the manner in which it was procured and the hesitation with which it was expressed. The independent corroboration by Kwalu of evidence which Oti claims he fabricated stands as an apparently insurmountable refutation of the claim that Oti simply made up his evidence against the appellant.
	
	
	Kwalu’s statements to police were not tendered in the appeal. According to his evidence in cross-examination by the appellant’s counsel at the trial he made a statement on 19 March 1988 and another one on 29 June 1988. It appears from the trial transcript that in the first statement he explained the purpose of his first trip from Honiara to Sydney in late November 1984 as tourism – just as Oti had done in his statement of October 1987. Kwalu admitted at the trial that this was a piece of collaborative concealment. He had in fact carried drugs in November 1984. He said that in a phone call of about 5 or 10 minutes duration, prior to Kwalu making his first statement, Oti had said that he should “forget about the first trip and start second trip”.
	
	
	In cross-examination at the trial Kwalu said that he had travelled to Australia to give evidence in the committal proceedings with respect to the appellant in June 1988. He had then told the prosecutor of the real nature of his visit to Australia in November 1984. This was made the subject of a supplementary statement dated 29 June 1988. He was questioned about the additional revelation in his second statement when he was examined in the committal on 6 July 1988. It appears that after Kwalu had acknowledged to the prosecution that he had imported drugs into Australia in November 1984, Oti was further questioned and he also admitted this.
	
	
	Kwalu did not in his first statement of 19 March 1988 refer to Oti’s successful drug importation from Honiara to Australia in February 1985. In cross-examination at the trial he said he had been aware of Oti travelling to Australia at that time but he was told by Oti it was a visit in connection with his work as a customs officer. Kwalu said when Oti had returned from Australia he had “greetings from our friends in Australia” but he did not tell Kwalu, even up to the time of Oti giving evidence in the trial, that this had been a drug run. On the basis of that evidence it does not appear that Kwalu collaborated with Oti about concealment of Oti’s February 1985 drug importation. As has been mentioned (at [29]), Oti made no reference to this in his 17 October 1985 statement.
	
	
	In the television interview of March 1997, Oti positively asserted he had coached Kwalu concerning the May 1985 discussion of drug running with the appellant by means of a letter written from prison which he said had been hand delivered to Kwalu by Detective Venchiarutti ([110]). His firm assertion on this occasion is of no weight in light of the way he had tentatively proffered this possible explanation after a strongly leading interrogation, in his record of interview with Mr Jameson in November 1994 (see [72] – [81]).
	
	
	In the March 1997 television interview Oti gave a variety of answers to questions about the manner in which his statement was obtained from him by police, all of them conflicting with each other as to whether police had suggested to him what story he should tell (see [102] – [106]). In his record of interview with Mr Jameson at pp 12 – 15 Oti said police told him they believed the appellant was involved in drug importations and that he, Oti, “came up with the assumption that the appellant was involved” because Sam Helais and George had told him the appellant was coming to Honiara for a holiday. Oti said that he had then “assumed that he was involved with them with drugs importation” and took the “opportunity of the fact that [the appellant] had come [to Honiara] for a holiday visit to tell the police that he was involved” through conversations on that occasion (see [72], referring to pp 12 – 15).
	
	
	In these answers Oti made no suggestion that police already knew, when they interviewed him, of the appellant’s visit to Honiara. He made no suggestion that police had given him any hint of the particulars of the evidence he might give. Similarly in the March 1997 television interview in answer to Q 29 Oti said because the appellant’s name had been mentioned by George he thought, when police informed him that they suspected the appellant’s involvement in the importation, that their suspicions were correct (see [100]). The answer to Q 41 was to the same effect.
	
	
	In answer to Q 37 and Q 38 on 25 March 1997 Oti for the first time asserted that the police had asked him leading questions, hinting what to say to implicate the appellant: see [102]. No such suggestion had been made by Oti in the interview with Mr Jameson in November 1994. This theme of having been led by police as to the content of false allegations which he should make was reiterated in the answers to the other questions quoted and referred to at [102] – [103]. These answers are interspersed with others in which Oti said that police “did not mention what to say”. For example, the passage quoted at [104] – [105], especially the answers to Q 264 and Q 265, where Oti said “I just made it up… on my own”.
	
	
	Yet another variant was Oti’s assertion, in answers to Q 273 – 292 (see [106]), that police had already known that the appellant met with Oti in Honiara and that he had commenced by telling them (truthfully, as he asserted in the March 1997 interview) that the appellant was there for a holiday. In this description of the way police obtained information from him he said that “as we went on, then I started switching over” to an assertion that the meeting had concerned drugs. In answer to Q 296, again, he said “they seemed not to believe what I said first so they kept pressurising me to tell lies as the truth… so I told lies”. This was two-thirds of the way through the interview. Until that point Oti had never suggested that he started out giving police an innocent explanation of the appellant’s visit to Honiara in May 1985 and had only changed to an incriminating account under pressure.
	
	
	Oti’s answers throughout the two interviews concerning the provision to him of the number of the Voice Call paging service exhibit both internal contradictions and a high degree of suggestibility on his behalf. The course of questioning by Mr Jameson is summarised at [87] – [91]. In the television interview two and a half years later, in answer to Q 306 – 320 (see [109]) Oti said George gave him the number of the appellant’s pager at the time of advising him that the appellant would travel to Honiara in place of Sam. Oti said he was at this time told “when Neil returned (scil, returns), this is the number you can contact”. In answer to Q 316 he said it was George rather than the appellant who advised him when ringing the pager service to “ask for Neil and say, ‘this is Alf’”. If, as Oti was asserting in this interview, the appellant did not involve himself in the drug importation conspiracy by the terms of his conversations with Oti in Honiara or otherwise, it would be expected that Oti would have reacted to George giving him the appellant’s pager number and telling him how to make contact by means of it, by asking something to the effect “why will I be wanting to contact the appellant at any time after he has visited Honiara?”
	
	
	Neither in the context of this series of answers nor elsewhere in the interview did Oti state that he had reacted to George’s communication on this subject along those lines. This tends against the credibility of Oti’s assertion that he did not have conversations with the appellant touching the subject of drug importations. His acceptance of the pager number and of instructions how to use it to contact the appellant on an ongoing basis suggests that the appellant did reveal himself to Oti as involved in the importation conspiracy. This is so whether the pager number was provided to Oti by the appellant in Honiara (as he said at the trial) or by George over the telephone (as asserted in this part of the March 1997 television interview).
	
	
	Oti’s suggestibility under leading questions was again illustrated – and exploited by the interviewer – at Q 197 of the television interview. He was asked “Why did you write the letter to Wilson Kwalu?”. The video recording of the interview shows a long pause during which Oti hesitated without answering. Before he could proffer an answer he was prompted with the suggestion that he had been invited to write to Kwalu: “Who asked you to write the letter to Wilson Kwalu?” With the question in this leading form Oti answered promptly “Terry Venturutti (sic)”. Oti went on to say that he “suspected he wanted me to write to tell Wilson what to say, what to tell Terry” and that he did tell Kwalu what to say in the letter which he then prepared.
	
	
	We accept Detective Venchiarutti’s evidence that he did not ask Oti to write to Kwalu with an express or implicit instruction that Oti should in such a letter tell Kwalu what evidence to give. There is nothing in the evidence before us to support an inference or even a suspicion that Detective Venchiarutti acted in such a corrupt manner. He knew that he would not be taking a statement from Kwalu until he had Oti’s statement. This was in fact the order in which things were done. If he had had the intention of causing the two witnesses to collaborate he could readily have achieved this when face to face with Kwalu by leading him in the preparation of Kwalu’s statement, using Oti’s statement of 17 October 1987 as a script. There is no reason to think that a police officer wishing to corrupt the course of justice in the manner asserted by Oti would do so by involving Oti in the process, causing him to bring into existence a written record of the collaboration and entrusting Oti and Kwalu to achieve a collaborative outcome through their own machinations. Oti’s suggestions of dishonest and improper conduct by Detective Venchiarutti in connection with his letter to Kwalu is from every point of view highly improbable.
	
	
	In one part of the March 1997 television interview an attempt was made to lead from Oti evidence which would accord with one of the appellant’s contentions, about which the interviewer and his assistants were evidently briefed. The appellant had said in his dock statement that he had never seen or heard of Kwalu until the committal proceedings ([44](3)). He reiterated this when interviewed by the television presenter for the program (AB 2/251.38). The presenter attempted to obtain Oti’s confirmation of this as follows:
	


“Q 66. …had Wilson Kwalu ever met Neil Chidiac before?

A. Just, yeah – yes.

Q 67. But did he go up and say hello to him or was he just watching him?

A. Well, he didn’t meet him himself but with me.

Q 68. So, sorry, you were watching him?

A. I was in his presence there, I’m sorry.

Q 69. Oh, right, ok. I’m a bit confused. So he didn’t actually physically meet Neil?

A. We did. He did physically meet Neil downstairs.

Q 70. Sorry?

DEB [an assistant to the interviewer, prompting from the sideline in the interview room]: Q 71. Did he speak to Wilson? Did he speak to Wilson?

Llewellyn: Oh, right, I’m sorry. Yeah, I beg your pardon. I got it wrong.

Q 72. Did he speak to Wilson? Did Neil speak to Wilson Kwalu?

A. Actually Neil spoke to me –

Q 73. Yeah.

A. – and Wilson was there.

Q 74. So you came up to Neil –

A. Mm-hmm.

Q 75. – said something to him –

A. Yes.

Q 76. – and that’s all that happened?

A. Yes, the second time.”


	
	Oti’s acquiescence in the proposition put to him in Q 74 – 76 is of no weight. What remains is Oti’s adherence to his recollection that Kwalu did meet the appellant and that a conversation took place between Oti and the appellant in Kwalu’s presence. This is contrary to the appellant’s assertion in his dock statement and his evidence in this appeal.
	


The evidence purportedly retracted was not inherently unbelievable


	
	Oti’s recantations might be more “likely” to be “reliable” if his evidence given at the appellant’s trial, which Oti was purporting to retract, appeared unbelievable, for example by reason of inherent improbability of its substance or by reason of the manner in which it was given. In this respect the appellant relied heavily upon admissions by Oti in the course of his cross-examination that he had lied extensively, including to police officers and on oath (particularly in the Magistrate’s Court). The appellant in particular relied upon this passage of the trial judge’s summing-up:
	


“You as judges of fact have got to decide whether these two self-confessed liars have told the truth or not. What I am bound to tell you is that being accomplices as they are that it is dangerous to convict on their evidence unless it is corroborated. Not only are they accomplices, not only are they down and out villains, not only are they drug smugglers themselves but they are self-confessed perjurers and liars.

I have been sitting on these courts for something like eight years and I have never heard two witnesses so readily admit that they have lied on oath. Now, that does not mean to say that they may not be telling the truth, but what I am saying to you is you will look carefully at what they said before you would hang a dog on their evidence. Really, it is really appalling and you heard it all as much as I did.”


	
	The credibility of Oti’s evidence at trial is a subject which will be returned to later in these reasons when evaluating the totality of the case against the appellant, as presented at trial and when coupled with such additional evidence as may be received in this appeal. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that we have reviewed carefully the protracted cross-examination of Oti. On our analysis the lies to which he admitted were not concerned with the subject matter of his communications with the appellant, which constituted the core of the Crown’s case. He admitted to having lied about collateral matters, such as his “suppression” from his 17 October 1987 statement of the fact that Kwalu’s November 1984 visit to Australia had been to carry drugs. He admitted to having lied by concealing his own first importation from Honiara into Australia in February 1985. These and other matters about which he admitted to having had lied about were collateral to his evidence of the appellant’s adherence to the conspiracy.
	
	
	In cases where it would be open to a jury to find that the accused had told lies it is common for a direction to be given that there may be any of a number of reasons for a person to have told a deliberate untruth and that jurors should not reason that the accused having done so is evidence of guilt of the offence charged: Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234 at [24]. Just as this is regarded in law as a sound direction with respect to lies of the accused, it is sound also to consider whether lies on collateral matters told by an accomplice or co-conspirator may be explicable on some basis other than that the witness lacking credibility on all subjects and that he must have fabricated his account of the central matter upon which he was called by the Crown to testify.
	
	
	Here, it must have been apparent to the jury that Oti had a very obvious reason for telling lies on collateral matters which was nevertheless consistent with him having told the truth regarding the involvement of the appellant. His lies concerned criminal conduct of his relative in-law, Kwalu, in November 1984 and of himself in February 1985. These were matters of which the police otherwise had no knowledge and with which neither Kwalu nor himself had been charged. It would have been open to the jury to conclude that Oti had lied about these matters out of more abundant caution, to save himself from the risk of any further prosecution and perhaps also to avoid any further disgrace to himself for breach of his position of trust as a customs officer. The jury could reasonably have inferred that whilst Oti had such reasons for lying on these matters they were not reasons which would have infected the truthfulness of his assertions about the appellant’s activities in late May 1985.
	


Ground 1 – recantations by Oti and exculpation of the appellant


	
	The Court rejects the tender of Oti’s handwritten recantation dated 23 November 1994, the record of interview of the same date and the television interview of 25 March 1997. For the reasons given at [150] – [180], these previous representations are not “likely” to be “reliable” and do not qualify for reception under s 65. Consequently there is before the Court no evidence of a recantation by Oti with respect to the evidence that he gave at the appellant’s trial and no evidence from him purporting to exculpate the appellant. Ground 1 must therefore be dismissed.
	
	
	The appellant submitted in the alternative that Oti’s recantations should be received in the appeal not under s 65(2) or any other exception to the hearsay rule and not as evidence of their truth but as evidence only of the fact that he made the representations. The Court does not consider that the mere fact of these representations having been made is relevant to whether “on the whole case” it appears that the verdict is “unreasonable or cannot be supported”. It cannot be said that the making of these recantations is consistent only with their having been true and with the evidence of trial having been false. There are other possible explanations, as considered at [179] – [180]. Proof of no more than the mere making of these representations, if they are untrue, would prove nothing more than that Oti is erratic and capable of odd behaviour. It would not support or undermine his credibility with respect to the substance of any particular utterance by him, including his evidence at trial.
	


Evidence in the appeal from George


	
	An unsigned statement of George dated 12 November 2003 was tendered when the appeal was first before the Court for hearing on 28 October 2015. It was marked as an exhibit, subject to objection. George was called on 7 March 2016 and did not adopt this statement. The tender is therefore rejected.
	
	
	The subject matter of the unsigned statement was an approach to George by the AFP at some unspecified time, in which George was requested to make a statement to the effect that the appellant was a drug dealer. George’s evidence-in-chief was:
	


“…I told them the same thing, I didn’t know anything about it at all. So they didn’t get anything off me concerning Mr Chidiac because I didn’t know anything about him.”


	
	In cross-examination George said that he had known the appellant in the 1980s, possibly from before 1984, as a bookmaker. He had never spoken to the appellant. He had been “asked a few time (sic) to make a statement about Chidiac but I didn’t. …I have no knowledge of Chidiac, why should I make any statement”.
	
	
	George said that he had met Oti “in 1980 or 81, I’m not sure”. He gave this evidence about the circumstances of the meeting:
	


“T 15.6 Q. What was the context in which you met him?

A. A friend of mine lost two suitcases between Port Moresby and Solomon Island, I went looking for them.

Q. Who was your friend?

A. Someone.

Q. Do you recall his or her name?

A. Well it’s nothing to do with this case. Sorry, no.

Q. Tell the Court what the name of that person who lost the suitcases was?

A. I can’t remember.

Q. Do you know whether the suitcases contained drugs?

A. It’s nothing to do with this case your Honour.”


	
	George’s evasions and refusals to answer were at this point overcome by direction of the Court to answer, on the basis that a certificate would be issued under s 128 of the Evidence Act so that any answer he might give could not be used against him in subsequent proceedings. This resulted in him giving the following answer
	


“T 15.44: I was looking for two suitcases belong to someone who lost them. There were drugs in them and I got caught in them in Port Moresby and I served time in them. I got caught myself and served time in Port Moresby, 17 months. But when I was looking for them, that’s when I met Oti.”


	
	When asked if Kwalu had been involved in trying to locate the two suitcases in Honiara in about 1980, George initially said no but then said he could not remember. He said that he believed the suitcases had contained hashish and had come from Lebanon. After serving the term of imprisonment referred to in his answer quoted in the preceding paragraph, George had returned to Australia where he was imprisoned for an offence committed prior to his travels in the Pacific region.
	
	
	George claimed that from Long Bay prison he telephoned Oti on an occasion which, from his own chronology, must have been before 1984. He said that he told Oti he was in jail and consequently
	


“I can’t do anything… like I’m no good any more. I’m giving your number to someone if you want to continue what you want to do, you know, like you can do businesses with someone else.

Q. What was the business?

A. I don’t know what business, whatever business he want to do you know like-

Q. Did you believe at the time it was drug dealing?

A. Well I can’t say what.

Q. Did you believe it was drug importation into Australia?

A. I can’t say.”


	
	Later George said the person to whom he gave Oti’s phone number, due to his own incapacity to continue dealings, was “a person named Sam” whose surname he did not know but who did “the bookwork for Mr Chidiac” (T 23). Sam was at this time in Long Bay prison together with George. George said the only reason he gave Oti’s number to Sam was because Sam asked for it. He denied that this was for the purpose of Sam contacting Oti to effect drug importations. George said:
	


“I gave him [Oti’s] number so in case Sam wanted to talk to him and you know, have a friendship with him, whatever, for whatever reason.”


	
	The Court finds George not a credible witness and his evidence wholly unsatisfactory and unreliable for reasons which are illustrated by the passages quoted and summarised thus far. George evaded questions which he did not wish to answer, at times by purporting not to remember. Implausibly he asserted that, at a date before 1984, he had declined any further involvement in activities with Oti because of his own incarceration and criminal record but then denied any knowledge of the nature of the activities from which he was withdrawing. His claim to have handed over to Sam the phone number on which Oti could be contacted only because Sam asked for it and without knowing Sam’s purpose beyond that he might wish to befriend a customs officer in Honiara, is absurd. We reject George’s evidence of his phone conversation with Oti from Long Bay prison and his evidence of having handed over contact with Oti to Sam. The Court considers that the improbability of these answers reflects adversely upon the credibility of everything else that George said on oath in the appeal.
	
	
	George denied that he had asked Oti in 1984 to assist with the importation of drugs into Australia from Malaysia via the Solomon Islands. In support of this denial he claimed to have been present with police when they intercepted a telephone call to Oti concerning the appellant’s visit to Honiara in May 1985. George said he heard the caller falsely identifying himself as “George”, in a voice which was not his own and which plainly was not spoken by him as he was sitting with police listening to the call as it took place.
	
	
	The Court is satisfied that there was no such event. There was no evidence that police were intercepting telephone calls from George or calls to Oti at the time when the appellant’s May 1985 visit to Honiara was being arranged. There is a strong positive inference that police were not intercepting such telephone calls at that time. Evidence of intercepts would have been adduced in the trial of the appellant if they had taken place. It is apparent on all of the evidence before us that police were not even investigating the activities of Oti in May 1985. They did not arrest him until 23 December 1985. In conflict with George’s evidence about his declarations to police of innocence and non-involvement in 1985 there stands the evidence of Durak Dursun that George was, in 1985, actively engaged in drug importing whilst being a police informant (see [57](1)).
	
	
	Even if police were in May 1985 intercepting a telephone service upon which a call might have been made to Oti, it is improbable in the extreme that George would have happened to be present with police when an incriminating conspiratorial call was intercepted and could have been listened to, live. Later in his evidence George contradicted this account by saying that he listened to recorded telephone calls played back to him and that he did not know what the calls were about (T 21 – 22).
	
	
	George further claimed that in about 1984 police had questioned him as to whether he was involved with the appellant in drug importation. He said that at the invitation of police he made a call from their office, in their presence, to Oti “and tell him that you are not dealing with George. I am George but you are dealing not with George. You are dealing with Sam…”. George claimed that he “did tell the Federal Police about Oti that, yeah, he’s a Custom, and he might be involved in a drug smuggling operation, yeah”. He said that he passed this information on at about the time when he had given Oti’s number to Sam and when his name had been used, without his knowledge, in a telephone call to Oti. That is, he was asserting that this occurred in about 1984.
	
	
	If such information had been provided to Australian Federal Police it is inconceivable that they would have acquiesced in George telephoning Oti, in their presence, to assert that his name was being misused by some other person who was in communication with Oti making arrangements for the appellant to travel to Honiara. Possessed of such information about Oti it would be expected that the AFP would make all reasonable endeavours to prevent such a communication by George to Oti, whilst they investigated his assertions. A phone call to Oti such as George asserts would have compromised an investigation fatally. This aspect of George’s evidence is adversely affected both by its inherent improbability and by George’s general lack of credibility.
	
	
	The appellant sought to rely upon George’s evidence before us for his statements, quoted at [184] – [185], that he had no knowledge of the appellant and for his further answers in cross-examination (at T 25 – 28) that he knew nothing of any involvement of the appellant in drug importation, that he had not telephoned Oti in about May 1985 to arrange for the appellant to meet Oti in Honiara and that he was not himself involved in organising two drug importations, with Oti, prior to May 1985. The Court is unable to place any weight upon George’s denials in these respects.
	


Ground 2 – asserted post-trial exculpation by George; evidence of Alan Taciak


	
	George’s testimony in this Court has been received and is to be taken together with all of the evidence given at the trial and any other new or fresh evidence received on the appeal for the purpose of determining whether a verdict of guilty on the basis of “the whole case” would be unreasonable or could not be supported. It is the Court’s view that George’s evidence in the appeal is so lacking in credibility and reliability that it may be discounted entirely in this assessment.
	
	
	Ground 2 asserts that George’s purported exculpatory evidence is “corroborated by a former officer of the Australian Federal Police”. This is a reference to Alan Taciak from whom an affidavit was read in the appeal and who gave oral evidence. From 1982 to 1986 he was a member of the AFP seconded to the Commonwealth State Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking. In 1986 he returned to the AFP and from late in that year until some date beyond May 1988 he acted as the controller or handler of George. George was, by late 1986, already a registered informant and had been under the control of other AFP officers prior to Mr Taciak assuming the role.
	
	
	Mr Taciak’s contract with the AFP was not renewed from 1995 after a Commission of Inquiry found that he had been guilty of corrupt conduct.
	
	
	The appellant submitted that the following paragraphs of Mr Taciak’s affidavit corroborate what ground 1 refers to as George’s “evidence [in the appeal] exculpating the appellant”:
	


“6. I can recall being directed by the Officer In Charge of the AFP Sydney Drug Targeting unit, Detective Inspector Cliff Foster, to get [George] to give further information against Neil Chidiac which he did. I am aware that [George] received a reward from the AFP for information he supplied in relation to Neil Chidiac.

…

8. In my opinion [George] was prepared to give false information which would continue his ongoing relationship with the AFP and continue to allow him to be paid rewards. I can refer to an Operation where he double crossed the AFP. I’m further of the opinion that as time went by [George] realised he could obtain further reward payments from the AFP by inventing information.

…

10. The information that [George] provided which led to him being relocated… was false.”


	
	The affidavit does not specify what information George “supplied” to the AFP in relation to Neil Chidiac. George’s evidence in this Court is that he had no such information and supplied none. Although the Court is unable to rely upon George’s evidence in any respect, that general rejection of him does not enable us to find, affirmatively, the contrary of his assertions. Of itself it does not enable the Court to find that George supplied information to the AFP or, if so, what information.
	
	
	[SUPPRESSED]
	
	
	At T 105 Mr Taciak’s evidence was that George did “obtain further information against Neil Chidiac”. He could not recall “exactly what the specifics of it were, but it was fairly vague from recollection”. At T 112 Mr Taciak said “I can’t recall him [George] actually ever telling me anything of any significance about Chidiac at all”. Mr Taciak could not recall George ever having provided to himself any specific information about hotels or dates of travel which might have had a bearing upon the case which the Crown ultimately presented against the appellant.
	
	
	[SUPPRESSED]
	
	
	[SUPPRESSED] … the Court is left with no affirmative evidence of what George did in relation to building the police case against the appellant, other than Mr Taciak’s general statement that George obtained “further information against Neil Chidiac” which was “fairly vague” and of which Mr Taciak could not recall “the specifics”. For the appellant the highest that this evidence goes is to support an inference that George provided some intelligence to police which enabled them to obtain evidence admissible against the appellant from other sources. As has already been considered at length (see [39] – [43]), George did not himself give admissible evidence against the appellant at his trial.
	
	
	There is no relevant sense in which information provided by George to police regarding sources other than himself of admissible evidence against the appellant could have been false. This appeal is concerned with the veracity of the evidence which the AFP unearthed and which the Crown presented to the jury. It is concerned with the capacity of that evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the charge which was laid against the appellant. Those questions could not be affected by whether the person who led police to that evidence (if that is what George did) was in any sense untruthful about the intelligence he provided. The appeal turns upon the evidence, not upon the intelligence which led police to it.
	
	
	The appellant was convicted on the evidence of Oti and Kwalu concerning conversations they had with the appellant to which George was not a party. George was never in a position to implicate the appellant regarding those conversations. He is not and never has been in a position to exculpate the appellant with respect to those conversations.
	
	
	Oti gave evidence of phone conversations between himself and George in furtherance of the conspiracy. Kwalu gave evidence of meetings with George in Australia. If such evidence had been contradicted by George or if it were now contradicted that might have a bearing upon Oti’s credibility with respect to the principal face to face conversations he claimed to have had with the appellant in Honiara. However the fresh evidence of George is not in the least credible so far as he denies conspiratorial phone conversations with Oti (see [191] – [196]).
	


Ground 3A – failure of the Crown to call George


	
	Ground 3A is a composite of two propositions. First, that the failure of the Crown to call George deprived the accused of a fair chance of acquittal. Secondly, that the failure to call him “warranted of itself a finding that the appellant’s guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt”. The second proposition is apparently intended to mean that the absence of this witness from the trial had the consequence that the jury’s verdict of guilty was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” within the meaning of s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act and should therefore be set aside.
	
	
	The appellant has attempted to support both propositions by a contention framed in the wording of ground 3A itself that the AFP “at all material times after the arrest of the appellant and until the trial of the appellant” believed George “to be a reliable witness”. That contention is not established as a matter of fact. It does not specify what evidence the AFP thought George could reliably give. The Court infers from the circumstances referred to at [39] – [42] … [SUPPRESSED] … that the AFP never considered what evidence George himself could give and never entertained the notion of him being called as a witness. There is no evidence that the AFP ever formed a view that he could reliably give evidence to any particular effect, relevant to the charge upon which the appellant was tried. Rather, the AFP believed George to be a reliable informant in the sense of a source of intelligence. They considered him so because, in relation to the appellant, he had provided information that had led police to witnesses other than George himself whom police believed were sufficiently credible and could give sufficiently reliable evidence to warrant laying the charge.
	
	
	As to the first proposition under ground 3A that George was clearly a material witness. It was open to the appellant’s counsel to require the Crown to call him at the trial. The discretion and responsibility for deciding whether to call George, including whether to do so in response to a defence request, rested with counsel for the Crown, to be exercised with due regard for fairness toward the accused. As was said in R v Apostolides [1984] HCA 38; (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575:
	


“The trial judge may but is not obliged to question the prosecutor in order to discover the reasons which lead the prosecutor to decline to call a particular person. He is not called upon to adjudicate the sufficiency of those reasons”.


	
	There would be grounds for the Court to set aside the conviction on appeal if the Crown’s decision not to call George, when viewed against the conduct of the trial as a whole, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice: R v Apostolides at 575. In an appeal arising from a reference under s 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act the Court could have regard to the additional evidence in deciding this question although it is difficult to envisage how the additional evidence could bear upon the fairness of the trial in this respect.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, the matters to be considered in determining whether a miscarriage of justice occurred are:
	



	
	what reasons the Crown may have had for deciding not to call George, given that on the face of Oti’s account of events George should have been able to give material evidence;
	
	
	whether it appears to this court that George’s evidence may have assisted the defence and
	
	
	the significance of the appellant’s counsel not having requested the Crown to call George.
	



	
	Regarding (1), commonly a decision not to call such a material witness would be made by the Crown upon an assessment that he would not be a witness of truth. Here the failure to call George could not have been justified upon that basis. It was apparent the Crown had not interviewed him let alone formed an adverse view. The case officer, Detective Sergeant Venchiarutti, also had not spoken to George (AB 2/598). Compare Regina v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279; (1999) 47 NSWLR 450.
	
	
	Nor could the failure to call George have been justified upon the ground that he was a co-conspirator. It was clear that he had not been charged and that he would not be. As he was co-operating with police he was not in any sense aligned in loyalty to the accused in circumstances which might incline him to give false evidence biased against the Crown.
	
	
	It is a clear inference that the reason for the Crown not calling George was to protect information which was the subject of public interest immunity as claimed by the AFP; that is, information as to George’s full identity and status as an informant. The learned trial judge told the jury that the Crown had given no explanation for not calling George (see the passage extracted from the summing up at [230]). That appears to be correct in so far as it refers to evidence and submissions in the trial and the lack of any attempt to articulate to the jury why George was absent. It was material for his Honour to point out the lack of explicit explanation for George not having been called as part of the direction in accordance with Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298. However on appeal this Court may infer an explanation by reference to both the trial transcript and the entire circumstances of the case, for the purpose (different from that of the jury) of discerning whether a miscarriage of justice arose from the Crown’s omission of this witness. The reason for George’s absence, which was not in terms explained to the jury, seems readily apparent to this Court.
	
	
	If the Crown on appeal had invoked the AFP’s immunity claim as a basis for not having called George, that would not, without more, answer the complaint of unfairness through absence of a material witness. The immunity could be insisted upon by the AFP in respect of a material witness only at the expense to the Crown of not being able to prosecute in a fair trial – and therefore at the risk of not being able to hold on to the verdict – if other relevant considerations should lead to a conclusion that the trial was unfair in the absence of George.
	
	
	Regarding matter (2) in [214], we are not satisfied that evidence from George would have assisted the defence either by contradicting the accounts given by Oti and Kwalu or by raising in any other manner a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. The evidence which George has given on the appeal is entirely lacking in credit, for reasons stated at [186] – [197]. The appellant’s written submissions implicitly acknowledge this, yet assert that his absence from the witness box has resulted in wrongful conviction:
	


“What evidence George would have given a trial, and whether his credibility would have survived cross-examination, is only a matter of speculation. But, however it might have unfolded, it must now be accepted that Mr Chidiac lost a fair chance of acquittal on that basis alone.”


	
	The Court accepts the first sentence of this submission but the second sentence does not follow. Uncertainty about what George might have said does not support a finding that any miscarriage of justice occurred by him not being called. Still less does it lead the Court to a conclusion that the verdict is “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” so as to warrant setting aside the verdict outright.
	
	
	As for matter (3) in [214], the Court finds that a deliberate choice was made by the appellant’s counsel not to require that George be called by the Crown. It is an inescapable inference that counsel clearly appreciated George was a police informant (see [39] – [42]).
	
	
	At trial it must have appeared highly unlikely that George would give evidence tending to exculpate the appellant. If, as appeared to be the case, he was co-operating with police then it could be inferred that they knew what he would be able to say about the events giving rise to the charge. If that amounted to exculpation then it would have been a serious abuse of process and breach of the duty of disclosure for the AFP to have held back such material from the Crown and the defence. That such misconduct might have occurred may well have appeared to defence counsel most improbable in the circumstances of this case. If it had occurred it would likely have been discovered by the trial judge on the application for the suppression order.
	
	
	It would have appeared much more probable to defence counsel that if the Crown should be forced to call George he would give evidence supportive of Oti’s account of conspiratorial dealings between those two and would also give evidence of dealings between George, Sam, the appellant and Asfour, who was co-accused with the appellant. Requiring the Crown to call George would therefore have appeared likely to produce the disastrous result of having a third witness, in addition to Oti and Kwalu, give direct evidence of the conspiracy and of the appellant’s adherence to it.
	
	
	It appears from the cases that an appeal may succeed on the ground that a miscarriage of justice was caused by the Crown’s failure to call a material witness notwithstanding that defence counsel did not request the Crown to call that witness, even where the defence knew of his or her existence and knew the substance of the evidence he or she could give. See for example Diehm v Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) [2013] HCA 42; (2013) 203 ALR 42 at [66]. The failure of the accused to request that the Crown call a material witness has not been treated as governed by r 4 Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), requiring a grant of leave to argue such a point on appeal.
	
	
	However the failure of the appellant to request that the Crown call George in the circumstances of this case is a significant factor tending to negate any miscarriage of justice. The facts here bear close analogy to those in Tema v State of Western Australia [2011] WASCA 41; (2011) 206 A Crim R 104. Mr Tema met a police informer named Eddie in Perth Western Australia and was shortly afterwards arrested in his motel room in possession of a large quantity of methylamphetamine. A public interest immunity claim by the Western Australian Commissioner of Police was upheld, at an early stage of the prosecution, in relation to subpoenaed documents relevant to “the informer status [of] or any application for indemnity [by]” Eddie.
	
	
	After a delay of 9 years (during which the accused was at large in breach of his bail) the case came on for trial. During a voir dire examination a police officer stated that Eddie was an authorised undercover officer within the meaning of relevant Western Australian legislation. Defence counsel then appearing had not previously been aware of this. He was granted an adjournment to take instructions, in anticipation (so far as the trial judge was concerned) that he might wish to apply for the trial be aborted. However no such application was made, the trial proceeded and defence counsel did not request the Crown to call Eddie or ask the trial judge to direct that the Crown reconsider its decision that he not be called.
	
	
	In dealing with a ground of appeal that the Crown had failed call a material witness, namely, Eddie, Blaxell JA (with whom Pullin and Buss JJA agreed) said this (with transcript references removed):
	


“[54] The question whether there was a miscarriage of justice should be viewed against the course of the proceedings as a whole including the manner in which Mr Tema conducted his defence. In this regard it is significant that Mr Tema and the senior counsel then representing him were aware at a very early stage of most of the matters now relied upon in support of ground 2 [i.e. the matters summarised in [225] – [226]].

[55] As a result of the preliminary hearing on 4 August 1997 Mr Tema was aware that he had been under police surveillance from the time of his arrival at Perth airport and that that surveillance had continued while he was in the company of Eddie. The police had mounted the surveillance operation as a result of information from Detective Paton. That information was that Mr Tema would be bringing amphetamines into Western Australia and that he would be in the company of Eddie. Detective Paton had also told Detective Kirby of the two motels where Mr Tema might stay. Detective Paton was present when room 12 was searched, and that same night had been in contact with Eddie by telephone.

[56] The obvious inference in these circumstances was that Eddie was a police informant who was acting in that capacity during the surveillance operation. Although Mr Tema and his counsel did not know that Eddie was an authorised undercover officer, it was obvious that his role had been much more than that of a passive police informant. That Mr Tema was alert to this fact was confirmed when his counsel submitted to French DCJ (on 21 June 1999) that there was “a very strong likelihood” that Eddie had brought the drugs into Western Australia. Counsel also referred specifically to the fact that there had been conversations between Paton and Eddie prior to the drugs being found.

[57] Although Eddie was not named on the indictment as a prosecution witness it was always open to Mr Tema to request that he be called. In the event of the prosecution refusing that request, the issue could have been aired with the judge (pursuant to Apostilides proposition 2) on any of the occasions when the matter was before the court during 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. The ruling by French DCJ upholding public interest immunity in respect of Eddie’s status as a police informer did not prevent Mr Tema from taking this course.

[58] By the time of Mr Tema’s trial in 2009 he and his counsel were also well aware that Detective Paton had been convicted of offences involving police corruption in 2003. As shown by his counsel’s opening address, that fact was the main string in the bow of the defence. If this new information about Paton combined with what was known about Eddie necessitated the latter being called as a witness then it was still open for Mr Tema to request that this occur. That option remained available when it also became known that Eddie had been an authorised undercover officer with a criminal record.

[59] In the end, and after all of the matters now relied upon were made known to Mr Tema, the trial was adjourned to allow him to consider his position. That adjournment was specifically for the purpose of enabling Mr Tema to instruct his counsel whether he wanted the trial to continue. In that regard, it was clear from the trial judge’s remarks made before the adjournment that any application to abort the trial would have received serious consideration.

[60] Following that adjournment Mr Tema did not apply to abort the trial. It was entirely a matter between him and his counsel as to why he did not give those instructions, but it may well be that he saw some advantage in the trial proceeding in Eddie’s absence. That would be particularly so if he believed that Eddie’s evidence would potentially strengthen the case against him.

[61] Whatever the reason, Mr Tema effectively elected to proceed with the trial rather than apply for an adjournment with a view to Eddie being called. Mr Tema made that decision upon advice, and with knowledge of all of the circumstances that he now raises in support of ground 2 of his appeal. In my view it necessarily follows that he was not prejudiced in the conduct of his defence and that there was no miscarriage of justice. Ground 2 must fail.”


	
	Similarly to the view taken in Tema v State of Western Australia, we conclude that the choice of the appellant’s counsel not to require the Crown to call George is the dominant consideration in determining whether any miscarriage of justice occurred in the present case. The appellant is bound by his counsel’s conduct of the case: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. In any event, there has not been tendered any evidence to suggest that the appellant did not agree to the course taken by his counsel with respect to George.
	
	
	Here, the appellant’s decision to refrain from requiring that George be called was not only forensically sound, it led to a most favourable outcome. Namely, that the trial judge gave the jury a very strong direction in accordance with Jones v Dunkel.
	
	
	His Honour’s summing-up included this passage (AB 2/721):
	


“Well, then we come to the other person, George. Now, George is known – you don’t know his name because I made an order to suppress it, but we know that Asfour was going out with his sister. We know that the police have had contact with George and we have not seen George. George is not even named in the indictment. He is one of the divers other persons. Now, George is the only one who can give direct evidence implicating Asfour and Chidiac because it is George, according to Oti, if you could believe anything Oti said, who said that Neil is coming. It is George who is said to have been present when Kwalu handed the stuff over in Brisbane.

Now, as judges of fact you have to decide it on the evidence that is given. You cannot speculate upon what a witness may or may not have said if that person had been called, but the law is not stupid and the law is that if there is a witness who, on the face of it, can give evidence relevant to an issue before the jury and he is not called, the party who could have called that witness, that is the party who would say that the evidence would support its contention does not, and there is no explanation given for failing to call that witness, an inference which the jury can draw, does not have to draw but can draw, is that that witness cannot give evidence which supports the proposition put by that party. If I can rephrase that, if a party, in this case – the Crown – on the face of it George could have given evidence identifying Chidiac and Asfour as being part of this agreement, the Crown did not call George, no explanation has been given as to why he has not been called, that is that he might be dead or sick or out of the country or something like that, but no such explanation has been given, then an inference which the jury can draw is if George had been called he could not have given evidence which would implicate Chidiac or Asfour, and you might think that that is just ordinary, straight commonsense.”


	
	The Crown asked for this direction to be withdrawn on the basis that “it would not normally be expected that the Crown would call a co-conspirator to give evidence”. The trial judge refused. His Honour also made remarks to the effect that he suspected he had been “conned” and that his “leg” had been pulled in the application for suppression of the identity of George, given that he was not called as a witness. We do not understand in what respect his Honour suspected that he had been deceived regarding this but it does not appear to be significant to the present appeal. We do not ourselves entertain any such suspicion. If material was shown to his Honour supporting the immunity claim, the suppression orders would have been appropriate whether George was to be called or merely referred to by other witnesses.
	
	
	The failure to call George was not in breach of the prosecutor’s duty to call all material witnesses in circumstances where the Crown had a very good reason for the course it adopted. The Crown would properly be willing to co-operate in the desire of the police to protect George as an informant from exposure to identification through giving evidence. The defence did not request that the witness be called. In those circumstances we doubt that the strong Jones v Dunkel direction should have been given. The observations of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at [6] and of four Justices in Mahmood v State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 1; (2008) 232 CLR 397 at [27] are against the validity of the direction. But accepting a more limited principle concerning the giving of a Jones v Dunkel direction with respect to the presentation of a Crown case (see R v Riscuta and Niga [2003] NSWCCA 6 at [99] – [104] and R v Bolte [2010] SASC 112 at [20] – [23]), the trial judge’s direction in this case does not appear to have been warranted, even as the law stood before Dyers v The Queen. The direction as given was a windfall for the appellant.
	
	
	Another forensic advantage to the accused flowing from his counsel not having requested the Crown to call George was that the Crown committed itself irrevocably. If a request had been received and if George was regarded by the Crown as a witness of truth, in order to ensure a fair trial and a verdict which would be defensible upon appeal, the AFP would have had to waive its public interest immunity claim. It may well have been prepared to do so in order to secure conviction of the appellant and his co-accused. The Crown committed to running the trial without George, which was its preference, in circumstances where the appellant acquiesced in that course.
	
	
	Because the trial judge is not required to adjudicate upon the sufficiency of the prosecutor’s reasons for refraining from calling a witness, controversy about such a decision at trial usually does not lead to the judge ordering a stay on the basis that the trial cannot proceed fairly in the absence of the witness. Incurable unfairness resulting from failure to call a witness, in all the circumstances of the case, is something that generally can only be shown in retrospect on appeal, not in the course of the trial on an application for a stay of proceedings on the indictment.
	
	
	However, where the Crown does not suggest that the relevant witness is untruthful but declines to call the person solely because public interest immunity is claimed in respect of his or her identity or some part of the evidence that might be given, then incurable unfairness may be capable of being identified at trial.
	
	
	There is authority for the proposition that proceedings on indictment may be permanently stayed where material information or a material document is withheld from the accused pursuant to a valid claim for public interest immunity, if the withholding would render a trial upon the charge unfair: Alister v The Queen [1984] HCA 85; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 431 per Murphy J; Gardiner v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [87], [97]; R v Lappas [2001] ACTSC 115.
	
	
	It may be that in an appropriate case the withholding from the accused of a witness, like the withholding of a document, upon a valid claim of public interest immunity would similarly justify a permanent stay. But assuming that to be so, the application for stay at trial would have to have been preceded by a requirement from the accused that the Crown should call the witness. The Court need not consider further the possibility of the proceedings on this indictment having been amenable to a stay, given that the appellant’s counsel made no request for George to be called.
	
	
	So far as ground 3A rests upon the first proposition it fails.
	
	
	With respect to the second proposition in ground 3A (see [210]), absence of a witness in circumstances such as those with respect to George cannot of itself render a guilty verdict “unreasonable, or [such as] cannot be supported”. That basis for setting aside a verdict is to be considered, in a conventional appeal, by reference to the totality of the evidence which was before the jury; in this appeal it is to be considered by reference to the trial evidence plus any additional evidence tendered and properly admissible in this Court. Failure of the Crown to call a witness is a conceptually distinct basis of challenge to a verdict, having to do with the fairness of the trial rather than the capacity of the evidence to prove a charge beyond reasonable doubt. The attempt to conflate the concepts in the drafting of ground 3A is misconceived.
	
	
	The appellant cited the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Kiefel JJ in Mahmood v State of Western Australia at [27] in support of this second proposition:
	


“In the joint reasons in RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [27]-[29] it was pointed out that where a witness, who might have been expected to be called and to give evidence on a matter, is not called by the prosecution, the question is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, they should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. Similar views were expressed by Gaudron and Hayne JJ and by Callinan J in Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 3; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at [13], [120]-[123].”


	
	The purpose for which a jury may use the unexplained absence of a material witness as contributing to a reasonable doubt is unrelated to the determination by a court of criminal appeal of a ground concerning failure to call a witness. Such a ground of appeal goes to whether there has been a miscarriage of justice in the conduct of the trial, a question which is never before a jury. The passage cited from Mahmood v State of Western Australia only confirms that the second proposition in ground 3A is misconceived.
	
	
	We reject ground 3A.
	


Ground 3(a) – fresh evidence from Durak Dursun


	
	Under ground 3(a) the appellant’s argument is that Mr Dursun’s evidence corroborates fresh exculpatory evidence from Oti, being the latter’s recantations of November 1994 and March 1997. This material from Oti has been rejected by the Court and therefore any purported corroboration of it from Mr Dursun is irrelevant and does not form part of “the case as a whole” which the Court is required to consider under s 79 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
	
	
	In any event, Mr Dursun’s evidence does not in the Court’s view corroborate the exculpatory recantations of Oti which the appellant tendered. If it did we would have taken the corroboration into account in determining whether Oti’s “previous representations” were “likely” to be “reliable” in the course of deciding the admissibility of the recantations under s 65(2)(d) Evidence Act. Mr Dursun’s evidence in this Court is summarised at [56] – [61] and [64] – [68]. We have already stated at [61] our finding that what Mr Dursun has said about Oti having written a letter or letters of apology for falsifying his evidence against the appellant contains significant internal contradictions, is inherently improbable and not credible or reliable. Even if Mr Dursun’s evidence were accepted that such a letter or letters had been written, this would do nothing to confirm the veracity of Oti’s purported recantations of 23 November 1994.
	
	
	Mr Dursun’s evidence of having spoken to the appellant in Parramatta Correctional Centre before going to Honiara in November 1994, of accompanying Mr Jameson and obtaining Oti’s recantations similarly provides no confirmation of the substance and effect of those recantations.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Court rejects the appellant’s contention in ground 3(a) that Mr Dursun’s evidence “consolidates the conclusion that the appellant’s guilt is not established beyond a reasonable doubt”.
	


Ground 3(b) – evidence of Alan Taciak regarding George


	
	Ground 3(b) repeats the misconception referred to at [239]. Namely, that the failure of the Crown to call a material witness can in some way be factored into an assessment of whether the verdict of guilty was “unreasonable, or cannot be supported” on the basis of the evidence at the trial, taken together with any new or fresh evidence received in this Court.
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Taciak “in relation to the failure to call ‘George’ at trial” which is relied upon for par (b) of ground 3 has been summarised at [199] – [206]. It is invoked by the appellant as proof that George was regarded by the AFP as “reliable” at the time of the trial. That, taken with the circumstance that he now says he does not know of the appellant having conspired to import drugs, is said to lead to the conclusion that he should have been called and that his absence led to a miscarriage of justice. These submissions have been addressed at [206] – [209] in relation to ground 2 and at [210] – [237] in relation to ground 3A.
	


Ground 3(c) – evidence concerning the appellant’s pager


	
	The evidence in relation to the appellant’s pager which is sought to be relied upon for the purposes of par (c) of ground 3 is, first, the evidence on this appeal of the appellant himself. At par 26 of his affidavit sworn 31 May 2013 he deposed that he did not have a pager in May 1985. According to the affidavit he purchased a paging service with Voice Call in about November or December 1985 “and the earliest payment I made was December 1985”, when three months in advance was paid. In cross-examination the appellant adhered to this affidavit evidence. He acknowledged his signature on the Paging Service-Rental Agreement (described at [33]) but said he had put it there in November 1985 upon taking a transfer of the beeper device and an assignment of the contract from another person. He did not identify the transferror.
	
	
	This evidence is to the same effect as the appellant’s unsworn dock statement (see [44](13) and (14)). Although it could have been given on oath or affirmation by the appellant at his trial, evidently a tactical decision was taken that he should not expose himself to cross-examination. We understand the effect of the passages cited at [10] and [11] from M v The Queen to be that the evidence is now to be weighed as part of “the whole case” in deciding whether the verdict is shown to be “unreasonable, or not supported”.
	
	
	Secondly the appellant relies upon an affidavit of Tony Hughes read in the appeal, together with his oral evidence given before this Court. Mr Hughes only commenced employment in the telecommunications industry in 1987, two years after the date at which facts relevant to the operation of telecommunications paging services became material in this case. He deposed that alphanumeric pagers were only introduced shortly before 1987 and that, before the advent of these devices, a caller would only be able to make contact with a paging service subscriber if he knew a unique pager number.
	
	
	This evidence is contradicted by that which was tendered at the trial (see [35] – [37]). The Crown called witnesses who worked for the very paging service company which utilised the telephone number that Oti said he was given by the appellant. Those witnesses proved, with the support of contemporaneous business records, that an alphanumeric pager had from 21 June 1984 been on issue under the agreement which bears the appellant’s signature (irrespective of when that signature may have been made). The Crown witnesses at trial proved that a caller might well be able to contact a paging service customer even if the caller only had part of the customer’s name. In oral evidence Mr Hughes, having been shown the Paging Service-Rental Agreement signed by the appellant, said that the caller would have had to give the subscriber’s full name in order to make contact. We do not consider that Mr Hughes was in as good a position as the witness called by the Crown at trial to speak on this subject. We accept Ms Hunter’s evidence as summarised at [36].
	


Ground 3(d) – reasons for the appellant’s visit to the Solomon Islands


	
	In his affidavit filed in this appeal the appellant gave the following explanation for having travelled to Honiara in May 1985:
	


“3. My decision to travel to the Pacific Islands with my family was made around the time that my brother Emile Chidiac was to get married. The primary reason I was going on this holiday was originally to see my architect, Mr Kenneth Low, who was resident at the time in Fiji. I was having problems with the building of our then family home at 30 Ocean Street, Clovelly, New South Wales, which had been designed by Mr Low.

4. My original intention was to fly only to Fiji. My travel agent, Mr Makram Mansour, of the Golden Wing Travel Agency in Campsie, New South Wales, said to me words to the effect: ‘What a waste of a trip. You can do a tour of the Pacific Islands and it would be more cost effective and enjoyable for the family’. The trip we booked was for 10 days to Honiara, Vanuatu and then Fiji and we were staying three days in each of those places. Mr Mansour is now deceased.”


	
	Further evidence explaining these purposes of a family holiday and a visit to the architect in Fiji was given in cross-examination. In addition the appellant filed an affidavit of the architect, Mr Low, sworn 19 October 2012. Mr Low deposed that he was engaged by the appellant in July or August 1981 to prepare plans for a home to be built at 30 Ocean Street, Clovelly. After he had prepared plans the appellant dealt directly with his own builder but called upon Mr Low to attend to difficulties with the job “at least six times in the early 1980s”.
	
	
	Mr Low’s affidavit, so far as relevant, is in these terms:
	


“7. On 24 July 1983, I decided to return to Fiji to recuperate from injuries sustained in a serious motor vehicle accident on 14 July that year in Sydney.

8. Shortly before I left Sydney for Fiji, I recall that I had a telephone conversation with Neil Chidiac during which I said to him words to the effect; ‘If you have any further problems, contact me in Fiji’. In fact, I had told all my clients that I was leaving Sydney and for them to contact me in Fiji if required.

8. To my knowledge, Neil Chidiac was experiencing ongoing problems with the construction, particularly in relation to the water drainage problems, and, at some point in 1984, on a trip back to Australia, Neil Chidiac came to see me and we visited his building site and discussed his problems with the construction. At that visit I also gave Chidiac my business card with my contact details in Fiji.

9. Also at that time, it was not uncommon to have former clients from Australia visit me in person at my office in Fiji often without appointment.

10. On or about May 1985, Neil Chidiac and his then wife paid me a surprise visit at my office in a Naviti Street, Lautoka, Fiji. We talked about his house and the ongoing problems with its construction, and I promised him to make a site visit to investigate the problems the next time that I was in Sydney.

11. I recall that later that evening I had dinner with Mr Chidiac and his then wife in Lautoka where we continued to discuss the problems he was experiencing with the construction and social chit chat.”


	
	A letter from Mr Low dated 25 July 2008 was also tendered in the appeal. This included the following:
	


“Before I left Sydney, I passed over all my clients’ business files and plans, over to my colleague and associate Ian Rixon of Ian Rixon & Associates, Architects in Sutherland, NSW.

At the end of May to early June 1985, Mr Chidiac paid me a visit to my office at 21 Naviti Street, Lautoka, Fiji, and discussed the problems relating to his building under construction.

As I had to travel to Sydney to see my doctors for medical checkups relating to the car accident claims, I promised Mr Chidiac I should call on him when I was next in Sydney, and introduce him to Ian Rixon who could continue to provide him with architectural service.

According to entries in my office diary records –

On 6/6/1985, I flew to Sydney from Fiji.

On 11/6/1985, I called in on Mr Chidiac in Sydney.

On 12/6/1985, I had lunch with Mr Chidiac and a good friend of mine, in Sydney.

On 18/6/1985, I called in to Ian Rixon’s office in Sutherland.

On 19/6/1985, I returned to Fiji.

On 26/7/1985, I was again in Sydney and again arranged with Ian Rixon regarding Mr Chidiac’s house plans.”


	
	In the Court’s view this new evidence of the purported legitimate purpose of the appellant going to Fiji, as a foundation for characterising the diversion to Honiara as a holiday supplement, suffers from significant inconsistency between the appellant and Mr Low and from inherent improbability of the appellant’s account.
	
	
	The appellant deposed that his intended meeting with Mr Low was the “primary reason” for his visit to the Pacific. In cross-examination he said that he pre-arranged, by telephone, his attendance upon Mr Low, as would be expected for a business appointment which was to be the main reason for international travel. Mr Low contradicted this in par 10 of his affidavit, describing the appellant’s call upon him in Fiji as a “surprise visit”.
	
	
	The appellant’s claim that he travelled to the Pacific primarily to consult with Mr Low is highly improbable. In cross-examination he said that he took the house plans with him, met Mr Low at an Indian restaurant and had Mr Low make alterations, in the first instance on a “sketch”, whilst he and Mr Low were together. The sketched changes were incorporated into amended plans of whic",2016-07-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701372,Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Fajloun [2016] NSWSC 927,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Wahib Fajloun, the Contemnor, must be sentenced for contempt of the District Court of New South Wales. The Contemnor is serving a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four years and eight months, imposed upon him after trial. During that trial the Contemnor engaged in conduct that was a contempt in the face of the Court. The sentence imposed (and the charges preferred) were for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and demand property in company with menaces with intent to steal. They were imposed on 2 April 2015 and the non-parole period is to conclude on 5 December 2017.
	
	
	The proceedings now before the Court were commenced by Summons filed on 19 May 2015 seeking declarations that the Contemnor is guilty of contempt and sentencing the Contemnor accordingly.
	
	
	Originally there were six charges for contempt, the first of which has now been withdrawn and the Contemnor admits his guilt on the five charges for which he must now be sentenced. I take that plea of guilty into account for its utilitarian value.
	


Facts


	
	The issues of fact before the Court are within narrow compass. The two co-accused were on trial, as previously stated, for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and demand property in company with menaces with intent to steal. The trial was occurring before the District Court. The identity of the Judge is irrelevant. Contempt is committed against the court, not the particular judge.
	
	
	There is an Agreed Facts document tendered for the purpose of sentencing (Exhibit A), which details the factual context in which the contempts occurred. As earlier stated, the Contemnor and his co-offender, Mr Bragias, were tried before the District Court and on 19 February 2014 each entered a plea of not guilty to the charges preferred. The matter proceeded to trial between 26 May 2014 and 3 June 2014.
	
	
	On the third day of trial, Wednesday 28 May 2014, the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined a witness, in the absence of the jury. During that cross-examination the Contemnor began to laugh. The following exchange then occurred:
	


“HER HONOUR: Mr Fajloun, if you continue to laugh --

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: This is a joke.

HER HONOUR: Well, sir.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: This is a joke. You keep going the same stupid things --

NIELD [Barrister for Mr Fajloun]: Please, please, please, please.

HER HONOUR: The witness is entitled –

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: If you don’t want me to laugh stop being a joke, tell him to stop being a joke –

NIELD: Please, please, please.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: You keep asking the same questions … (not transcribable) … and that’s it –

HER HONOUR: Yes, Mr Crown?”


	
	The foregoing exchange was the first charge of contempt which was withdrawn and is not now a matter before the Court in terms of a charge for contempt. Nor is it relevant to any other issue.
	
	
	On the fourth day of the trial, Thursday 29 May 2014, shortly after her Honour indicated that the Court would adjourn for lunch and was walking off the Bench, the Contemnor stood up and said:
	


“Fuck you!”

This was a remark directed at the Judge. The Contemnor then leaned forward and spat in the direction of her Honour. The spit did not make contact with the Judge or another person. The foregoing exclamation and conduct in spitting amounts to Charges 2 and 3.


	
	On the fifth day of the trial, Monday 2 June 2014, when her Honour was discussing a matter with the Contemnor’s co-accused in the absence of the jury, the Contemnor made the following remarks towards her Honour:
	


“ACCUSED FAJLOUN: Fuck you, you fucking lying cunt. You fucking start talking –

NIELD: Wahib, Wahib, Wahib.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: You’re fucking talking shit. She’s lying. She’s a lying dog. Lying fucking dog.

SPEAKER: Wahib. Wahib.

NIELD: Wahib.

HER HONOUR: I’ll come back when he’s settled down.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: She’s a fucking dog.

SPEAKER: Wahib. Wahib.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: She’s a lying dog. Fuck that. Fuck.

SPEAKER: Wahib. Wahib.

ACCUSED FAJLOUN: Fucking … (not transcribable) … I’m going home. Please Mum, just go home.”


	
	From the last comment it may be possible that it was his mother that was the speaker that was unidentifiable in the transcript. In any event the foregoing exchange is the conduct in which Charge 4 is preferred.
	
	
	On the same day, as her Honour began to leave the Bench, the Contemnor picked up a paper cup from which he had been drinking and threw it at her Honour. While the cup travelled some distance, it landed in the witness box and did not make any contact with any person in the courtroom. The throwing of the cup is the conduct on which Charge 5 is based.
	
	
	On the sixth day of the trial, Tuesday 3 June 2014, the Contemnor’s counsel indicated that the Contemnor had withdrawn his instructions and sought leave to withdraw from the trial. Her Honour granted leave (if leave be necessary) and the Contemnor’s counsel left the Court. Her Honour discussed with the Contemnor arrangements to be put in place for the continuation of the trial and the engagement by the Contemnor of new legal representation. During that discussion, the Contemnor swore at, and spoke over, her Honour as follows:
	


“I assumed that apart from your other biases that you might give me a fair chance here but obviously I was wrong, but just understand that I don’t have any chance at communicating with anybody, all right, I’m going to speak to you slowly because you seem to ignore everything I say … [Transcript 335.22 – 335.26];

I don’t even want to give you the chance to explain yourself because you’ll make up some rubbish. [Transcript 337.44 – 337.46];

Why don’t you come here on the Queen’s Birthday if you’re so concerned about this case, come and take time off your personal life instead of getting paid to fuck me all the time.” [Transcript 340.33 – 340.36]

The foregoing exchange was the basis for Charge 6 in the Summons.


	
	Following an application by counsel for the co-accused, Mr Bragias, her Honour discharged the jury and a new trial for the Contemnor and Mr Bragias was listed for 8 October 2014.
	
	
	The Agreed Facts do not suggest, despite the order in which it is placed, that the application for a new trial was on account of the comments by the Contemnor. Each of the exchanges between the Contemnor and her Honour were in the absence of the jury.
	


Relevant Principles


	
	Contempt is a common law offence and the punishment is at large (subject only to the Bill of Rights 1688) and a conviction for contempt of Court is a conviction for an offence, criminal in nature. There is some doubt as to whether the proceedings are criminal. In my view, the proceedings are civil, but the punishment is dealt with in the same way as a punishment for crime and the burden of proof of any matter to be taken into account against the Contemnor, either at trial or in the sentencing proceeding, is a matter that the plaintiff or prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Further, the matters that are relevant to the fixing of an appropriate punishment are the matters that one would normally take into account in the punishment of a crime: Registrar the Court of Appeal v Maniam (No 2) [1992] 26 NSWLR 309 at 314 (A-B).
	
	
	By operation of the Supreme Court Rules 1970, the Court is entitled to punish contempt either by a fine or imprisonment or both and, if a term of imprisonment is fixed (or, for that matter, a fine), the punishment may be suspended either with or without conditions.
	
	
	As a consequence of the status of contempt as a common law crime, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“Sentencing Act”) applies in determining the punishment to be imposed: see Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court of NSW v Jando [2001] NSWSC 969; (2001) 53 NSWLR 527 at [45]. At both common law and under the Sentencing Act, a sentence of imprisonment is a sentence of last resort and, if a suspended sentence is appropriate, the Court must first come to the conclusion that no other sentence other than a custodial sentence is warranted and, having come to that conclusion, then consider whether full-time custody or a suspended sentence ought to be imposed.
	
	
	In terms of the seriousness of contempt, a contumacious contempt is in the worst category. A contumacious contempt is one in which the contemnor intentionally disobeys an order of the Court or its authority and seeks consciously to defy the authority of the Court. This is a contempt aimed at the integrity of the courts and designed to degrade the administration of justice. It requires wilfulness.
	
	
	At the lowest level or category of seriousness is technical contempt and between those two extremes is wilful contempt, which is a contempt that requires wilfulness, but does not involve a conscious defiance of the authority of the Court.
	


Factors


	
	In Commissioner for Fair Trading v Partridge [2006] NSWSC 478 at [22] Bell J considered the matters to be taken into account in assessing the proper punishment for contempt. Her Honour’s list is not exhaustive, but includes:
	



	
	The seriousness of the contempt proved;
	
	
	Whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to himself of what he did;
	
	
	The reason for the contempt;
	
	
	Whether there has been any apology or public expression of contrition;
	
	
	General and personal deterrence;
	
	
	Denunciation of the contempt;
	
	
	The character and antecedence of the contemnor.
	



	
	These factors are commonly applied by judges in assessing contempt and the punishment to be imposed.
	
	
	The conduct of the Contemnor, in this case, is a serious contempt. The Contemnor has wilfully insulted a judge in the course of proceedings, which “necessarily interferes, or tends to interfere, with the course of justice” (Lewis v Judge Ogden [1984] HCA 28; (1984) 153 CLR 682 at 689 (per Mason, Murphy, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ).
	
	
	As the High Court in Lewis explained, there is a fundamental distinction between discourtesy and wilfully insulting conduct. It is the latter which is the hallmark of contempt of this kind. Thus, the responsibility of counsel (or self-represented persons) to plead the case fearlessly and with vigour and determination does not amount to contempt. But such a responsibility is not inconsistent with courtesy.
	
	
	Nevertheless, mere discourtesy is not wilfully insulting conduct. There can be no doubt that the conduct that gives rise to the five charges to which the Contemnor has pleaded is wilfully insulting. Further, the conduct was intended to be intimidating and the atmosphere was extremely tense.
	
	
	The outbursts and conduct of the Contemnor were, it seems to me, spontaneous and not planned.
	
	
	The foregoing comment is not intended to condone or lessen the seriousness of the conduct, except that it related to the conduct of the trial and interlocutory issues, rather than dissatisfaction at a judgment on the merits, which, in my view, would be more clearly a defiance of the authority of the Court: Rich v Attorney-General (Vic) [1999] VSCA 14, (1999) 103 A Crim R 261 at [55].
	
	
	Nevertheless, the conduct of the Contemnor is extremely serious and is conduct that fails to accept the authority of a judicial officer and the Court in terms which are both contemptuous and insulting.
	
	
	Having made the foregoing comment, I am not satisfied, to the requisite standard, that the conduct of the Contemnor resulted in the discharge of the jury. The immediately preceding conclusion may be a two-edged sword.
	
	
	While I accept that the conduct was neither planned nor premeditated, the fact that the conduct occurred in the absence of the jury and never in the presence of the jury shows a capacity on the part of the Contemnor to control his conduct, when it suits him. As a consequence, the actions of the Contemnor are not wholly unthinking.
	


Other Factors


	
	It is fair to say that the learned Judge and the Contemnor’s counsel warned the Contemnor about his conduct. Understandably in the circumstances, this was done when each were seeking to quieten the Contemnor. There is no evidence that either the Judge or the Contemnor’s counsel advised the Contemnor as to the consequences of his conduct, either in terms of possible discharge of the jury and a retrial, or in terms of punishment for contempt.
	
	
	Further, the Contemnor has a significant criminal history and was before the Court for a serious crime. It is an important aspect of the criminal justice system in this country that, ordinarily, criminal guilt is decided by the application of the common experience and common sense of a jury. Interference with that process is not only an interference in the administration of justice, but a disregard of a safety mechanism provided to persons accused of serious crime.
	
	
	I turn then to the existence of remorse, the possibility of rehabilitation and the existence of an apology or public expression of contrition.
	
	
	In these proceedings the Contemnor has relied upon an Affidavit sworn by him on 11 December 2015. The Affidavit formally admits guilt to the five charges of contempt and agrees to the facts in the Statement of Agreed Facts prepared in September.
	
	
	The Contemnor describes the “spitting” incident as one in which no saliva left his mouth but, rather, a spitting noise and motion imitating the action of spitting was performed. The Contemnor seeks to explain that, in his cultural background, such an action is intended to indicate a sign of disrespect.
	
	
	I am not certain that the explanation assists the Contemnor. He also sought to explain, by a reference to the fact that the Crown were asking repetitive questions under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, the laughing that occurred in relation to those matters set forth in paragraph two of the Agreed Facts. He describes himself as “an idiot” for vocalising his frustration and for expressing the thoughts that were going through his head.
	
	
	He also explains that the throwing of the empty cup was done in annoyance and not as an attempt to assault her Honour or cause her Honour any injury. I accept that explanation.
	
	
	The Contemnor also explains that the days were long, starting at 4.00am to be woken in order to be brought to Court for a 10.00am start, and the absence of the complainant for the first couple of days was a matter where he thought he was being the subject of games that were being played.
	
	
	The tiredness and lack of sleep due to stress are given as reasons for his conducting himself in a way that he ought not. The Contemnor describes himself as an “emotional wreck”, in part because he could see how much it was upsetting his mother and partner, both of whom were in Court each day.
	
	
	The Affidavit, which, I repeat, was sworn evidence, describes the effect on the Contemnor when he read the brief for these proceedings and after hearing from his lawyers and his mother and he describes what he did in Court as him being “disgusted and ashamed of” himself. He says (at paragraph 14 of the Affidavit):
	


“I made a disgrace of myself in front of my mother, partner and the public. I saw my mother cry. That only added to my feelings of anger and frustration at the situation I put myself in.”


	
	While he refers to the bullying he experienced while growing up and his feelings of frustration as a “voiceless participant” in what he considered was an “unfair trial” he makes clear that, in hindsight, he saw “the stupidity and offensiveness of [his] actions”. He also makes clear that were he to appear again before the Judge he would offer her his “deepest and most sincere apology because as both a judge and a woman, she should not have been spoken to in the way that I did”.
	
	
	Tendered to the Court is also a letter of apology from the Contemnor, which I will not repeat in full. Nevertheless, it is fair to describe it as a complete and unqualified apology for the conduct in which the Contemnor engaged. I am told, and accept, that the apology was unsolicited and not the subject of advice either from counsel or his instructing solicitor.
	
	
	The apology is written to the Court and expressly says it is with “all sincerity and contriteness”. The Contemnor makes clear that he is not trying to excuse or defend his behaviour during the trial in the District Court but, instead, is asking for mercy “from a judicial system that owes me none”.
	
	
	The Contemnor reiterates that he is guilty of contempt; that he is ashamed and disgusted at himself; that he caused his mother and partner more shame and embarrassment than they deserved; and that he directed his confusion and fear during the trial at the Judge, who deserved nothing but respect and received nothing from him but arrogance and stupidity.
	
	
	He describes himself as a “fool”. He then goes on to describe what has happened to him since his trial. This aspect I shall recite:
	


“I have been blessed with a strong faith and have embraced Christianity since coming to gaol. Even against God have I sinned according to the Bible. Secular powers are described as God’s servants to punish evil-doers and encouraging law-abiding citizens (Romans 13:1-6). As a Christian I am to regard the ‘powers that be’ as God ordained (John 19:11) and dutifully subject myself to civil authority. Based on all these facts I have sinned greatly and have prayed constantly for forgiveness from God.

But at this point I also seek the forgiveness of Justice [sic] Huggett. I cannot justify myself ethically or morally. I was a fool and humbly hang my head and hope she can know how sorry I am.”


	
	The letter to the Court goes on to accept the authority of the Court, the need for justice to be done and the benefits of living in Australia and in a democracy with a judicial system that must not be undermined or disrespected.
	
	
	The cynic in me is somewhat sceptical of the extent of the apology. However, it cannot be said the apology is qualified or anything other than full and complete. There is no evidence that the apology is disingenuous.
	
	
	I take the apology as an important factor in determining the degree to which specific deterrence is a factor to be considered in imposing an appropriate sentence. General deterrence is and remains significant. Punishment is also significant.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as earlier explained, the Contemnor was found guilty of, and sentenced for, the crime with which he was charged and was then before the District Court. Any sentence that I impose must comply with the principles of totality and I will impose a sentence, to the best I am able, which takes account of the totality of the criminal conduct and as if the contempt punishment were being imposed at the same time as the sentence imposed on 2 April 2015 and commencing 6 April 2013. The non-parole period for that sentence concludes on 5 December 2017.
	
	
	I take the view that the criminal conduct associated with the contempt is and remains a separate and distinct criminality from the criminal conduct of assault occasioning and demanding property with menaces. As a consequence, it should have a punishment that is cumulative, at least in part.
	
	
	I take account of the plea of guilty which, in matters such as this, is important and involves a significant utilitarian value. Further, in a matter such as this, coupled with the letters and the Affidavit, the Contemnor’s conduct signifies remorse.
	
	
	Given the contents of the letter and the unchallenged change in character brought about by a new religious fervour, the prospects for rehabilitation are good. I do not set the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty at the highest level. I do not consider it occurred at the earliest time. I do not take account of the strength of the Crown case in qualifying the discount, but I set the discount at 17½ %.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the offences are serious. In my view they would ordinarily warrant a custodial sentence but, because of the difficulty of imposing them in the current custodial circumstances of the Contemnor, sentences less than a custodial sentence may more adequately reflect an appropriate punishment for the seriousness and insult to the Court and the defiance of its function.
	
	
	It is an important element of the exercise of judicial power that courts exercise their jurisdictions in a manner which is fair and unbiased and is seen to be fair and unbiased. Unreasonable, inappropriate and insulting attempts at categorising the conduct of an officer of a court, as other than unbiased and fair, strike at the heart of the capacity of courts to undertake their functions and to be seen to be doing so appropriately.
	
	
	Of course, if there be a basis for asserting that a judge is conducting proceedings in a manner that gives a ground for a complaint of apprehended bias (or actual bias), such matters should be raised, but cannot be raised in the manner that the Contemnor sought to do, albeit possibly as a reflection of his perceived frustration.
	
	
	I have considered the comparable cases. Many of them impose sentences that do not seem to reflect the seriousness of the offences involved. The sentences for contempt are generally at a lower level than sentences otherwise imposed for offences involving an interference with the administration of justice.
	
	
	Equality before the law is an essential aspect of the exercise of judicial power and is embodied in the term “equal justice”. It is, as the High Court has made clear, an aspect of the rule of law. It requires that persons who are relevantly equal be treated alike and persons who are relevantly different be treated differently, with the difference between them being a rational reflection of the relevant differences: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	When applied to persons charged with similar offences arising out of unrelated events, the norm of “equal justice” requires “consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence”: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen, at [29], citing, with approval Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [47] – [56].
	
	
	It seems to me, given the seriousness of the offences, the nature of them, the number of them, the fact that they occurred over a number of days and the manner in which they disrupted the proceedings, that a custodial sentence would generally be warranted and a non-custodial sentence would not ordinarily sufficiently reflect the seriousness of the offences in question.
	
	
	The qualifications on the general rule is the totality principle and the need to fix and impose a sentence that, on the one hand, reflects separate punishment for these offences and, on the other hand, does not impose a sentence greater than the total criminality warrants.
	
	
	If I were sentencing at the time of the current sentence being served, I could have fixed a commencement date before the current sentence. To fix a sentence now that, without any further wrongdoing, required more time in custody would pay insufficient regard to the rehabilitation that the Contemnor has undergone. To fix a sentence of imprisonment and then suspend it, pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would provide no additional penalty for these offences, because of the effect of parole and s 47(4) of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	In the peculiar circumstances of this offender, I intend to fix a non-custodial sentence of some length that will ensure his rehabilitation and good behaviour for a substantially longer period than parole (if granted) would allow.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I make the following order:
	



	
	The Contemnor, Wahib Fajloun, is sentenced, pursuant to the terms of s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the Contemnor is directed to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of four years commencing 6 December 2017 and concluding 5 December 2021.

2701378,State of New South Wales v Hill [2016] NSWSC 913,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: By amended summons filed on 17 March 2016, the State seeks the following relief:
	



	
	An order:
	



	
	pursuant to s 5C and s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 that the defendant be subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order (“the extended supervision order”) for a period of five years from the date of the order; and
	
	
	pursuant to s 11 of the Act, directing that the defendant, for the period of the extended supervision order, comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to this Summons.
	



	
	The prayers for relief in the amended summons are based upon the following supporting documentation:
	



	
	Affidavits of Azam Bulbulia affirmed 1 March, 2 March, 14 March, 18 March, 16 May and 8 June 2016.
	
	
	Affidavit of Clare McNaughton affirmed 11 March 2016.
	
	
	Report of Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 29 April 2016.
	
	
	Report of Dr Kerri Eagle dated 11 May 2016.
	



	
	The orders are opposed.
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, I consider that the application for an extended supervision order should be dismissed.
	


Background


	
	On 21 March 2016, Rothman J conducted the preliminary hearing required under s 7(3) of the Act and made an order under s 7(4) appointing two experts separately to examine Mr Hill and furnish reports of their examinations to the Court. Rothman J also made an interim supervision order under s 10A for a period of 28 days to commence on 16 April 2016. On 13 May 2016, Adamson J made an order, pursuant to s 10C (2), renewing the ISO, so as to operate further until 10 June 2016.
	
	
	Prior to the ISO made by Rothman J, Mr Hill had been subject to an extended supervision order for a period of three years, imposed by his Honour on 26 June 2009. Mr Hill has been convicted on multiple occasions of having failed to comply with certain conditions of his ESO and, as a result, has spent significant periods of time in custody. Consequently, by operation of s 10(1A) of the Act, the date of expiry of the ESO has been extended by reference to such periods of time in custody. The ESO expired on 15 April 2016.
	
	
	Mr Hill is a 50 year old Aboriginal male who has previously been convicted of two sets of sexual offences committed in 1993 and 1998. In each case the victim was an adult female and the offences involved the use of a knife to threaten harm to the victim. In each case, Mr Hill was heavily intoxicated and/or under the influence of illicit drugs at the time of the offence.
	
	
	With respect to the 1993 offences, Mr Hill was convicted in 1994 of one count of aggravated sexual assault and one count of attempt to have sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of 7 years with a 4 year non-parole period.
	
	
	With respect to the 1998 offences, Mr Hill was sentenced to a total term of 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years on five counts of aggravated sexual assault, and a further count of aggravated break and enter and commit a felony. In addition to the use of a knife, a further aggravating feature of the 1998 offences was that Mr Hill committed them while on parole for the sexual offences committed in 1993.
	
	
	Mr Hill has continued to deny responsibility for the 1998 offences.
	
	
	Mr Hill’s sentence for the 1998 offences expired on 27 March 2009. Before that occurred, the State commenced proceedings in this court seeking an order that he be subject to an ESO under the Act.
	
	
	That matter was heard in June 2009. On 26 June 2009 Rothman J ordered that Mr Hill be subject to an ESO for a period of three years: see State of New South Wales v Hill (No. 3) [2009] NSWSC 1139. As already noted, Mr Hill has been convicted of failures to comply with the conditions of that ESO on nine separate occasions and has consequently spent significant periods of time in custody.
	


Threshold requirements


	
	The Act sets out certain threshold criteria for the making of an application for an ESO under the Act: see s 5I. In the present case:
	



	
	Mr Hill is a ""sex offender"" within the meaning of s 5B(2) of the Act by reason of having committed sexual offences in 1993 and 1998 that fall within the definition of ""serious sex offence"" within s 5(1)(a) of the Act, and separately as an ""offence of a sexual nature"" within the meaning of s 5(2) of the Act;
	
	
	Mr Hill is a ""supervised sex offender"", within the meaning of s 5I(1) and (2) of the Act, because he is a person who, when the summons was filed, was a person under supervision pursuant to an existing ESO: s 5I(2)(b)); and
	
	
	The application was brought within the last six months of Mr Hill’s current custody or supervision: s 6(2). Mr Hill’s ESO expired on 15 April 2016 and the summons was filed on 1 March 2016.
	


Primary object of the Act


	
	The objects of the Act are stated in s 3 in the following terms:
	


“3(1)    The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)    Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”

The test for making an ESO – s 5B(2)


	
	Pursuant to s 5C(1), this Court may make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a “high risk sex offender”. Subsection 5B(2) provides that an offender is a “high risk sex offender” if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Section 9 applies to an application for an ESO. Under s 9(1), a Court that has received an application for an ESO can either make an ESO or dismiss the application. Subsection 9(3) sets out a list of matters to which the Court must have regard in determining whether or not to make an ESO in addition to any other matter the Court considers relevant.
	


“Satisfied to a high degree of probability” (s 5B(2)) 


	
	The phrase “satisfied to a high degree of probability” constitutes the statutory standard of proof enlivening the Court’s jurisdiction to grant an ESO. It is higher than the civil standard but lower than the criminal standard. Prior to the commencement of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013, the phrase “satisfied to a high degree of probability” appeared in s 9(2), as part of the test to be met for the grant of an ESO under s 9(1)(a).
	
	
	In State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364, Beech-Jones J observed at [22] that the structure of the Act in its current form (which now accommodates the making of orders against high risk violent offenders as well as high risk sex offenders) appears to require:
	



	
	that the Court first undertake a determination of whether a person falls within the definition of a “high risk sex offender” (under s 5B(2)) having regard to the relevant standard prior to considering whether or not to make an ESO; and
	
	
	that it is only once the Court has made a determination that a person is a high risk sex offender that the criteria in s 9(3) are to be addressed.
	



	
	His Honour found that aspect of the amended legislation to be curious insofar as “it is very hard to imagine a case in which a person could be found to satisfy the definition of being a ‘high risk sex offender’ but that a consideration of the criteria in s 9(3) would nevertheless result in the Court dismissing the application”.
	
	
	It has been held that the authorities with respect to the standard of proof as it formerly appeared in s 9(2) of the Act are “equally applicable” to the construction of s 5B(2).
	


“Unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence” (s 5B(2))


	
	The phrase “unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence” was introduced into s 9(2) of the Act by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2010, which commenced operation on 7 December 2010. It replaced the concept of “likely to commit a further serious sex offence”.
	
	
	When the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013 was introduced on 19 March 2013 to establish a scheme for the extended supervision or continued detention of violent offenders, the phrase was relocated to s 5B(2) of the Act.
	
	
	Subsection 5B(3) indicates, as did the former s 9(2A), that the Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is “more likely than not” in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk if he or she is not kept under supervision. The phrase “unacceptable risk” is not defined by the Act. However, as s 5B(3) makes clear, the new test was not intended to elevate the threshold test to be satisfied.
	
	
	In Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57, the Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the expression “unacceptable risk” within the context of the definition of a “high risk violent offender” in s 5E of the Act. Beazley P, with whom Gleeson JA agreed, held at [49]-[58] that a determination as to whether something is unacceptable is an evaluative task, and the words “unacceptable risk” are to be given their everyday meaning, in the context in which they appear. The Court of Appeal relevantly endorsed the approach taken by RA Hulme J in NSW v Thomas (Final) [2011] NSWSC 307 at [58].
	
	
	The State contends that three further points may be emphasised about the jurisprudence on the “unacceptable risk” test and the requirements of that test as it appears in s 5B, read in the context of the Act as a whole.
	
	
	First, it is preferable to avoid putting a gloss on the words of the statute which require the Court to consider matters such as the nature and likelihood of the relevant risk and form a judgment, based on the evidence, as to whether Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk of committing a further serious sex offence. The determination of what is an unacceptable risk may require consideration of various factors (such as the perceived likelihood of recidivism and the type and nature of offences that may be committed absent supervision), and may entail a balancing of factors in cases where they might point towards differing outcomes (such as a low risk of recidivism versus likely drastic consequences to the victim if an offence occurs). Clearly, any analysis of the concept of unacceptable risk involves recognition that there will be a range of factors affecting risk and that some cases of unacceptability will be more obvious than others.
	
	
	Secondly, while it appears that the Court is not required to consider all of the factors listed in s 9(3) in determining whether or not it is satisfied under s 5B(2) to a high degree of probability that a person poses an unacceptable risk of offending (as it must when determining under s 9 whether or not to make an ESO order at all), those factors should nevertheless inform the s 5B(2) analysis: see Fisk at [22].
	
	
	Thirdly, it is important to recall, having regard to s 5B(3), that the Supreme Court may legitimately find in some situations that a person poses an unacceptable risk for the purposes of the statutory test even if the likelihood of them committing a further serious sex offence is determined to be low. Decision-making about unacceptable risk is highly fact-dependent but occurs in the context of ensuring community safety and protection.
	


Discretion not to make an ESO


	
	Under the Act, if the State discharges its burden to establish that an offender is a high risk sex offender under s 5B, the Court still has a discretion whether or not to make an order, and must take into account the criteria in s 9(3).
	


Section 9 factors

Mr Hill’s offending history and sentencing remarks: s 9(3)(h) and (h1)

The 1993 sex offences


	
	On 9 March 1994 Mr Hill was sentenced by Judge Craigie in the District Court in respect of one charge of aggravated sexual assault and one charge of attempt to have sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. The offences were committed at Wellington, NSW on 16 March 1993. The victim of both offences was a 37 year old woman. After initially claiming that the victim had consented, Mr Hill ultimately pleaded guilty.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offences are detailed in the remarks on sentence of Judge Craigie dated 9 March 1994.
	
	
	The victim was walking home from a hotel in the early hours of the morning. As she turned into a laneway Mr Hill was crouching beside an iron fence. He grabbed at her several times stating ""I want to fuck you."" The victim tried to resist him but he grabbed her by the arm and punched her in the mouth. Mr Hill then knocked the victim to the ground and dragged her between a shed and a fence. He attempted to place his penis in the victim's mouth. When the victim attempted to escape Mr Hill placed his hands around her throat and attempted to strangle her, saying ""Shut up, you bitch, I have got a knife in my back pocket, or I will kill you.""
	
	
	Mr Hill then ripped off the victim's bra and other garments and kissed her on the vagina. He forcefully penetrated her with his fingers. During the assaults the strap on the victim's bag broke and Mr Hill placed the strap around the victim's neck and commenced to strangle her with it. When she called out that she could not breathe Mr Hill pulled the strap tighter and said ""Just shut up or I will kill you."" The victim nearly lost consciousness before he let go of the strap. When the victim then felt the strap on her arm and attempted to throw it away, Mr Hill struck her with it. The victim's cries for help were heard by neighbours who called the police. Mr Hill was found at the scene in a position on top of the victim. He was arrested after attempting to climb over a fence.
	
	
	Judge Craigie noted expert evidence regarding Mr Hill’s history to the effect that after bouts of excessive alcohol consumption he becomes disinhibited and prone to violence, sexually and otherwise. Judge Craigie noted that Mr Hill had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol shortly before the sex offences ""but not enough to blot out his intentions"".
	
	
	Judge Craigie sentenced Mr Hill to imprisonment for a total of 7 years expiring on 31 October 2000 with a 4 year non-parole period. He became eligible for release on parole on 31 October 1997.
	


The 1998 sex offences


	
	On 23 April 1999, Mr Hill was found guilty by a jury of five counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of aggravated break and enter and commit a felony. He committed the offences on 28 March 1998, while on parole in respect of the sex offences committed in 1993.
	
	
	The circumstances of the 1998 offence are set out in the remarks on sentence of Judge Taylor dated 18 August 1999 and in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal dated 16 February 2005: R v Hill [2005] NSWCCA 44.
	
	
	The victim was a 42 year old woman who did not know Mr Hill. The circumstances of aggravation were the threat to inflict actual bodily harm on her by means of a knife. At an initial stage of the assaults Mr Hill held the knife to the victim's throat. The victim cut her hand when feeling where the knife was positioned.
	
	
	The offences were committed at Dubbo and took place over a period of about an hour and a half. The sexual assaults commenced after Mr Hill broke into the victim's house at 5:30am. She noticed a strong smell of alcohol on her attacker. Mr Hill denied he was the attacker and the issue before the jury was identification. Judge Taylor described the Crown case as very strong.
	
	
	The offences were premeditated and although the victim did not know Mr Hill, he made known to her during the assaults that he was aware of personal details about her, including her name, marital status, occupation and other intimate details.
	
	
	The sexual assaults committed on the victim included penile vaginal penetration, penile anal penetration, digital vaginal penetration, and digital anal penetration. Mr Hill also told the victim that he intended to come back to see her again. Mr Hill was arrested within a few hours of the offences taking place.
	
	
	In his remarks on sentence, Judge Taylor said:
	


“Throughout the attack upon her the complainant was in fear for her life. This was a particularly brutal and savage attack upon the complainant and one can only imagine what she suffered and the consequences that this vicious attack has had upon her. The apprehension of fear, the terrifying circumstances of a life threatening situation makes these matters very serious.

The Court takes into account the nature and degree of violence and the degree of premeditation.

The fact that the offender was only recently released to parole for a similar matter has given the Court cause for a great deal of concern.”


	
	In recounting Mr Hill’s criminal history, Judge Taylor noted that ""[h]e has a history of violence against women."" This included a history of domestic violence against his de facto wife and a number of breaches of domestic violence orders. Judge Taylor also accepted the views set out in a report of Ms Anne Young, senior psychologist, to the effect that the index sex offences together with the 1993 sex offences and the previous domestic violence offences were part of a continuing pattern of behaviour and as ""manifestations of a long term underlying difficulty"".
	
	
	In respect of each of the five counts of aggravated sexual assault, Judge Taylor sentenced Mr Hill to imprisonment for 10 years with a 7 year non-parole period. In respect of the further count of aggravated break and enter and commit a felony, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. Both sentences commenced on 28 March 1999 and were concurrent. Mr Hill became eligible for release on parole on 28 March 2006.
	
	
	On 22 September 2004, some five years after the expiry of the time allowed for the filing of an appeal, Mr Hill filed a notice of appeal against his conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave to extend time for the filing of the appeal against conviction, determining that there was no substance to any matter that he wished to raise and because the delay in filing the appeal had not been satisfactorily explained: R v Hill [2005] NSWCCA 44.
	
	
	Mr Hill has continued to deny responsibility for the 1998 sexual offences.
	


The connection between Mr Hill’s use of illicit drugs or alcohol and his risk of sexual offending: s 9(3)(i)


	
	Mr Hill’s use of illicit drugs or alcohol has been identified by various professionals, and also Mr Hill, as a substantial factor in his risk of re-offending. It is high risk behaviour which directly relates to his offending.
	
	
	In her report dated 11 May 2016 Dr Kerri Eagle diagnosed Mr Hill as having a severe substance abuse disorder. Dr Eagle further states: “it is apparent that his use of substances has a clear correlation with his sexual offending.”
	
	
	In addition, a pre-sentence report dated 22 November 1990 said of Mr Hill:
	


“He freely admits his past history of offences has occurred whilst he has been under the influence of alcohol.”


	
	In a later pre-sentence reported dated 6 April 1993 the probation officer said:
	


“He is described as being argumentative when intoxicated, leading on occasion to violent behaviour. It is believed by family members that [Mr Hill] needs a structured environment to acknowledge his problem and learn to control his severe behavioural changes when under the influence of alcohol…

[He] impresses as a man who is not fully aware of the effects alcohol has on his behaviour and it appears he has of late attempted to curb his intake. However, if he does not resolve his alcohol problem his future prognosis is poor and in light of his attitudes his motivation must be considered irresolute.”


	
	In his remarks on sentence in respect of the 1993 sexual offences, Judge Craigie referred to the expert report of Dr McMurdo to the effect that:
	


“…after bouts of excessive ingestion of alcohol, the offender becomes disinhibited and somewhat violent sexually…”


	
	Mr Hill has a number of convictions for assaults and breaches of apprehended violence orders. In his report dated 15 November 1993 Dr McMurdo reported that:
	


“Your client admitted that he had quite regularly assaulted his partner. This was only after he had been drinking. He said that he became sexually and physically aggressive towards her and had been put on a restraining order because of this, but she had continued to live with him.”


	
	Dr McMurdo emphasised that it was essential that Mr Hill does not consume alcohol in the future. In respect of the 1993 sexual assault offence, Dr McMurdo said:
	


“He fears that he may have become disinhibited (my word not his) because of alcohol and become over aggressive as he frequently had been with his de facto partner.”


	
	In his remarks on sentence, Judge Taylor referred to the drinking of alcohol as a risk factor that had been present prior to the commission of the index offences.
	
	
	In a psychological report dated 15 April 1996, Anne Young said:
	


“Mr Hill also has a past history of alcohol abuse which appears to have been worse since 1988. In the weeks before the offence he lost his job and his wife had left him. Due to his drinking and violence towards his wife there had been several prior separations.

…

He says that he realises that he will have to remain abstinent from alcohol to reduce the risk of violence.”


	
	A Pre-Release report dated 28 July 1997, prepared by the Probation & Parole Service, records that:
	


“Mr Hill agreed that his use of alcohol prior to and leading up to the offence, had spiralled out of control…Hill has admitted that there is a direct link between his sexually deviant behaviour and the disinhibiting effect alcohol has when he consumes it in large quantities.”


	
	In her psychological report dated 16 August 1999, in respect of the 1998 sexual offences, Ms Young stated:
	


“It is of concern that Mr Hill who had previously acknowledged drinking alcohol as a high risk behaviour for himself, was drinking within a very short time of release …

A number of his high risk factors for reoffending were present in the months after his release including drinking alcohol, deviant sexual arousal, and negative mood states.”


	
	The CUBIT treatment report dated 12 August 2008 identifies acute dynamic risk factors as being those that may indicate an individual's increasing immediate risk of re-offending. The report states that:
	


“Specifically, if Mr Hill was engaging in the use of alcohol or other drugs, this would be an immediate indicator of his increased risk of re-offending.

…if Mr Hill chooses to reject supervision by keeping secrets, missing appointments, or breaching conditions (eg not abstaining from alcohol use), he is at an increased risk of reoffending…

Any changes noted in the aforementioned dynamic risk factors should alert Mr Hill, his support network, and other professionals to his immediate increased risk of sexual recidivism and the need for immediate intervention.”


	
	In a risk assessment report dated 23 February 2009, Patrick Sheehan stated:
	


“In Mr Hill's case, there is some evidence that intoxication from alcohol and other drugs is an acute risk factor that is closely associated with his episodes of sexual abuse and other violence. I would not hesitate to specify that complete abstinence from these substances is the only viable option for the future in terms of the successful management of risk in Mr Hill's case.”


	
	In his reasons for judgment dated 28 October 2009, in respect of the imposition of the ESO, Rothman J emphasised the link between alcohol and Mr Hill’s risk of sexual offending: State of New South Wales v Hill (No. 3) [2009] 1139 at [7]. In a subsequent judgment published on 21 December 2010, dealing with an application by the State to vary the terms of the ESO, Rothman J emphasised that illicit drugs were similarly linked to Mr Hill’s risk of sexual offending: State of New South Wales v Hill (No. 4) [2010] NSWSC 1504 at [5]:
	


“[5] Mr Hill was granted bail in 2008 and relapsed into use of drugs and alcohol, for which his parole was revoked. As was made clear in the third judgment at [7], abuse of alcohol was a significant factor in each of Mr Hill's sexual offences, and I quote:

‘[7] Abuse of alcohol was a significant factor in each of the sexual offences with which Mr Hill has been charged over the years. It is generally accepted that, in the absence of alcohol or alcohol abuse, Mr Hill does not pose a significant threat of the kind with which the Act seeks to deal. Nevertheless, Mr Hill does pose a significant and dangerous threat, if and when Mr Hill imbibes alcohol. Fundamentally, the issue in these proceedings is whether there is, overall, a high degree of probability that Mr Hill is likely to commit a further serious sex offence, if he were not kept under supervision: see s 9(1)(a) of the Act. Necessarily, that depends upon the risk, if any, that Mr Hill will drink alcohol.’

[6] I add that the reference should also have been to the participation in illegal drugs.”


	
	In State of New South Wales v Hill (No. 5) [2013] NSWSC 140, dealing with a further application by the State to vary the ESO, Rothman J said:
	


""[19] As already noted, a significant risk factor that I had mentioned on past occasions was Mr Hill's use of alcohol and illegal drugs…

[20] I am still of that view. As is obvious from the proceedings over some significant time and the judgments I have issued, Mr Hill is an impressive person who, in my inexpert opinion, is intelligent with significant practical intelligence. He does not pose a threat, or a significant threat, when not affected by alcohol or drugs. Nevertheless the case notes tendered in these proceedings show that Mr Hill has been detected using cannabis, methylamphetamine, oxazepam and temazepam. I also note the statements by Mr Hill that he believed his urine sample would show up ‘bupe’, a reference to buprenorphine. Some or all of these drugs are disinhibitors. Such drugs, in terms of the risks to which the court has already referred, are as problematic, if not more problematic, than alcohol.

[21] It is to Mr Hill's credit that he does not seem to have used alcohol. Nevertheless, it seems he takes a different view in terms of illicit drugs.

…

[24] As is obvious from the foregoing, I take the view that Mr Hill has to understand that the disinhibiting and mind-altering effect of illicit drugs make them as dangerous, or more dangerous, for Mr Hill than alcohol. This is not ‘wowserism’, the experience in this court is that so-called ‘soft’ drugs have enormously deleterious effects on the consumer over the long term.

[25] Whatever be the long-term effects, the disinhibiting aspects make the use of illicit drugs a significant risk factor for Mr Hill. As a consequence, Mr Hill's motion is dismissed. It is not simply that the court could not be seen to be countenancing their use; it is, for Mr Hill, extremely problematic.”


	
	His Honour went on at [30] to say that ""Mr Hill poses a significant risk overall because of the risk that alcohol and drugs will be consumed.""
	
	
	In his psychiatric report dated 3 March 2016 Dr O'Dea said at [66] that ""it would appear reasonable to link, in a significantly direct manner, Mr Hill's history of Substance Abuse and Paraphilic Disorder."" Dr O'Dea further said, at [68], that Mr Hill will need to remain abstinent from alcohol and illicit drugs in the long term in order to manage and minimise his risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours.
	


Sex offender treatment programs: s 9(3)(e)


	
	Mr Hill undertook the CUBIT program for high risk sex offenders while in custody prior to the ESO being made. He completed the program on 21 July 2008. His participation in the program is detailed in the CUBIT treatment report dated 12 August 2008 and also in the risk assessment report of Patrick Sheehan dated 23 February 2009.
	
	
	Mr Hill’s progress during CUBIT was twice interrupted when he was suspended from the program and he reportedly found it challenging and encountered difficulties at various stages. His overall participation in CUBIT was described as mixed, with improvements shown over time. On the negative side, Mr Hill encountered a number of difficulties during his time in treatment resulting in a lengthy suspension for aggressive behaviour within the CUBIT community. He also appears to have been somewhat ambivalent. Mr Hill was described as having made progress on a number of issues, including improving his emotion recognition skills, challenging unhelpful thoughts, intervening in aggressive behaviour, improving his self-esteem, improving his coping strategies and relationship skills. Further, after his return to CUBIT from suspension, his involvement and progress within the program was generally at an improved level.
	
	
	In his risk assessment report, Mr Sheehan describes the CUBIT program as having been ""an arduous process for Mr Hill"".
	
	
	While on release in the community, on parole prior to the current ESO being made, Mr Hill attended some group sessions in the community-based maintenance program conducted by the Forensic Psychology Services division of Corrective Services NSW at Surry Hills. His attendance was interrupted by periods of incarceration.
	
	
	After the making of the ESO in June 2009, Mr Hill reportedly attended seven sessions of the custody-based maintenance program between October 2009 and April 2010, with his participation being described as ""varied"".
	
	
	Mr Hill has also attended sessions of the community-based maintenance program since June 2009. He was referred, and re-referred, on a number of occasions, with his attendance again being interrupted by periods of incarceration. In March 2011 he was assessed as not suitable to continue in the community-based maintenance group due to hostility and lack of motivation, and its impact on group dynamics. Subsequently, Mr Hill was required to attend individual maintenance sessions on a 3-weekly basis. His participation, interrupted by periods of non-attendance including as a result of re-incarceration, was described as ""mixed"". Speaking of his attendances in 2012 Ms Donaldson reported:
	


“Mr Hill's progress in community-based maintenance was mixed. He experienced emotional outbursts; engaged in a range of justifications and distorted ways of thinking (e.g., about his drug use); shifted between attempting to assert some control over his situation, whilst placing responsibility onto others (those involved in his supervision); and demonstrated limited insight into a risk situation he had placed himself in (e.g., related to a volatile relationship). Mr Hill had difficulty challenging problematic thoughts, or recognising the need to challenge them.”


	
	Subsequent re-engagements with the Forensic Psychology Services have been relatively limited, as described in Mrs Donaldson's report, although prior to his most recent arrest and incarceration in October 2015, Mr Hill appeared to be engaging more positively. In respect of his engagement with sex offender treatment generally, Ms Donaldson concluded in January 2015 that:
	


“Overall, Mr Hill's participation in sex offender specific treatment indicates that Mr Hill gained an intellectual understanding of treatment concepts; however, he did not internalise or consistently apply learnt skills into his everyday life.”

Section 9(3)(f) - level of offender's compliance with any obligations to which he has been subject while on parole or while subject to an earlier ESO

Non-compliance with prior parole orders


	
	Mr Hill has a history of failing to comply with conditions of parole and having his parole order revoked. The 1998 sexual offences were committed while he was on release on parole in respect of the sentence imposed for the 1993 sexual offences.
	
	
	Mr Hill also has a history of previous failures to abide by community-based orders while under the responsibility of Probation and Parole prior to 1998.
	
	
	With respect to the 1993 sexual offences Mr Hill was released on parole on 31 October 1997. The Parole Board revoked this parole on 30 March 1998. During the period of parole, difficulties encountered with Mr Hill’s supervision included:
	



	
	being asked to leave his former partner’s home when smelling of alcohol;
	
	
	in breach of a direction by Probation and Parole to have no contact with his former partner, Mr Hill being observed under the influence of alcohol at her residence resulting in her requesting police assistance;
	
	
	failing to attend appointments with his psychiatrist;
	
	
	contacting his former partner in breach of parole conditions;
	
	
	being subject to an AVO being made on behalf of his former partner.
	



	
	Mr Hill was released on parole on 2 September 2008 in respect of the sentence of imprisonment for the 1998 sex offences. His parole performance is recorded as having declined markedly over time.
	
	
	Contrary to his parole conditions, Mr Hill tested positive for methylamphetamine in November 2008, which resulted in a breach report and a warning letter from the State Parole Authority. A subsequent urine sample, taken in December 2008, tested positive for cannabis. Mr Hill was later observed acting strangely in the city around midnight on 31 December 2008, in breach of curfew requirements.
	
	
	On 30 January 2009 police reportedly observed Mr Hill in Kings Cross drinking beer at 11:05 pm. He was described as loitering in a darkened area and being slightly affected by alcohol.
	
	
	On 6 February 2009, following receipt of a breach report, the State Parole Authority made an order revoking Mr Hill’s parole. He was returned to custody on 7 February 2009. On 11 February 2009, Mr Hill was convicted in the Local Court of failing to undergo a breath analysis on 7 February 2009.
	


Level of compliance with ESO


	
	Since June 2009, Mr Hill has been convicted and sentenced in respect of a number of breaches of the ESO, as well as for an offence of threaten/intimidate a community corrections officer. These are referred to below in more detail.
	


Report from Corrective Services NSW - s 9(3)(d1)


	
	A New South Wales Corrective Services “risk management report” dated 24 February 2015 has been prepared pursuant to s 9(3)(d1) of the Act by Terry O’Brien of Community Corrections. The report outlines a management plan that has been formulated to assist Mr Hill’s supervision and case management, should he become subject to an ESO. Ms Clare McNaughton has provided an updated Risk Management Report dated 27 October 2015, and a further update to the Risk Management Report, dated 11 March 2016.
	
	
	Subject to Mr Hill’s continued progress, the risk management plan contemplates continuation of supervision on ‘Stage 4’ (without the imposition of electronic monitoring, a requirement to provide a weekly schedule of proposed movements or a curfew). Elements of the risk management plan would include weekly reporting contact, both at Community Corrections offices and at Mr Hill’s residence, random urinalysis and breath analysis. He would also continue to attend the Forensic Psychology Services sex offender maintenance program, which is available only to persons subject to court-imposed orders or parole.
	


Psychiatric evaluation and risk assessment: s 9(3)(c), (d) and (i)


	
	Dr Andrew Ellis and Ms Katherine Jones provided a report dated 22 September 2008 on behalf of the NSW Community Forensic Mental Health Service. They referred to Mr Hill’s history of significant substance abuse and his previously demonstrated alcohol and cannabis dependence. Dr Ellis and Ms Jones noted that:
	


“During therapy he was open about his deviant sexual fantasies concerning rape, his interest in cruising for victims to rape and his tendency to get sexual pleasure out of frightening or hurting his sexual partner or victim.”


	
	Under the heading “Psychiatric Diagnosis” the authors referred to Mr Hill’s sadistic paraphilia and antisocial personality traits:
	


“Mr Hill presented with a history of sadistic paraphilia by causing psychological suffering with intrusive fantasy urges and behaviour supporting this. These thoughts and fantasies related to his negative self-esteem, stressors and negative life situation. He denies experiencing any of these thoughts and urges since incarceration.

Mr Hill presents with antisocial personality traits such as a lack of respect for authority (charges whilst in prison), irresponsible and exploitative sexual behaviour, impulsive behaviour and decision-making, irritable and aggressive behaviour.”


	
	In the course of the ESO proceedings in 2009, Dr Anthony Samuels and Dr Samson Roberts were appointed by the Court separately to examine Mr Hill and provide expert reports. Dr Samuels provided a report dated 20 April 2009. Dr Roberts provided a report dated 4 May 2009. Dr Bruce Westmore also provided a report dated 28 May 2009. Each of these doctors emphasised the role of alcohol in Mr Hill’s offending history.
	
	
	After referring to further risk factors , including use of alcohol and illicit drugs, Dr Samuels said:
	


“Given these risk factors I think without appropriate supervision there is a likely risk that [Mr Hill] could commit a further sex offence if released to the community.”


	
	In his report, Dr Roberts said:
	


“Based on the information provided, it is my opinion that Mr Hill represents a high risk of offending both violently and sexually. In forming this conclusion, several matters were considered. Mr Hill scores in the high range on the STATIC 99. Whilst he has participated in various programs, including the CUBIT program whilst in custody and has developed a certain insight into his conduct, it is evident that he has not successfully integrated the theory presented to him into his day-to-day conduct. There are several accounts in the material, which reflect Mr Hill’s propensity to revert to old patterns of interpersonal conduct and old attitudes when confronted or placed in a position in which he perceives a threat or challenge. The manner in which Mr Hill described a variety of issues at the time of my assessment of him, reflected a disorganized pseudo-philosophical rambling which, despite initially sounding superficially sophisticated, was lacking in substance and largely meaningless.

…

Further compounding Mr Hill’s risk with respect to reoffending, is his derisive attitude towards control orders and those administering them, which at times he is able to contain. However in particular with respect to his attitude towards substance use, it is evident that he cannot even maintain an outward impression of acceptance in this regard.

It is my opinion that in the absence of supervision, Mr Hill is likely to reoffend. In my opinion, given his dismissive attitude towards supervision, only with the strictest supervision in place, would this risk be mitigated.”


	
	Dr Westmore did not recommend that Mr Hill be released from continued supervision.
	
	
	Mr Patrick Sheehan, psychologist, provided a risk assessment report dated 23 February 2009. He assessed Mr Hill’s risk of sexual re-offending as falling within the high risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders. Mr Sheehan also identified Mr Hill’s history as consistent with a number of traits of Antisocial Personality Disorder.
	
	
	Ms Meagan Donaldson provided a psychological risk assessment report dated 21 January 2015. She assessed Mr Hill by reference to both static and dynamic risk factors. Applicable dynamic risk factors included problems with general self-regulation, problems with supervision and treatment, problems with intimate and non-intimate relationships and problems with sexual self-regulation. Substance abuse was identified as an acute dynamic risk factor. Ms Donaldson concluded that Mr Hill continued to present a high risk of sexual offending relative to other adult male sex offenders.
	
	
	Ms Donaldson also provided an addendum to her report dated 26 October 2015 which referred to developments since her first report. She concluded that, having regard to static and dynamic risk assessment, Mr Hill’s risk of sexually re-offending remained in the high risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders.
	
	
	Dr Jeremy O’Dea provided a psychiatric report dated 3 March 2016. Mr Hill declined to be interviewed for the purpose of the report, which Dr O’Dea noted in paragraph 7 of his report. Despite this limitation, his report provides a current and detailed analysis of factors applicable to Mr Hill and his risk of sexual recidivism. Dr O'Dea noted Mr Hill’s extensive history of alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence and, in particular, his more recent abuse of amphetamines. Dr O'Dea further noted the history obtained by Dr Ellis, including the rape fantasies experienced by Mr Hill around the time of his 1993 sexual offence.
	
	
	In his report, Dr O'Dea stated:
	


“[63]…I note Mr Hill's history, from his teenage years, of Substance Use Disorder, including alcohol, cannabis, amphetamine and heroin abuse and dependence, with at least ongoing amphetamine abuse in the community in 2015, and despite ongoing alcohol and other drug counselling and rehabilitation.

[64] Although I am not aware that Mr Hill has been given a definitive diagnosis of a personality disorder, I note that he has been considered to display antisocial personality traits.

[65] I also note that, by virtue of his reported urges and fantasies, and supported by his history of sex offending, Mr Hill has been diagnosed as suffering from a Paraphilic Disorder of Sexual Sadism Disorder, and gave a history of a relatively high sex drive and sexual activity.

[66] As I have not conducted a psychiatric assessment of Mr Hill in person, I am not in a position to make definitive psychiatric diagnoses regarding Mr Hill, nor make definitive statements regarding his risk management issues. However, it would appear reasonable to link, in a significantly direct manner, Mr Hill's history of Substance Abuse and Paraphilic Disorder.

[67] On the basis of Mr Hill's reported history of sexual sadism, his history of repeated sex offending, including whilst under community supervision, and his ongoing significant substance abuse and dependence, including in the recent past, it would seem reasonable to assume that he has a significant risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence, as defined in the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, particularly if he were to continue to use alcohol and/or illicit substances, with this risk the appropriate focus of specific and structured risk management, including psychiatric treatment and risk management, in the community in the long term.

[68] Furthermore, It would appear reasonable to assume that Mr Hill will require to remain abstinent from alcohol, amphetamine and other illicit drug use in the community in the long term, in order to manage and minimise his risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence, as defined in the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006.

[69] This crucial goal of abstinence in the community would best be achieved by Mr Hill engaging in ongoing structured and supervised alcohol and other drug counselling and rehabilitation in the community in the long term, including consideration of residential alcohol and other drug rehabilitation in the community, at least in the medium term.

…

[70] In conjunction with this medical management of his Substance Use Disorder, Mr Hill should be referred to a suitably qualified and experienced forensic psychiatrist, for further assessment and treatment of his diagnosed Paraphilic Disorder. The combination of ongoing and active Substance Use Disorder and Paraphilic Disorder, in particular Sexual Sadism Disorder, would significantly increase the risk of a person engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence as defined in the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and both should be assertively treated in the long term in order to manage and minimise this risk.”


	
	Dr O'Dea assessed Mr Hill as presenting a high risk of sexual re-offending. Dr O'Dea continued:
	


[79]…With this in mind, from a full clinical psychiatric risk management perspective, and as judged by various actuarial and more so called dynamic risk assessment instruments, Mr Hill's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term would seem to be considered significantly high and appropriate for specific psychiatric treatment as outlined above.

[80] More specifically, it would seem reasonable to consider that there would be a significantly high degree of probability that Mr Hill would be likely to commit a further ‘serious sex offence’ (as defined in Section 5(1) of the New South Wales Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006) in the community in the long term, if these above outlined treatment interventions above, and in particular successful psychiatric treatment of his Paraphilic Disorder and abstinence from alcohol and illicit drug use in the long term, were not successfully implemented in the context of community supervision and monitoring…

…

[82] Despite the fact that he has been under supervision in the community on a number of occasions since 2009, Mr Hill's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community, and of committing a further serious sex offence in the community, remains long term, and of at least a further 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate risk management program implemented should be long term and at least of 5 years duration, and should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”

Reports of the Court-appointed psychiatrists – s 9(3)(b)


	
	Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Kerri Eagle were appointed by the Court to assess Mr Hill and review the extensive documentation that has been generated in connection with him. Both experts support the making of an ESO for an extended duration of five years.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt provided a report dated 29 April 2016, following an assessment of Mr Hill on 11 April 2016. He diagnosed Mr Hill as having a:
	



	
	personality disorder: “[Mr Hill] demonstrates an enduring and inflexible pattern of behaviour that deviates from cultural norms with poor impulse control and maladaptive interpersonal functioning that is self-damaging and harmful to others. I would regard him as having a mixed personality disorder manifesting antisocial (he has a history of offending in the long-term in adulthood) and borderline (he has a history of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, he engages in impulsive self-damaging behaviours, and probable affective instability) personality traits.”
	
	
	history of substance use consistent with a substance use disorder (currently in remission);
	
	
	paraphilia disorder.
	



	
	Dr Allnutt said:
	


“Given his history of voyeurism, stalking behaviour, and recurrent offending with a non-consenting person over a period of years, I would regard as manifesting a paraphilia disorder. Definitively diagnosing the nature of his paraphilia is difficult. It remains unclear to me whether he has experienced sexual arousal predominantly of the physical or psychological suffering another person, or whether the non-consensual interactions utilising weapons and threats are to achieve the sex act alone. Taking information as a whole, differential diagnosis would include: a sexual sadism disorder (non-consenting sexual activity with sexual arousal associated with physical or psychological suffering of another person, use of strangulation and derogatory words such as ""bitch"" and ""slut"") or an unspecified paraphilia disorder (utilising threat and intimidation to achieve non-consensual sex act, but not necessarily due to a need for physical or psychological suffering of another person to achieve sexual arousal).”


	
	Dr Allnutt regarded Mr Hill as presenting with a high loading of clinical risk factors. He assessed him as presenting at least a moderate high risk of sexual recidivism.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt said:
	


“He has a history of engaging in a number of wide ranging offences through his life. He has been convicted of two serious sex offences of a similar nature which is supportive of a pattern and consistent with in my opinion an underlying paraphilia which drives the offending.

This vulnerability persists and requires ongoing monitoring and rehabilitation. His offending has been associated with substance use and he has had difficulty since 2009 in maintaining abstinence...

On this basis despite his possible abstinence since 2013 and current acceptance of the need to be more compliant to his conditions, it is premature to change his risk status without further evidence of stability. I would regard him as remaining in a group of sex offenders of at least a moderate high risk of future sexual recidivism as compared to other sex offenders, having regard to the entirety of the information provided to me.”


	
	Dr Allnutt recommended consideration of anti-libidinal medication. Dr Allnutt considered that Mr Hill “must remain involved with a community sex offender rehabilitation program” and must abstain from substances.
	
	
	Dr Eagle provided a report dated 11 May 2016, following an assessment of Mr Hill on 13 April 2016. She reported Mr Hill’s accounts regarding the circumstances of the 1993 and 1998 sexual offences, the latter of which Mr Hill continued to deny. Dr Eagle also noted Mr Hill’s report that he had forced his ex-partner to have sex and that “I just wanted to humiliate.”
	
	
	Dr Eagle regarded Mr Hill as having: “demonstrated limited insight into his offending behaviour, his substance use difficulties and his treatment needs.”
	
	
	Dr Eagle further said that Mr Hill:
	


“…denied any substance use disorder, referring to himself repeatedly as a ‘user’ not an ‘addict.’ He said he would cease his methadone as soon as he was off the order. His description of the 1993 Offences contained repeated minimisations and justifications for his behaviour, including to some extent victim blaming. He was unable to identify any ongoing problems associated with his offending (including his substance use or even his acknowledged resentment towards his mother). He justified his repeated breaches of his supervision order.”


	
	Dr Eagle diagnosed Mr Hill as having a:
	



	
	Severe Substance Use Disorder: “He has displayed persistent problems involving the use of methamphetamines, heroin and cannabis. Despite the restrictions he has been placed under and the repeated sanctions he has received, he has continued to engage in problematic substance use. He has demonstrated the use of substances to cope. He has experienced a severe adverse psychiatric episode (psychosis) as a result of his substance use. He has demonstrated repeated failed attempts to control or reduce his substance use.”
	
	
	Sexual Sadism Disorder: “he experienced recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the psychological suffering of others (for instance the humiliation and fear of females) and this manifested in stalking and sexual offending behaviours. These behaviours occurred over a period of at least 12 months on one occasion (leading up to the 1993 offences). At the time of interview Mr Hill minimised and denied sexual arousal from the suffering of others but acknowledged a feeling of power and control when intentionally inducing the fear of a female. In several other reports (Ellis 2008; Young 1997; Young 1999) Mr Hill has been reported to have admitted to rape fantasies associated with sexual arousal, utilising pornography involving submissive females and getting sexual pleasure out of frightening or hurting his sexual partner.”
	
	
	Antisocial personality traits: this included “a failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviour (as evidenced by his repeated and versatile offending behaviours); deceitfulness; impulsivity; aggressiveness; a reckless disregard for the safety of others; consistent irresponsibility and lack of remorse.”
	
	
	Psychopathic personality traits. Mr Hill displayed a high number of psychopathic personality traits using the PCLR assessment.
	



	
	Dr Eagle said the personality traits are pervasive and may explain some of the difficulties that have been encountered with Mr Hill’s treatment and supervision. She assessed Mr Hill using assessment tools and clinical judgment. In her opinion, Mr Hill fell within a category of persons at high risk of sexual offending. Dr Eagle indicated that:
	


“In an analysis of Mr Hill's offending behaviour, it is apparent that his use of substances has a clear correlation with his sexual offending. Other factors of concern are Mr Hill's ongoing casual sexual contact with potentially vulnerable persons such as female substance users and prostitutes given his history of sexual deviancy. A scenario of particular high risk for Mr Hill would be the use of substances in the context of exposure to vulnerable persons perceived as available for casual sexual contact.”


	
	Dr Eagle also concluded that, given Mr Hill’s deviant sexual disorder, anti-libidinal medication should be considered. In addition, she recommended that he be required to attend a further period of a residential rehabilitation drug and alcohol program to address his substance abuse disorder.
	
	
	Dr Eagle’s view of the conditions that the State sought to impose was as follows:
	


“Having regard to the above, I am of the opinion that the more restrictive conditions sought in the Amended Summons may assist in reducing Mr Hill's reoffending risk. Specifically, increased monitoring strategies ought to be done at the same time as assertive efforts to address Mr Hill's risk factors (such as his substance use disorder and deviant sexual disorder) for there to be a realistic prospect of effectively reducing Mr Hill's overall risk.”

Section 9 factors: Crown’s submissions


	
	All of the s 9 factors are relevant to the safety of the community: s 9(3)(a). The Crown contended that the following matters should be emphasised regarding the s 9(3) factors, which are relevant not only to the discretion to grant an ESO, but also to the question of whether the Court would ultimately be satisfied that Mr Hill is a “high risk sex offender” for the purposes of s 5B(2). Mr Hill:
	



	
	has a history of sexually offending against adult women in circumstances of aggravation involving the use of a knife;
	
	
	is assessed as suffering from a Paraphilic Disorder of Sexual Sadism, and reportedly admitted to having experienced rape fantasies at the time of the first sex offences;
	
	
	continues to deny responsibility for the 1998 sex offences for which he was convicted;
	
	
	is assessed as having antisocial personality traits, and also psychopathic personality traits;
	
	
	has a history of abusing illicit drugs and alcohol including, methylamphetamine. As the Court has held, and consistently with the expert evidence including that of Dr Eagle, the abuse of illicit drugs and alcohol is closely linked to Mr Hill’s risk of sexual re-offending;
	
	
	has recently been convicted of having used methylamphetamine in contravention of a condition of his current ESO and was released from custody only as recently as 28 February 2016;
	
	
	has a history of failing to comply with parole and supervision requirements, and has been convicted, on multiple occasions, of having breached conditions of his ESO;
	
	
	is recently assessed by Dr O’Dea as presenting a “significantly high” risk of sexually re-offending, and by Dr Eagle as falling within a category of persons at high risk of sexually re-offending. He is similarly assessed by Ms Donaldson as having a risk of sexually re-offending that is within the high risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders;
	
	
	has been assessed by Dr O’Dea with a long term risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community despite having been subject to supervision on his current ESO when not incarcerated;
	
	
	has continuing treatment needs and, as part of an ESO, is able to continue the sex offender maintenance program with Forensic Psychology Services; and
	
	
	in the absence of supervision and support of the type that could be provided by an ESO, is likely sexually to re-offend.
	


Duration – Crown’s submissions


	
	The State submitted that the Court should make the order for five years or such lesser period as appeared to be appropriate. The maximum period permitted by the Act is five years, subject to extension by further application before the end of the period under s 5I(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown contended that Mr Hill’s risk of sexual recidivism, including his severe Substance Abuse Disorder and his Sexual Sadism Disorder, both of which are linked to his sexual offending, support the making of an order for a five year period. The two court-appointed experts and Dr O’Dea all support the making of an ESO for five years. Mr Hill will require long-term monitoring and treatment.
	
	
	Dr O’Dea’s 3 March 2016 report included the following:
	


“Despite the fact that he has been under supervision in the community on a number of occasions since 2009, Mr Hill’s risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community, and of committing a further serious sex offence in the community, remains long term, and of at least a further 5 years duration. Therefore, from a psychiatric risk management perspective, any appropriate risk management program implemented should be long term and at least of 5 years duration, and should be regularly monitored and reviewed every 6 to 12 months dependent on his progress.”


	
	Dr Eagle expressed the following opinion:
	


“If a further ESO is considered appropriate in the circumstances, a period of five years would be a realistic period to attempt to implement the interventions recommended above.”


	
	In this respect it was the view of Dr Allnutt that it was:
	


“…a determination that should be made by a legal adjudicator, not a psychiatrist. The most helpful way I can express this is to say that, given the difficulty he has at this stage maintaining himself in the community, the difficulty will persist for the foreseeable future and requires ongoing monitoring, support and oversight.”


	
	The State maintained that many of the conditions it propounded contained an element of flexibility, so that they could be relaxed over time if Mr Hill made satisfactory progress under supervision. The State contended that the general approach taken by Johnson J in State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [62]-[66] is appropriate:
	


“[62] In fixing the term of an extended supervision order, the Court is guided by the objects in s 3 of the Act to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. Unlike a sentence of imprisonment, an extended supervision order may be varied or revoked under s 13 or a second or subsequent supervision order may be made against the same person: s 10(3). This reflects the different objects of the Act and the measures which the Act allows to achieve those objects.

[63] I do not think it is helpful to draw upon analogies from the area of sentencing law such as the concept of a “crushing sentence”. The totality principle is designed to avoid a Court imposing a ‘crushing sentence’ in the sense that ‘it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release’: R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at 164; [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [17]; Kerr v R [2008] NSWCCA 201 at [27].

[64] The conditions of the extended supervision order which I propose to make in this case will themselves contain an element of flexibility. The Act provides incentive or encouragement for a person to maintain progress towards rehabilitation. The conditions of the order will provide a framework in which an objective measurement of rehabilitation may be made. At the same time, the terms of the order will serve to protect the community. All of this will occur, in this case, in the context of a person released from a decade in custody facing a range of challenges which will test the progress he has made, and allow him to demonstrate progress in a non-custodial, but nevertheless supervised context. This will be a long-term project.

[65] In the circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that an extended supervision order should be made for a period of five years. I do not consider that such a term will have a negative impact on the Defendant’s prospects of rehabilitation.

[66] As Fullerton J observed in Attorney-General for NSW v Hadson at [32], much will depend on how the Defendant responds to the current program and whether any variation to the risk-management strategy is called for as assessed by those who manage him and monitor his progress.”


	
	Applying this approach in State of New South Wales v Atkins [2014] NSWSC 292, Johnson J said at [130] that he did not consider that the Court should fix a period less than that which is necessary in aid of the protection of the community.

	This document raises a series of informative points.
	
	
	First, it is apparent that Mr Hill has not committed a sexual offence since his release on parole following the completion of his period of custody for the 1998 offences. Mr Hill became eligible for release on parole on 28 March 2006 but was made subject to a three year extended supervision order by Rothman J on 26 June 2009. Mr Hill therefore did not commit a sexual offence during the seven years to date following his release and in purely chronological or historical terms has not committed any sexual offence since the second offence in April 1998.
	
	
	Secondly, and as a necessary qualification of the first point, Mr Hill has been convicted of a series of breaches of the ESO that have led to him serving broken periods in custody totalling three years and three and a half months. None of these breaches has involved offending of a sexual nature. Indeed, but for the imposition of the conditions attaching to the ESO, Mr Hill would, all other things being equal, have remained at large in the community.
	
	
	Thirdly, the conditions attaching to his ESO have not entirely prevented Mr Hill from resorting to the use of illicit drugs in any event. For example,
	



	
	Mr Hill’s conviction on 20 December 2011 involved one count related to the use of cannabis and methylamphetamine and a second count of failing to submit to drug and alcohol testing.
	
	
	Mr Hill’s conviction on 19 June 2012 related to a urine sample taken on 1 June 2012 that tested positive for cannabis.
	
	
	Within the period from April to November 2013 when Mr Hill was in the community, further instances of reported or suspected drug use that did not result in a charge or conviction are recorded in the departmental case notes for 6 June, 19 June, 8 August, 22 August, 26 August, 9 September, 16 September, 18 September, 22 September and 12 October 2013.
	
	
	On 28 November 2013 Mr Hill was convicted of having consumed cannabis and methylamphetamine.
	
	
	On 12 June 2014 Mr Hill was convicted of breaching a condition of the ESO following detection of cannabis and methylamphetamine in a urine sample.
	
	
	On 11 September 2014 Mr Hill was charged with two breaches of the ESO conditions, including one charge of failing to provide a urine sample.
	
	
	On 6 October 2015 Mr Hill provided a urine sample that tested positive for methylamphetamine for which he was arrested and charged on 15 October 2015. That offence was dealt with on 23 February 2016.
	



	
	Fourthly, despite detected use of illicit drugs in the approximately seven years to now, none of these instances has been associated with, or has led to, any further reports of sexual offending of any kind, even notwithstanding unanimous medical opinion and judicial acceptance of a strong connection between them.
	
	
	Fifthly, alcohol does not appear to have featured at all in any of Mr Hill’s breaches of the ESO conditions during his supervised time in the community over the preceding seven years.
	
	
	It will be immediately apparent that there is considerable tension between the medical assessments of Mr Hill’s risk of committing a serious sexual offence on the one hand and the way in which he has performed in the community on the other hand. One significant factor that is both recognised by the medical specialists who have examined and reported upon Mr Hill, as well as being quite evident from his conduct, is that he has been conspicuously unconcerned to comply with at least some of the ESO conditions and in fact appears to be quite strongly opposed to the various restrictions that they impose upon him. Despite the extraordinary detail of the several psychiatric and psychological diagnoses and predictions concerning him, I have not been provided with what I regard as a satisfactory explanation for Mr Hill’s conspicuous success in avoiding regression to sexual offending in the context of an otherwise demonstrable lack of concern for less significant breaches of ESO conditions. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that Mr Hill has been very severely and promptly dealt with for these breaches, including reincarceration for periods together exceeding three years.
	
	
	The unanswered question is whether or not Mr Hill’s commendable success in avoiding the commission of any sexual offences is connected to the ESO monitoring and reporting regime or whether it is a function of a more fundamental shift in his endogenous propensities. Regrettably the answer to that question is not assisted by the analysis of any period when Mr Hill has been at large in the community but free of ESO conditions and monitoring. What does seem to me to be important is the fact that Mr Hill has not physically been prevented from being in the company of women but that he has nevertheless managed to avoid sexually re-offending. Clearly enough, whatever cavalier or potentially self-destructive attitude Mr Hill has evinced for the drug regime under which he has been required to operate, the same cannot be said for his attitude to the commission of sexual offences, not to say violent sexual offences.
	
	
	There also does not appear to be evidence of significant regression to alcohol abuse. For example, unless I have misapprehended the evidence, Mr Hill has never been charged with breaches of ESO conditions to which he has been subject from time to time that were related to the consumption of alcohol or to being present on licensed premises or the like. This is of importance having regard to both the demonstrated and admitted association between alcohol induced disinhibition and Mr Hill’s index offences, as well as the expert medical opinions about the relationship between alcohol consumption and the prospect of Mr Hill committing further sexual offences.
	
	
	I raised the relationship between the conditions under which Mr Hill has so far operated in the community and his level of compliance with the conditions with Dr Eagle. I was interested to know what effect the proposed conditions proffered by the State would be likely to have on the chances of Mr Hill committing a further sexual offence. Part of the transcript of that discussion is as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: What I'm interested to know, doctor, is if Mr Hill has the risk of violent sexual re offending and he has the predisposition from a psychiatric perspective which you have identified, which of those conditions alone or in combination do you say would operate effectively to dissuade, even prevent, him from sexual re offending?

A. Well I'd have to make a number of comments about the nature of these types of supervision orders and the evidence behind their effectiveness. There's generally a consensus that they don't prevent re offending, however, they might reduce the person's exposure to scenarios which might increase their risk of re offending. So they're certainly not a preventive measure and I don't think psychiatrists believe that these types of supervision orders will prevent someone with this type of condition from re offending. However, there is some evidence that they can assist or be effective in enabling the person to have an adequate amount of monitoring in order for them to participate in treatments or programs that may be seen to reduce their dynamic or clinical risk factors. So in this case they might reduce his cognitions around his offending; they might be able to reduce his substance use by engaging in drug and alcohol work

Q. They don't seem to have done that in this case yet?

A. I agree.

Q. And that's not been associated with violent sexual re offending.

A. Well, no. But I guess, if a person is perceived to be under a certain amount of scrutiny for a period of time, then their…both their opportunity to re-offend and their perception that re offending might result in a harsh penalty would reduce their risk of re offending during that period of time but not completely.

…

Q. Mr Hill has demonstrated a significant annoyance and frustration with these conditions?

A. Yep.

Q. And he spent about three years and seven [sic, three] months back in gaol for breach of those conditions?

A. Yes.

Q. That rather suggests he doesn't have a difficulty with committing breaches of these conditions?

A. Well it's about his perception. So, in my view, Mr Hill doesn't believe he has a substance use disorder and doesn't believe he should be stopped from going about his life in the way he thinks he should be able to live it. Obviously my view is that he does have a substance use disorder and the use of substances reduces his ability to control his behaviour and thus increases his risk of engaging in violent sexual -

Q. I suppose that's what I'm driving at. He's abused substances?

A. Yes.

Q. Yet it hasn't corresponded in any way with a resurrection or repetition of any violent sexual conduct?

A. I do believe though he perceives that if he were to sexually re offend, that under the supervision order he would be detected and that that would result in a significantly harsher penalty. And so his position is that ‘I have never re offended, but I can engage in substance use freely and at my will’. The difficulty with that scenario is of course that once the conditions are released and he doesn't need to have any drug and alcohol work, identify, attend to any form of monitoring, address any of these cognitions, then he will feel free to do all of the things that expose him to very high risk scenarios associating with others. I mean, I completely accept your point and I think it's a very difficult situation in this case because there has been arguably very little benefit from say sex offender treatment programs for Mr Hill.

Q. This level of insight, that is to say, recognition and understanding and acceptance of the relationship between breaches of conditions and consequences, is a fairly sophisticated notion; is it not?

A. It is absolutely and there's no certainty, it would just be my view.

Q. Without being unfair to Mr Hill, the material I've read doesn't suggest that he operates at an intellectual or cognitive level that is particularly sophisticated; would that be fair?

A. I haven't done a cognitive assessment on Mr Hill. He appeared to be oriented and there were no gross abnormalities in his level of function but certainly I don't know his intellectual capacity. But I agree, given his educational background and his experience and the way he interprets his circumstances, would suggest he has a very concrete or literal interpretation of things which would get in the way of that psycho treatment.

Q. If isn't already clear, what I need to get to the bottom of and what troubles me is, even notwithstanding the imposition of conditions of the sort the supervision order would carry, he hasn't, to the extent that he's been back in the community, re offended even though these conditions are not an absolute bar to his having to him doing so. That's what I have to come to terms with.

A. Sure. Yes, your Honour.”


	
	This discussion continued:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Can I just I'm not being critical but you've emphasised all of the negative sides of that so called high risk scenario identified in Ms McNaughton's report in the last two paragraphs.

A. Mm hmm.

Q. It seems that Mr Hill emerged from that high risk scenario without incident, does it not? In other words, no sexual offending, no violent sexual offending flowed from a situation you've identified as one that places him in a particularly vulnerable position?

A. Yes.

Q. You identified the risks and the negatives. Do we take anything positive from an incident of that sort that you've identified as exposing him to significant risks?

A. If your Honour means that he didn't re-offend in those circumstances, that could be reviewed - that can be viewed as a positive.

Q. When you say it could be, it has to be, doesn't it?

A. Well, it's one incident, in this case, in which he didn't re-offend in that high risk scenario, certainly.

Q. I have to balance all the material and it's the nature of evidence that's placed before me that is directed to identification of the risks?

A. Yes.

Q. I need to be able to put it into context.

A. Yes

Q. You'd be familiar with the fact that Mr Hill maintains that he's being, with these conditions of course, and has been for many years, effectively, not his words, set up to fail. I think he said to someone ""every time I get up, I get knocked down again""?

A. Yes.

Q. And I need to understand both sides of the coin.

A. Absolutely. And all we can go on are the risk factors we know are associated with offending. We know very little about protective factors and the value of protective factors so I take your point, your Honour.

Q. And the reports don't, again for the reasons you've probably adumbrated, don't direct attention to them very much, if at all?

A. That’s because there's not a lot of evidence around what not engaging in offending really means in the long term, particularly in the face of external controls and supervision and other disincentives.”


	
	Dr Eagle’s evidence also contained the following:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Allowing for the obvious fact he spent time in custody with presumably no access to the type of victims that were the victims of these offences, by taking into account the fact that he has been in the community for some considerable time since his release to parole, and bearing in mind the relationship between, if there is one, his sex offending as a young person and his current age, what do we get from the fact that he's been free of offending for so long? What does that tell us, if anything?

A. I think that's very difficult to interpret in this case, given he has been either in custody or under supervision for that entire period.

Q. I've built that in.

A. Yes. Again, you know I think it's very difficult in these situations to know what the effect of that supervision has had in or role that supervision has had in preventing his re offending during that period. I think the concern for me are that he, despite all of the supervision that he has had and the treatments he's had, that he still finds it difficult to even control his own actions to the extent of complying with basic requirements of the supervision order with the knowledge that he could go back into custody. And so my concern would be that, given if you lifted the supervision order, that he would continue to engage in this type of behaviour, such as his substance use and exposure to vulnerable victims, but this would occur on a much higher frequency over, you know, whatever period of time, which he may be able to he may not intend to re-offend initially, but ultimately, if he is continually exposed to those high risk scenarios, that his risk of in fact re offending when he's intoxicated and when his control is reduced, is high.”


	
	Dr Eagle was asked to consider the question of whether Mr Hill’s continued exposure to the present regime of conditions attaching to his ESO might be associated with any negative outcomes. She agreed that if the supervision order were to continue effectively without change, there is a risk that Mr Hill will become angrier and more opposed to the restrictions.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt also gave evidence. Part of that evidence was as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Put another way, external controls that didn't physically prevent the conduct from occurring would demonstrate that the internal controls were having a significant operative effect, wouldn't it? For example, a man in the community who is free to sexually abuse women, because he is not being monitored in any particular way day or night, but declines or does not do it, suggests that the internal controls are a significant factor in that result?

A. Yes.

Q. As opposed to being in prison, where you wouldn't know one way or the other?

A. Correct. However, one has to still bear in mind the, I suppose, motivating effect of the level of external monitoring that may be happening and the person's awareness of more immediate consequences and of discovery.

Q. But this man has demonstrated a complete disregard for external controls to the extent that he breaches the conditions and, even so, hasn't resorted to the sexual misconduct of the sort we are concerned to prevent.

A. True.

Q. What does that tell us?

A. Well, to me, the fact that … there's no evidence for offending, since he's been out in the community, which is 2009, where he had that opportunity, does, in principle, go towards a reduction of concern of risk, in principle.

So, the general principle would be that the longer one is in the community and does not offend, the lower the risk is over time, as far as a risk assessment perspective is concerned, when you're looking at populations of people. Individuals, it's difficult to say, but in populations, that is the general principle.

So…I do think that the fact that he hasn't offended from 2009 to now, which is seven years, since he's since in that opportunity period of time, needs to be seen in a positive light.

Q. When you say ‘needs to be seen in a positive light’, it's unambiguously positive, isn't it?

A. Yes, it is, it's positive. The concerns that balance that, though, are that he is breaching, but the main question is not his breaches, I think, of the orders because I think those breaches are really, in my view, culturally based and, in a sense, a protest. The main concern is the anxieties about whether he's using substances or not because what substances do is they diminish the internal control.

Q. But many of the breaches, I think I'm right, related to the abuse of substances?

A. Well, yes, they do.

Q. And they weren't related coincidently to any of the sexual behaviour we're concerned to prevent?

A. That’s correct.

Q. I don't mean to cut you off, doctor.

A. Yes. If I just could just qualify that, though, that is correct and, again, that is a positive sign. So, in a sense, you could say that those circumstances have been, to some degree, tested.

Q. They have, yes.

A. The problem is - the concern is more, I think, to do with the relapse into significant substance use with an escalation of substances, with a daily loss of judgment and then, potentially, a relapse into the expression of the underlying vulnerability and that's, I think that, to me in this case is the anxiety. The question is how long do you go on trying to restrict that?

Q. That is absolutely the question.

A. That is the question.”


	
	Dr Allnutt went on, significantly in my view, to offer the following opinion:
	


“So, in my view…I placed him more in a moderate high group, rather than a high risk group because, to some degree, there has been - it has been tested. But I have concerns and I need to strictly apply the Static 99 and I would not if he had re-offended in any way, I might have modified a Static 99 score if it wasn't possible, or my overall view into a high risk. But given it's not clear, there's a lot of greyness to this case, there has been a number of - a period of time of non-offending, we kept him in the moderate low risk group, moderate high risk group because of that.”


	
	I raised with Dr Allnutt my concerns about Mr Hill’s regular reincarceration for breaches of the ESO conditions and the effect that it would appear to have had upon him:
	


“HIS HONOUR: It is from my calculations he spent three and a half years in custody for the breach?

A. Yes. When I interviewed him I got a strong sense from him that he felt strongly aggrieved by that. At the same time there is concern for the community. Some are finding a balance between the two, his needs and the community needs and that's a difficult question for your Honour.”


	
	Finally for present purposes, Dr Allnutt’s evidence included the following:
	


“JOHNSON: More broadly, what do we take…from the fact that there has been no sexual offending in 18 years effectively?

A. I think the more relevant period of time would be from 2009 onwards. If we consider that his preferred victim, sexual orientation is female, prison environment so I think what is the more relevant time is 2009 onwards. I think it is relevant. I think it has to be taken into consideration. There have been opportunities and as far as we are aware he hasn't availed himself and he has not acted out in a sexually inappropriate way.

So that is the best way I can answer that question is that that is a factor that needs to be taken into consideration with regard to internal capacities to control himself.

HIS HONOUR: An unambiguously positive factor is it?

A. It's a positive factor. I wouldn't say unambiguous. Unambiguous is that there is no evidence he has offended in that time.

Q. I understand your caveat but I can only operate on the evidence and the

evidence is there has been no such re-offending?

A. There has been no such re-offending.

Q. In that sense it is unambiguously positive isn't it?

A. If I can just understand

Q. Tell me what is negative about the fact he has failed to sexually offend since 2009?

A. It's not unambiguous I think there is a degree of ambiguity to it in that it's an unambiguous fact that he has not offended in that period of time. And that is a positive factor because it suggests internal control. It doesn't necessarily unambiguously negate ongoing risk.

Q. I'm not suggesting that it does?

A. Then in that sense I agree.

Q. Nothing negative can flow from the fact that he has not offended since 2009?

A. I agree, correct.”


	
	Section 5B of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 provides as follows:
	


“5B High risk sex offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a ‘high risk sex offender’ if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	It is not in dispute that Mr Hill is a sex offender. Taking into account all of the evidence, including the wealth of psychiatric and psychological opinions with which I have been provided, as well as the evidence touching the matters to which s 9(3) of the Act refers, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. I am, however, not satisfied to a high degree of probability as required by s 5B(2) of the Act that Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. It follows that Mr Hill is not a high risk sex offender and that he cannot be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.
	
	
	Mr Hill has not committed a sexual offence for the past 18 years. He has not committed a sexual offence while at large in the community since the completion of his non-parole period for the 1998 offences in 2009. Mr Hill has committed several breaches of the conditions attached to his extended supervision order, and has served over three years and three months in gaol as a result. These breaches have predominantly been associated with illicit drug use. None appears to have been associated with or connected to alcohol use or abuse. Mr Hill’s greatest prospects of sexual re-offending are co-extensive with his vulnerabilities to drug and alcohol relapse. This was recognised and applied by Rothman J when he acknowledged that the unanimous view of the expert witnesses who have given evidence on this subject was that Mr Hill could never safely use alcohol, and any use of alcohol by him would render him an immediate risk of re offending. His Honour also said that Mr Hill did not pose a threat, or a significant threat, when not affected by alcohol or    drugs.
	
	
	In my opinion, a finding said to be based upon satisfaction to a high degree of probability that Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision could not be reconciled with the demonstrated absence of sex offending for so long on the one hand and the absence of any satisfactory or demonstrable connection between that absence and the conditions imposed upon Mr Hill since his release on parole on the other hand. If Mr Hill had the propensities for sexual re-offending posited by the experts, it would in my opinion have been more likely than not that he would have regressed at some time during the three years and nine months in which he was at large in the community effectively free from absolute constraints upon his activities. Put another way, it follows almost inevitably if not at the very least persuasively from Mr Hill’s success in controlling the psychiatric and psychological conditions so closely associated with the risk of regression to the commission of sexual offences, from which conditions the experts all contend he suffers, that his success is attributable in very large part to his independent and voluntary decisions to do so. I am unable to accept that Mr Hill has only been deterred or prevented from sexual offending by the extended supervision order conditions, for which Mr Hill has clearly shown a high level of disregard, if not contempt. If the medical opinions and evidence of s 9(3) factors combine to suggest that Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not supervised, they do not in my opinion do so with sufficient force to satisfy me of the existence of such a risk to a high degree of probability. Any finding to such a standard would require me to ignore the historical success achieved by Mr Hill, in varying degrees of significance, since 1998 in general and 2009 in particular.
	
	
	The standard that applies to the relevant finding has been prescribed by the parliament. It is higher than the civil standard. Having regard to the consequences of a finding pursuant to s 5B(2), so much is understandable. Whatever the reason for the prescription of that higher standard may be, I am unable in this case to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that Mr Hill poses an unacceptable risk. The understandably cautious and conservative expert predictions upon which the State relies in my view fail when assessing this risk of re-offending appropriately to accommodate or to take account of Mr Hill’s demonstrated success as a functioning member of the community. The same can be said of the various s 9(3) factors to which the State has drawn my attention. Indeed, having regard to the setbacks encountered by Mr Hill as a person subject to an extended supervision order, with his several breaches of conditions and consequent returns to custody, that success seems to me to be all the more remarkable. It stands in the way of my being satisfied to a high degree of probability that Mr Hill poses the risk in question.
	


Orders


	
	In my opinion the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 9(1)(b) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, the application for an extended supervision order is dismissed.
	
	
	Order the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs of and incidental to these proceedings.

		05 July 2016",2016-07-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701396,R v Nelson [2016] NSWCCA 130,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: Pursuant to a judgment delivered on 3 December 2015, the respondent, Aaron Robert Nelson, escaped a custodial sentence in respect of numerous offences of sexual intercourse involving three young girls. In one case the victim was under 14 years of age and in two other cases the girls were just over 14 years of age. The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against the leniency of the sentences, pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	The first count involved a 13 year old girl (JM). The charge laid under s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) carried a maximum term of 16 years imprisonment. The sexual relationship commenced in August 2013 and continued for several months. The victim gave birth to a child in September 2014, just short of her fifteenth birthday.
	
	
	The other girls, (BR) and (JN), were 14 at the time of the offending. Three charges were laid in respect of each under s 66C(3), which carried a maximum term of 10 years imprisonment. A further charge under this provision was taken into account in sentencing in respect of offences involving each of JN and JM. The sentences imposed in the District Court were as follows:
	



	
		
			
			1
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a person aged 10-14

			s 66C(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Victim JM)
			
			
			Sentence: 2 year suspended sentence with conditions to date from 3 December 2015
			
		
		
			
			2
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a person aged 14-16

			s 66C(3) Crimes Act 1900 (Victim BR)
			
			
			Sentence: 12 month suspended sentence with conditions to date from 3 December 2015
			
		
		
			
			3
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a person aged 14-16

			s 66C(3) Crimes Act 1900 (Victim BR)

			6
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a person aged 14-16

			s 66C(3) Crimes Act 1900 (Victim JN)
			
			
			Sentence: s 9 good behaviour bond, 3 years with conditions to date from 3 December 2015
			
		
		
			
			7
			
			
			Sexual intercourse with a person aged 14-16

			s 66C(3) Crimes Act 1900 (Victim JN)
			
			
			Sentence: s 9 good behaviour bond, 3 years with conditions to date from 3 December 2015
			
		
	



	
	The primary basis on which that degree of leniency was justified was that the offender (a) was a young man (being 18 years of age during the course of most of the offences and 19 years of age in respect of the latest counts); (b) had suffered physical abuse as a child from both his father and his step-father, and (c) had significant cognitive disabilities and mental health problems. As a result, the cycle of abuse has been perpetuated by his abuse of young girls.
	
	
	One is entitled to have deep scepticism about the effectiveness of the criminal law as a mechanism to break such a cycle of abuse. Nevertheless, if the circumstances of the offending, objectively viewed, call for a custodial sentence, that sentence should be imposed (with such leniency as the subjective conditions of the offender require) unless to do so would be futile or would cause more harm than it might prevent.
	
	
	In the present case, the offender’s circumstances invite significant sympathy. However, they do not demonstrate a level of intellectual disability or mental illness which would significantly diminish the moral culpability of the offending. Nor are they such as to demonstrate that the offender should not suffer incarceration, in the light of a period of 7.5 months in custody after breaching bail conditions.
	


Sentencing – offences against JM


	
	It is convenient to address the adequacy of the sentences imposed by reference to that which the sentencing judge accepted was the most serious of the offences to which the offender had entered a plea of guilty, namely the first count of sexual intercourse with JM.
	
	
	The facts surrounding the offending were derived from a statement apparently prepared by the prosecutor. It was, appropriately, expressed in neutral language. It involved the following chronological account. When JM was 13 years old, she moved into the household which was the home of the offender, his mother and his younger brother. That occurred in May 2013, apparently because JM was encountering difficulties with her adult sister. A sexual relationship between the offender and JM commenced in August 2013, when JM was approximately 13 years and 10 months. Before that, and for a period which was not identified but could have been between one and four weeks, the offender and JM were engaged in what was described in the statement of facts as a “relationship”. After the first occasion of sexual intercourse, it was alleged that sexual intercourse continued about three or four times per week. In September (that is a month after the sexual intercourse commenced) the offender started sleeping with JM in her bed.
	
	
	In circumstances not identified, in about Christmas 2013, JM moved out of the household and went to live with her sister for about three months, before returning to the offender’s household. Whether the sexual relationship continued during those three months is not known. It is said to have continued when JM returned to the premises occupied by the offender.
	
	
	The statement of facts blandly stated that “[a]round Christmas 2013 the complainant attended Blacktown Hospital and she was found to be pregnant with the accused’s child.” It was JM’s mother who made a complaint to the police when she learned that the offender and JM were in a sexual relationship. The date of the complaint was not identified. However, the statement recorded that in July 2014 JM “resumed residing with her mother”, although when she had last resided with her mother was not noted. She gave birth the following month.
	
	
	It is tolerably clear from the history set out in the statement that it was JM who resumed living with the offender in March 2014. Nevertheless, the statement recorded that “the accused resumed living with the accused and his family.” That patent error was repeated by the judge in recounting the facts.
	
	
	After noting that the majority of the offences involved penile/vaginal intercourse, the judge stated: [1] 
	


“I am satisfied that there was no force or threats or violence utilised or relied upon by the offender to have sexual intercourse with [JM] or indeed any of the other victims. I am satisfied that even though there may have been occasions when persuasion was needed to instigate sexual intercourse I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities at least that it was consensual although that is not an element of any of the offences. It does, however, impact upon the objective serious nature of the type of sexual intercourse undertaken. I am satisfied that there is no evidence before me that suggests that such sexual intercourse resulted in any pain or injury to the victims.”


	
	The judge also stated: [2] 
	


“In the commission of the offences I accept that there was a degree of emotional manipulation by the offender upon the victims, particularly [JM], in him exercising control over her by way of managing her communications on Facebook.”


	
	In the same context, the judge noted, correctly, that a relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offences was a comparison between the age of the victims and the age of the offender. He described the age disparity as “not great”. [3]  He also noted that the offender was at all stages aware of the ages of his victims.
	
	
	The judge paid specific attention to the question of harm to the victims. What he said in that regard was as follows: [4] 
	


“The courts are entitled to act on the basis that child sexual assault cases cause substantial psychological harm (DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 [38]). In respect of this sentencing process no material has been put before me that suggest [sic] that there has been any substantial psychological or physical harm to any of the victims and accordingly I am not proposed [sic] to take that into account as an aggravating factor.”

Errors in approach

(a)   “consensual” activity


	
	The first error derives from the reference to DBW and the reference to the sexual activities as “consensual”. Those references revealed an approach which was erroneous both as a matter of legal principle and fact.
	
	
	In DBW Spigelman CJ sought to explain that “over the last few years, the public and the courts have become much more aware of, and knowledgeable about, the effects of child abuse.” [5]  The Chief Justice further noted that the Court “would have been entitled to proceed on the basis that there was a substantial risk of emotional harm”, even in the absence of evidence. [6] 
	
	
	Nor was DBW the last word from this Court in relation to this issue: indeed, it was but the first step in departing from an earlier approach which presumed no harm was caused by sexual abuse of young children, in the absence of scientific evidence to the contrary. [7]  Thus, in R v King [8]  the Court stated:
	


“No one could know at the date of sentencing what emotional or psychological harm might have been occasioned to the child in the long term. The early complaint makes its obvious that the child knew that the conduct was wrong and that she found it distressing. It is significant that the act was committed by a stranger. It should not be assumed, without evidence to the contrary, that there was no significant damage by way of long-term psychological and emotional injury resulting from a sexual assault of a child who is old enough, as was the complainant, to appreciate the significance of the act committed by the offender. It should be assumed that there is a real risk of some harm of more than a transitory nature occurring. That should be a factor taken into account when sentencing for a child sexual assault offence. It is an inherent part of what makes the offence so serious. It was the appreciation of the likelihood of harm resulting that Mason P saw as changing the community attitude to sexual assaults against young children: see R v MJR. [9] ”


	
	More recent cases have confirmed that approach. Thus, in R v G [10]  Baroness Hale referred to the “long-term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do.” That proposition was adopted by this Court in R v Gavel. [11] 
	
	
	There may be a risk in overstating the principle in that not every abused child will be profoundly harmed. [12]  However, the sentencing judge should be prepared to have regard to a victim impact statement which may either confirm or contradict the presumption. In the present case, the trial judge omitted reference to the victim impact statement available from JM. That statement included the following passage:
	


“Three years ago I was a little girl who went to school, had friends and went shopping then it all just went away like that. I didn’t tell anyone for a long time as I was too scared of Aaron. The sexual abuse has impacted on my mental health. I have self-harmed and have anxiety and depression. I hate going outside as I think Aaron will be there and harm me or take my daughter. The anxiety has worsened over time to a point I rarely leave the house and when I do it is always with someone else. I don’t like being by myself as I see him when I close my eyes in the shower or when I try to go to sleep. I have a shower with the door open as I think he’s going to get me. I have also made my little sister sleep with me because I don’t want to sleep by myself. Due to my low mood I just want to stay in bed all day, I hardly go out and have no motivation.”


	
	The significance of a victim impact statement was considered by this Court in R v Tuala. [13]  After a comprehensive review of the developing caselaw with respect to the value of victim impact statements, Simpson J (with the agreement of Ward JA and Wilson J) stated:
	


“[77]   By s 28 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, victim impact statements are part of the landscape in the sentencing process. That is not in issue. What is here in issue is the extent to which a victim impact statement can be used to prove an aggravating factor of the kind specified in s 21A(2). Almost invariably the aggravating factor in question is that specified in s 21A(2)(g). It is to be remembered that such aggravating factors must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

[78]   In some of the cases considered above, considerable weight was attached to the manner in which the sentencing process was conducted. Where no objection was taken to the victim impact statement, no question raised as to the weight to be attributed to it, and no attempt made to limit its use, the case for its acceptance as evidence of substantial harm has been considered to be strengthened. (It is, perhaps, a little unfair to take into account that no objection to the admission of the statement was taken, given that such statements are admissible by statute, but that does not preclude argument as to the weight to be attributed to them.)

[79]   Further, where the statement tends to be confirmatory of other evidence (either in a trial, or in the sentencing proceedings) or where it attests to harm of the kind that might be expected of the offence in question, there is little difficulty with acceptance of its contents.”


	
	It the present case it might fairly be said that the statement, the critical passage from which is set out above, is in keeping with the expectations based on recent psychological research and the common experience of the courts. It should have been accepted by the trial judge in the absence of any challenge and it should have been relied upon to support the presumptive position that the offending has caused significant harm to the victim.
	
	
	While acknowledging that lack of consent was not an element of the offences, the sentencing judge placed some weight on the fact that the activity as described by him “was consensual”. [14]  No doubt the use of threats or force in overcoming resistance would be an aggravating factor; however, mere lack of opposition is otherwise irrelevant. The activity was not adequately described as “consensual”; it might be better described as not being the subject of opposition. To treat that as a mitigating factor is to misunderstand the nature of the offence. Lack of consent is not an element of the offence because persons of young age are deemed unable to give informed consent to sexual intercourse, no doubt because they do not appreciate the nature and consequences of the activity. The courts should accept that even when the activity is not opposed by the victim, it will be damaging. Early sexual relationships with adults will often exploit and exacerbate a precarious sense of self-worth and self-respect in the victim, which may have lifelong consequences, including an inability to form stable partnerships in adulthood and possible self-destructive behaviour.
	
	
	Where, as in this case, such consequences are amply supported by the victim impact statement, the sentencing court should generally treat the risk of such harm as having materialised.
	
	
	Furthermore, this material tends to contradict the proposition that an age difference between a 13 year old girl and an 18 year old man is not significant. Although much will depend upon personalities and physical stature, the age difference is significant. A young girl may more readily be dominated by an older man, but may also be more susceptible to manipulation and persuasion by a young man who is undoubtedly older than she is, but is closer to her own age than an abusive adult.
	


(b)   victim in need of protection


	
	Secondly, the judge noted that the events all took place in the home of the offender, which was also the temporary home of each of the victims. [15]  He noted, correctly, that it was a place where “each victim should have had an expectation of safety.” Whilst not erroneous, that proposition failed to take account of the consequences for the victim of a breach of such security. A young person (especially one who has left her family home) will often seek (whether consciously or not) protection from whatever adults may be seen as parent surrogates. This will mean accommodating terms on which such protection may be offered. If that involves a sexual relationship, that relationship should be seen as exploitative. The fact that in each case there was a repeated course of conduct carried out over a considerable period of time exacerbates the level of exploitation involved.
	


(c)   boyfriend/girlfriend relationship


	
	Thirdly, the sentencing judge accepted that the relationship (apparently in each case) “was a romantic one between the offender and each of the victims and classified as a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.” [16]  Such a characterisation is apt to be highly misleading. It is necessary to explore the factors inherent in the relationship, including those set out above. A “boyfriend/girlfriend relationship” may or may not involve a sexual relationship. Further, it may be highly abusive. For the characterisation to be meaningful, these elements should be explored. The fact that the sexual aspect of the relationship was unlawful was a critical factor, not to be ignored. To leave that factor out of account could be seen to reflect the now properly abandoned attitude that personal violence was excusable if it took place within a marriage or similar relationship. It is at least plausible that conduct which takes place in the course of an ongoing “relationship” is more damaging in the long run than at least some forms of isolated sexual activity.
	


(d)   sentences totally concurrent


	
	All of the sentences were fixed to commence from the same date. Such an approach was unwarranted. The offending involved three separate victims and numerous discrete episodes. There was no common factor except for the availability of the victims being resident in his home, the reasons in each case involving their increased vulnerability. To impose totally concurrent sentences was to disregard the important purpose of recognising the harm done to each victim. [17]  It was demeaning to their individual suffering.
	
	
	The seriousness of this error was muted by the fact that all sentences involved conditional liberty, a factor which itself tended to demonstrate the inappropriateness of the sentences.
	


(e)   conclusion as to errors in approach


	
	Each of these factors leads to the conclusion that there was a material error of principle in the way in which the sentencing judge approached the task of assessing the objective gravity of the offending.
	


Subjective circumstances of offender


	
	It is necessary therefore to turn to the subjective circumstances of the offender, the detail of which is set is out by Fagan J.
	
	
	The sentencing judge gave careful attention to the personal circumstances of the offender. He set out in detail his disadvantaged upbringing, including the violence inflicted on him and his mother by both his biological father and his stepfather. The judge was satisfied that “his upbringing provided little guidance or development of his capacity to develop judgment that is expected to be received from parents despite his mother’s attempt to provide care.” [18]  The judge was also satisfied that the offender’s “moral culpability was substantially diminished by the presence of these factors and his significant mental illnesses”.
	
	
	A psychiatrist, Dr Rafe Pulley, had prepared a report on the offender dated 26 November 2015, whilst he was in custody. The report provided an account of his psychiatric history, including suicidal thoughts and his claim that he had “no intent on acting on them”, although he had swallowed a razor blade whilst in hospital and had refused to go to hospital. (The razor blade was passed in his faeces, apparently without causing harm.) Dr Pulley noted that the offender felt that “the world is an unsafe place” and exhibited symptoms “consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of an assault that he sustained at the age of 15 from his stepfather.” [19]  He said that he further met criteria for “major depressive disorder, suffering [from] depressed mood, poor sleep, poor concentration, low energy, low motivation and suicidal thoughts.” Dr Pulley was satisfied that because of his “mental health issues he lacks the skills or opportunity to seek out and form relationships with girls of his own age.” He concluded that this was “a significant contributing factor to his commission of the offences”. [20] 
	
	
	The sentencing judge had before him a pre-sentence report from a community corrections officer, the report being dated 25 November 2015. She stated:
	


“Although Mr Nelson agreed that there was a level of manipulation and coercion of the victims, he appeared to have limited insight into the impact this behaviour would have on the victims.

…

The offender appears to have some insight into his sexual offending in that he was aware of the age of the victims and despite this acknowledged that he had used a level of manipulation in order to coerce the victims into a sexual relationship. His insight in relation to victim empathy is considered to be limited and at interview made statements that attributed blame to the victims such as ‘they were all flirting’ with him.”


	
	The officer noted his claims that he “self-harms at least once per week and has also tried to take his life on several occasions.” The report continued:
	


“Mr Nelson further identified that prior to being held on remand he struggled to leave the family home and suffered from paranoia when in the community. Perusal of Corrective Services records identify that whilst Mr Nelson has been held on remand there have been nine self-harm notifications and numerous threats of suicide.”


	
	The primary judge nevertheless accepted that the offender was “remorseful and is developing an insight into his offending conduct and is commencing to take responsibility for it.” [21]  The offender’s mother gave evidence on the sentencing hearing: the offender did not.
	
	
	In his concluding observations, the sentencing judge stated that he was satisfied that “as a result of his mental illnesses and the history of his self-harming and psychiatric issues whilst in custody his incarceration has been substantially more onerous than a prisoner who can serve his sentence in the general prison population.” [22]  That factor led him to assess the time already spent in custody (233 days) as “being equal to a greater term of imprisonment when compared to that experienced by prisoners in the general population.” [23] 
	
	
	The evidence and findings as to his personal circumstances warranted a significant degree of leniency in sentencing; they did not warrant a rejection of moral culpability, nor indicate a level of incomprehension inconsistent with a custodial sentence. The errors in approach indicate a more serious penalty should have been imposed.
	


Discretion not to intervene


	
	Despite the last conclusion, the Court should not intervene unless affirmatively satisfied that such a course is appropriate. [24] 
	
	
	In support of the view that, if error were established, the Court should nevertheless not intervene, the offender submitted, first, that the Director had not established a good reason why any error should be corrected and, secondly, that he (the offender) had already suffered significant actual anxiety and distress, following service with notice of the Director’s appeal on 24 February 2016. Affidavits concerning his post-sentencing state of health were read in support of that conclusion, which included evidence of significant anxiety and depression.
	
	
	That material included a mental health assessment on his self-referral to Westmead Hospital. He reported suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety, stating “I have a boring life”. However, there was no reference to any concern in relation to his criminal convictions and possible resentencing.
	
	
	On 3 June, the offender attended Goulburn Base Hospital complaining of chest pain and palpitations. A doctor’s report of that date to his solicitor stated that it was “unlikely” that he would be fit to attend court on 6 June 2016.
	
	
	The offender also saw a psychologist, Dr Susan Pulman, on 25 May 2016. The purpose of the consultation was to prepare a forensic report for this Court. Dr Pulman assessed his “new learning and recent memory functioning” as “very poor”, being within a range in which only 3%-9% of age-related peers obtained the same or a lower score. [25]  She concluded that his overall assessment placed him within the extremely low range of intellectual ability (which equated to criteria for a “mild” intellectual disability). She also assessed his scores on depression and anxiety scales as within the “extremely severe” range, and on the stress scale, as within the “severe” range. [26]  She did not seek to assess the likely causes of anxiety or stress.
	
	
	The offender also swore an affidavit on 3 June 2016 describing his fears and anxieties of returning to gaol and noting that he felt safe in a psychiatric hospital. On the earlier occasion in gaol, he noted that he was on “suicide watch” a lot of the time and had no privacy, no clothes, one blanket and no utensils with which to eat. He said that he had seen people being bashed and stabbed, although that did not happen to him.
	
	
	In terms of negative considerations, this was not a case in which it was suggested that the lenient sentencing was invited by the prosecutor, that there had been delay in filing a notice of appeal or notifying the offender of the appeal, nor that the matter had not been expeditiously pursued by the Director. Further, it was not a case in which an appropriate sentence was required as a matter of general deterrence or for factors unrelated to the circumstances of the offender. Although his personal background warranted a finding of a reduced level of moral culpability, and a significant degree of leniency with respect to the penalty imposed, it was not sufficient to warrant no custodial penalty. Further, although there were both threats and attempts at self-harm whilst in custody, he told the psychiatrist, Dr Pulley, that he “was not afraid of his safety and did not believe other inmates were harassing him.” [27]  Dr Pulley also noted a description of “a vague sense of paranoia that was affecting him less in his current environment.” [28] 
	
	
	The other purposes of sentencing, including the need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence and to recognise the harm done to the victims, require that an appropriate sentence be imposed.
	


Resentencing the offender


	
	The power conferred on this Court to intervene in the event that error is established is engaged and should be exercised.
	
	
	The personal considerations identified above warrant a lesser sentence than would otherwise have been imposed for offending of the kind identified. On the first offence, of sexual intercourse with JM, then aged 13 years, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years, which he suspended. With respect to the fifth charge, involving sexual intercourse with (BR), the judge imposed a sentence of 18 months imprisonment, which he again suspended. With respect to the second charge involving sexual intercourse with a person aged 14-16 years (BR) he imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment which was also suspended. In relation to other offences involving BR (counts 3 and 4) and JN (counts 6 and 7) he imposed three year good behaviour bonds. Each of the sentences was fixed to commence from the date of sentencing, namely 3 December 2015.
	
	
	The judge took into account in fixing these sentences a period of pre-sentencing custody referrable to these offences, which may be treated as equivalent to nine months imprisonment. In resentencing the offender, it is necessary to take account of the further period of approximately seven months spent at large in the community, but subject to the conditions involved in the bonds and the suspended sentences.
	
	
	Subject to two matters, in order to give full effect to the time served, both in custody and in the community, and the factors personal to the accused, it is appropriate to adopt the structure of the sentencing accepted by the sentencing judge, but to decline to suspend the sentences of imprisonment and to require that there be a substantial degree of accumulation, to reflect the fact that each sentence of imprisonment will have involved a separate victim. The first qualification is that there should be a degree of accumulation of the indicative sentences. Secondly, it is usually appropriate to backdate the sentence to allow for pre-sentence custody; that course should be adopted in resentencing, while accepting that the result may be an added element of leniency in that the trial judge had taken it into account in reduction of the periods specified.
	
	
	There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the finding of special circumstances and the potential value of a significant further period of conditional release.
	
	
	I would impose an aggregate sentence of three years imprisonment, involving a two year non-parole period, to date from a date 8 months before the day on which the offender is taken into custody, with an additional term of 12 months. The indicative sentences would be the periods proposed by the sentencing judge. A notional accumulation would require that the offender serve a period wholly referable to each count as follows:
	


Count 1 – 18 months;

Count 2 – 6 months, and

Count 6 – 12 months.


	
	In these circumstances, it is not appropriate to maintain the good behaviour bonds which will, in any event, terminate before the completion of the parole period.
	
	
	The conduct with BR involved a degree of coercion. In respect of the third offence involving BR, there was a matter to be taken into account on a form 1 which again involved a significant degree of coercion. Had separate sentences been imposed for each offence there would have been some justification in making the sentences largely concurrent, although that in itself would have involved a significant degree of leniency. In the circumstances the indicative sentences for count 3 should be imprisonment for 9 months and in respect of count 4 imprisonment for 12 months.
	
	
	There were two good behaviour bonds in respect of the victim JN, involving counts 6 and 7. Count 6 involved penile/vaginal intercourse; count 7 involved fellatio, with a further offence involving penile/vaginal intercourse taken into account. An indicative sentence for count 6 should be nine months imprisonment and an indicative sentence for count 7 of 12 months imprisonment. Again, were the sentences to be separately imposed, a significant degree of concurrence would have been appropriate.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	



	
	Allow the Director’s appeal and set aside the sentences imposed in the District Court on 3 December 2015.
	
	
	Resentence the offender to an aggregate sentence imprisonment of 3 years, as follows:
	



	
	make a finding of special circumstances;
	
	
	impose a non-parole period of 2 years with an additional term of 1 year;
	
	
	direct that the sentence shall commence from the date 8 months before the date on which the offender is taken into custody with respect to this sentence.
	



	
	The non-parole period will expire on a date two years from the date on which the sentence commences.
	
	
	Direct that the offender be released on parole at the end of the non-parole period, subject to the prescribed conditions for supervision whilst on parole.
	



	
	ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment of Basten JA and Fagan J. As a consequence, it is unnecessary in these further comments to summarise the facts that have given rise to the offences or the subjective circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	I agree, in general, with the comments of Basten JA, but wish to make some further comments that I understand are not inconsistent with the comments of his Honour.
	
	
	In some jurisdictions, both common law and civil law, (urged in some academic writings for Australia) the age of consent differs significantly from that which applies in NSW and other States. Some jurisdictions, prescribe a variable age of consent relative to the age of the partner until the age of true maturity, namely, 21 or more. Such jurisdictions determine the age of consent by calculating half the age of the partner and adding 7 years. Thus, in those jurisdictions two 14 year olds engaged in sexual conduct or two 15 year olds engaged in sexual conduct are not engaging in illegal conduct. Two 13 year olds would be.
	
	
	In NSW, two 15 year olds engaged in sexual conduct (even conduct short of sexual intercourse) are each guilty of a criminal offence under the law. This pertains to the other States of Australia, as well. I am not, here, either criticising the laws in Australia, nor, advocating a variable age of consent as earlier described.
	
	
	However, such a variable age renders illegal a 30 year old who engages in sexual contact with a 16 year old. In Australia, such conduct would be legal (assuming, for present purposes, that no special relationship exists between the couple). In some respects, a 30 year old who has a sexual relationship with a 16 year old is at least as problematic, if not more so, than two 15 year olds.
	
	
	I make the foregoing comments, not to detract or ameliorate the conduct between the Respondent and his victims but to emphasise the age differential. Even on the variable calculation for the age of consent, referred to above, the difference in age between an 18 year old and a 13 or 14 year old is significant and would be rendered illegal.
	
	
	It is important to understand the significance of the age difference between the Respondent and his victims. A 13 year old, ordinarily, is in Year 7, (or, possibly Year 8), starting the first year of High School and has only recently reached puberty. An 18 year old is permitted legally to drive, to drink, to attend bars and clubs, to smoke, to work and to vote.
	
	
	The capacity to drive and obtain alcohol (or visit clubs) is a subtle and overwhelming distinction and mark of “adulthood” compared to a person who is only just learning about relationships generally and who may well envy the freedom that “adulthood” provides. In my view, the difference between an 18 year old, regardless of the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, and a 13 or 14 year old is extremely significant.
	
	
	Moreover, the law has established an arbitrary age below which consensual sexual relations are impossible. If a person is below 16 years of age, the law regards them as incapable of consenting to sexual contact.
	
	
	There is no evidence to suggest that the cognitive and psychological issues that form part of the subjective circumstances of the Respondent are such as to deny to him the ability to understand that sexual relations with a person under the age of 16 is illegal. While the cognitive and psychological issues affect the culpability for these offences, they do not negate the Respondent’s capacity to control himself to the extent necessary to avoid criminal conduct. I do not accept that the age difference is insubstantial.
	
	
	I turn then to the offending. In my view the offending is serious at a number of levels. First, as earlier explained, it is offending by an 18 year old on 13 and 14 year olds.
	
	
	Secondly, it seems that the respondent has used that age difference to lure his victims away from his younger brother. While there is no aggravation associated with a relationship with a former girlfriend of one’s sibling, it is the age difference which seems to have been one of the compelling aspects of the relationship that was entered into with the Respondent.
	
	
	Thirdly, even after the offence against the first victim and the resulting pregnancy of the victim, the Respondent continued to offend with other persons under the age of 16. Specific deterrence is a significant issue that is not adequately addressed by a non-custodial sentence or a sentence that provides imprisonment only for time served.
	
	
	Assuming for present purposes, that there is a causal relationship between the disability suffered by the Respondent and the commission of these offences, it does not necessarily mean that the offender will receive a lesser sentence or that the disabilities are ameliorative. If, as I understand some of the disabilities are, the disabilities were cognitive, then, ordinarily, they require the adoption of learned behaviours.
	
	
	In other words, persons with cognitive disability are required to learn behaviours that they may be incapable of determining as a matter of executive functioning of their brain. This issue was discussed by the Court in Engert [29]  in which Gleeson CJ said:
	


“In truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this judgment, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public.”


	
	Nevertheless as the earlier passage, to which the foregoing citation refers, makes clear, the effect of such considerations are all factors in a discretionary decision which must be exercised for the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Turning then to the issues associated with the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, the first on which comment has been made in the reasons for judgment of my colleagues, is the question of his youth. A person who is just 18 years of age will be treated not dissimilarly to a person who is 17 ½ years of age. The reverse is also true. But the sentencing of a youth, who is not a minor, must take into account the youth’s age and immaturity. [30] 
	
	
	Greater complexity arises when the subjective circumstances of an offender are, like the Respondent, a combination of youth and mental disability. In Regina v AN [31] , the Court dealt with the combination of mental disorder and youth.
	
	
	The youth in the factual circumstances of AN was 16 years of age and the charges were sexual assault. The Court, in that judgment, said:
	


“[22] But it was not only the age of the applicant and the principles that applied in sentencing a child that needed to be taken into account in the difficult task that confronted his Honour. The evidence was that the applicant was suffering from a mild to moderate intellectual disability. It was because of his mental abnormality that he was found to be unfit to be tried. The applicant had an intellectual age far below his chronological age. Therefore the applicant’s criminal responsibility was not only diminished by the vulnerability and immaturity arising from his youth but also by the mental deficiencies from which he suffered and that resulted in a reduced understanding of the criminality of his conduct and its consequences to the victim and himself.

…

[46] The considerations that apply in determining the significance to be given to general deterrence when sentencing a child are not the same as those which apply when sentencing a person who suffers from a mental abnormality. In the former case the issue is one of weighing the need for general deterrence as against the need to promote the rehabilitation of the child. In the latter case the issue is whether the offender is a suitable subject for general deterrence and, if so, to what degree having regard to the severity of the mental abnormality and its connection with the offence committed. I do not believe that the weight to be given to general deterrence in dealing with a child suffering from a mental disability can be determined simply on the basis of applying only the relevant considerations applicable to a child or only the relevant considerations applicable to a person suffering from a mental disability. Yet this appears to be what his Honour has done by referring only to the passage in Bus quoted above and in the context of considering the relevant principles to be applied when sentencing a child.

…

[50] In any case the statement in Wright, quoted above, is not so simply applied in the present case and it cannot be assumed that, had his Honour considered the relevance of the applicant’s mental condition to the question of general deterrence, he would have given little or no moderation to that element in determining the appropriate limiting terms. As I have already indicated, I do not believe that the issue of general deterrence can be determined by reference to either the age of the applicant or his mental disabilities alone or independently. The real issue was the significance to be given to general deterrence when sentencing the applicant almost three and half years after the offence and in light of the seriousness of the applicant’s offending and his criminal responsibility on the one hand, and his age and mental disabilities on the other. The determination of that issue was no easy task and minds might legitimately differ as to its resolution. But the issue was not appropriately resolved by simply referring to the quote from Bus set out in the reasons set out above.” [32] 


	
	A person such as the Respondent that suffers both cognitive disorder and the immaturity of youth has two disabilities that make each disability more problematic and compound the disabilities, augmenting the significance of each. Thus, this Respondent is not an appropriate example for general deterrence and the level of denunciation is diminished in its significance. [33] 
	
	
	As earlier stated, in my view, notwithstanding the lesser significance of general deterrence, the issue of specific deterrence is significant. The Respondent must understand, or otherwise learn, that the law will punish sexual relations with persons under the age of 16.
	
	
	A non-custodial sentence (particularly in circumstances where he has already served time) will not amount to a disincentive to continue the conduct of that kind. Rather, for someone with a cognitive disability, the time in remand will be seen not as a punishment for the conduct, but as a necessary consequence of the delay in the court process.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by the Court below is a sentence that does not involve full time custody. The sentence imposed is that which is seen as the “punishment” for the conduct.
	
	
	For that reason, I agree with the comments of Basten JA that it would have been far better, particularly because of the subjective issues pertaining to the Respondent, for the sentence to be a custodial sentence that was back-dated, rather than a sentence that was devoid of full time custody, but took into account time served.
	
	
	The foregoing does not underestimate the difficulty of a sentencing exercise of this kind. As was explained in R v AN [34] , the exercise of the sentencing discretion when one is dealing with a youth with cognitive disability and other psychological issues is particularly complicated and particularly difficult. The sentencing judge has adequately discussed the issues and the principles to be applied. The sentencing judge delivered a carefully reasoned judgment.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I agree with Basten JA that the judgment that was imposed reflects manifest error in that it is below the range that is appropriate for these offences and this offender. The imposition of a sentence that is outside the range appropriate for these offences and this offender is sufficient to warrant interference, in the ordinary case. [35] 
	
	
	The issue then arises as to the residual discretion relating to Crown appeals. I agree with the comments of Basten JA on that issue.
	
	
	When sentencing on a Crown appeal that has been successful where the prisoner has already been released, in my view, the Court should have some regard to the added difficulty of once more having to become accustomed to the goal environment.  In my view, however, the sentence proposed by Basten JA is at the lower end of the range available and I would not impose a lesser sentence.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA, which back date the sentence to take account of the time served as part of the non-parole period.
	
	
	FAGAN J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge Hanley SC in the District Court at Penrith. The sentences were handed down on 3 December 2015 in respect of one count of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 14 years (s 66C(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and 6 counts of sexual intercourse with girls under 16 years of age (s 66C(3) Crimes Act). The period of offending was between July 2013 and late September 2014, when the respondent was aged 18 and 19 years (he turned 19 on 8 June 2014). He pleaded guilty to all counts and admitted 3 further similar offences which he requested be taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to ss 32 and 33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The series of offences concerned 3 different complainants each of whom was, at the dates of the offences against them respectively, living in the home occupied by the respondent, his mother, his younger brother (aged 13 to 14 years during the 14 month offence period) and his sister (aged 7 to 8 years at the time).
	
	
	Count 1 concerned complainant JM. It was laid under s 66C(1), JM having been 13 years old when the respondent had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her in August 2013. There was taken into account on a Form 1 a charge under s 66C(3). This concerned penile-vaginal intercourse with JM in January 2014, her 13th birthday having passed following the commission of the Count 1 offence. JM became pregnant as a result of this latter occurrence and gave birth at the age of 14 years in September 2014. His Honour imposed a sentence of 2 years wholly suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Counts 2, 3 and 4 were all of penile-vaginal intercourse with a second complainant (BR, aged 14 years) contrary to s 66C(3). These offences were committed in February and March 2014. In sentencing for Count 2 his Honour had regard to a further s 66C(3) offence committed against BR in the same way, also in early 2014. His Honour imposed for Count 2 a 12 months suspended sentence with conditions. For each of Counts 3 and 4, good behaviour bonds of 3 years duration were imposed pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Counts 5, 6 and 7 were all of penile-vaginal intercourse with the third complainant (JN, aged 14 years) contrary to s 66C(3). Those offences were committed in September 2014. In sentencing for Count 5 his Honour took into account another offence of the same kind against the same complainant, also committed in September 2014. His Honour fixed an 18 month sentence in relation to Count 5, wholly suspended. Three year good behaviour bonds were imposed in relation to each of Counts 6 and 7.
	
	
	All three suspended sentences and all four good behaviour bonds were dated to commence when sentence was handed down on 3 December 2015. His Honour took into account that by that time the respondent had served 233 days (approximately seven and a half months) in custody on remand. The maximum sentence for the s 66C(1) offence against JM was 16 years and for the remaining s 66C(3) counts, 10 years.
	


Ground – 1 seriousness of the offences


	
	Ground 1 is as follows:
	


“1 The sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of all of the offences resulting in manifestly inadequate individual sentences.”


	
	There is an enormous range in the degree of seriousness which may be involved in offending against s 66C(1) and (3). As his Honour correctly recognised, a significant factor in either mitigation or exacerbation of the offence will be the age of the offender (RoS p 11). The respondent had himself only just attained the legal age of majority when he committed these acts. That has a bearing upon his own immaturity particularly in terms of the degree of his appreciation of the vulnerability of a female who is too young to give informed consent and his understanding of the psychological and social harm that may be done to a girl commencing sexual activity at such an age. It also bears upon the degree of disproportionate influence and control which the offender may have. In both of these respects, offending against this section by a man significantly older than the respondent would be viewed as more serious, objectively, than where the age difference is lower, as here.
	
	
	His Honour correctly took account of the complete absence of force, violence or threats by the offender in connection with his sexual intercourse with each of the complainants. The facts tendered by the Crown showed that moderate importuning and emotional pressure had preceded some of the offences. The facts do not reveal exploitation of any of the complainants. This is in part the product of the personal limitations of the respondent, considered below, and the relatively low age differential between the offender and each complainant. The absence of exploitation is significant: R v Sea (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 13 August 1990, unrep); R v Schwenke [2004] NSWCCA 289 at [15].
	
	
	None of the complainants suffered pain or injury in the sexual acts. His Honour acknowledged that he would have been entitled to proceed on the basis that under age sex may cause substantial psychological harm (RoS p 15) but said that no evidence of substantial harm of this nature to any of the complainants was tendered. His Honour did not treat the offences as worsened by any such feature. A victim impact statement of the complainant in Count 1, who had become pregnant to the offender, said that her mental health had been affected.
	
	
	The respondent’s relationship with each complainant was one of boyfriend and girlfriend. This mitigates the objective seriousness: Hogan v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 150. In each case the complainant had at first been in such a relationship with the respondent’s younger brother, without sexual activity. Sequentially, each complainant had moved in to live in the house where the younger brother, the respondent and his family lived, following which the respective complainants’ relationships with the younger brother had ceased and each of them had taken up with the respondent.
	
	
	The repetition of the sexual acts, constituting a course of conduct over 14 months, was an exacerbating feature. So was the fact that when each offence took place the respective complainant was residing in what had become her home, albeit that it was also the respondent’s home. These features were given due consideration by his Honour. The durations of the suspended sentences, 2 years, 12 months and 18 months for Counts 1, 2 and 5, were graded appropriately to reflect the relative seriousness of offending as between these charges.
	
	
	I see no justification for the Crown’s contention that his Honour erred in his appreciation of the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour was entitled to conclude (as appears at RoS p 13) that the offending “falls towards the low range for offences of this type when also taking into account his age”, the differential from the age of the complainants and the nature of the relationship which the respondent had with each of them. The Crown’s written submissions on the appeal characterise the offences as having involved “coercion”. His Honour did not so find. The Crown also asserts that there was “manipulation” and “exploitation” by the respondent of the complainants. I do not accept those descriptions having regard to the narrative of the offences in the statements of facts which were before the learned sentencing judge.
	
	
	The pre-sentence report speaks of the offender having used “a level of manipulation in order to coerce the victims into a sexual relationship”. Manipulation and coercion are different things. The statement of facts would not support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that coercion, in the sense of overbearing the will of any of the complainants, occurred. I would reject Ground 1.
	


Ground 2 – manifest inadequacy of bonds for Counts 3, 4, 6 and 7


	
	Ground 2 is as follows:
	


“2 The sentencing Judge erred by imposing section 9 bonds in relation to charges 3 and 4 (re victim BR) and charges 6 and 7 (re victim JN) which are manifestly inadequate.”


	
	Consideration of this ground, in relation to which the assertion of manifest inadequacy is not limited to his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, requires this Court to have regard to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. These were evidenced by oral testimony from his mother, a report of Dr Naomi Pulley, a forensic psychiatrist (26 November 2015), a report of Doctors Singh and Korner, consultant psychiatrists of Nepean Hospital (15 May 2015), a report of Ms Pamela Allen, an accredited clinical nurse employed in the Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (29 May 2015) and a pre-sentence report from Community Corrections (25 May 2015).
	
	
	From this body of uncontested evidence his Honour was satisfied that the respondent had experienced a traumatic childhood in which he was the victim of domestic violence first at the hands of his father (to the age of 10 years) and then from his stepfather. This disturbed background unsurprisingly led to behavioural problems. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”) in childhood. He also exhibited from an early age Tourette’s syndrome, a condition characterised by muscle twitches and reflexive involuntary utterances of foul language.
	
	
	The above-mentioned afflictions of early childhood necessitated the respondent’s enrolment in a “behavioural school” from year 6. Even in that environment he could not be controlled and he was expelled in year 8. He completed year 10 by distance education, then failed his Higher School Certificate. Since completing his education to a rudimentary level he has had 3 months employment with McDonald’s Restaurants at age 14 but has not worked since. At the date of sentencing he was 21 years old. His prospects of employment then, as now, appeared bleak. The respondent is in receipt of a carer’s allowance from Centrelink for the care of his mother. According to Dr Pulley’s report the mother has bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, liver and bowel disease and breast cancer.
	
	
	In childhood the respondent suffered hallucinations as a side effect of medication prescribed for ADHD. Upon examination and review of his history in November 2015 Dr Pulley found that he met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder consequent upon the mistreatment by his father and stepfather. He was also found to suffer from a major depressive order – in addition to the ADHD and Tourette’s syndrome which are ongoing. Dr Pulley considered that he was possibly mildly intellectually disabled. The respondent has frequently from the age of 15 years been admitted to psychiatric hospitals on account of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. He has made frequent attempts on his own life and he regularly commits acts of self-harm. The latter were observed by Corrective Services during his remand in custody. At the time of sentence he was housed in a crisis unit for inmates at risk of self-harm.
	
	
	In Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465; in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 and in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177] it has been recognised that whilst a psychiatric condition may mitigate culpability, this consideration may be counterbalanced by the heightened risk of repetition of criminal conduct attributable to the relevant condition and the consequent need for protection of the community. In this case his Honour was justified in finding, on the basis of the professional opinions before him, that the respondent did not have a psychiatrically based predilection for underage girls, that his offending was significantly contributed to by social isolation and feelings of personal inadequacy and that whilst his psychiatric history diminished his culpability it did not presage an increased risk of reoffending.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the respondent’s “upbringing provided little guidance or development of his capacity to develop judgment that is expected to be received from parents ... . I am satisfied that despite his age his capacity to exercise appropriate judgment was adversely affected by this factor”. The judgment of the plurality in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571 at [40] – [44] is authority for a sentencing judge to have regard to any proven aspect of deprivation or dysfunction in an offender’s background which may have compromised his capacity to mature and to learn from experience.
	
	
	The present was a very strong case for the application of this principle. The balancing consideration in many such cases of deprived background will be that the offender’s failure to mature in moral strength and self-control may make him a danger to the community – a consideration tending towards full-time custody and a longer term. But his Honour was satisfied that this countervailing consideration was not operative here, where the pre-sentence report indicated that he would only be able to participate in a beneficial sex offender program in custody if incarcerated for 2 years or more, that his risk of reoffending was “medium” and where Ms Allen considered he would benefit from psychological counselling outside the prison system “to address maladaptive coping mechanisms”.
	
	
	It was also proper for his Honour to afford leniency on account of his youth: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [4] – [6].
	
	
	Taking into account the objective seriousness of Counts 3, 4, 6 and 7 together with the subjective considerations mentioned above, the absence of any relevant prior offending, the 25% discount which his Honour allowed for the offender’s pleas of guilty and the fact that 7½ months custody had been served on remand, I do not perceive manifest inadequacy in the imposition of the 3 year bonds for these counts.
	
	
	Of the purposes of sentencing enumerated in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, par (b) (so far as it concerns general deterrence) and par (f) (denunciation) have no significant role to play. That is because the offender’s disturbed background and long-standing mental afflictions make his case an unsuitable vehicle for the public educative effect of denouncing the infringements of s 66C in these particular instances. Paragraph (b) (so far as it concerns specific deterrence) and par (c) (protection of the community) are also of reduced significance where the risk of reoffending has been professionally assessed as no more than “medium” and where counselling and supervision in the community are regarded by responsible professionals as a potentially constructive means for reducing the risk still further.
	
	
	For a young offender in the particular personal circumstances of the respondent, par (d) of s 3A (promotion of rehabilitation) was of great significance in this case. It was open to his Honour to conclude that it would be best served by supervision under the bonds which he ordered and which the Crown now criticises. This level of penalty was capable in all the circumstances of also satisfying the requirements of pars (a), (e) and (f) – ensuring adequate punishment, making the offender accountable and recognising such harm as was done to the complainant and the community.
	
	
	Individually the bonds on Counts 3, 4, 6 and 7 were inconsistent with and more lenient than the suspended sentences for Counts 2 and 5, being like offences against the same two complainants respectively. That does not of itself render the bonds manifestly inadequate. I would dismiss Ground 2.
	


Grounds 3 and 4 – concurrency and totality


	
	Grounds 3 and 4 are as follows:
	


“3 The sentencing Judge erred by imposing concurrent sentences for all the charges in respect of all three victims.

4 The sentencing Judge erred by imposing an overall sentence in relation to the seven charges that was manifestly inadequate having regard to the totality of the criminality for which the respondent was to be sentenced.”


	
	For reasons already given the Crown has not shown that any of the sentences for the 7 counts was individually inadequate. The respondent has rightly conceded that his Honour erred in not considering some degree of accumulation. It was not legally possible to accumulate the suspended sentences in any degree because Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which permits sentences to be given commencement dates which would make them cumulative or wholly or partly concurrent, is inapplicable to suspended sentences: subs (3) of s 12.
	
	
	Had his Honour recognised the need to pronounce sentences for the offences against the three complainants respectively which would be in some measure cumulative upon each other, nevertheless it would have been appropriate in the circumstances of this case to fix non-parole periods and commencement dates which would allow the 7½ months on remand to count as time served. Taking in all of the considerations canvassed in these reasons it would have been within the reasonable exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion to fix terms with non-parole periods partly cumulative totalling no more than the 7½ months. It would have been open to his Honour to impose a bond in respect of at least one of the offences in order to provide ongoing community based supervision, which would appear to be of great importance to rehabilitation of the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour’s remarks on sentence exhibit attention to every relevant consideration except accumulation as between the sentences for offences against different complainants. The overall result of his Honour’s orders is constructive. It balances the legitimate concerns of the community (and of the complainant’s parents in particular) with regard to sexual intercourse with these three girls at such a young age and, on the other hand, consideration for the very unfortunate background and psychiatric history of the respondent and allowance for the level of objective seriousness of the crimes.
	
	
	Although arrived at by way of an erroneous omission to accumulate individual penalties in a manner which would recognise the sequential offending against three complainants, the total effective period of 2 years suspended sentence with an effective additional one year of supervision under bond and 7½ months full time custody already served, was in my opinion an appropriate outcome. Contrary to the Crown’s submission, re-sentencing is not in my opinion dictated by any need to issue guidance to first instance judges with respect to the necessity to accumulate sentences relating to more than one complainant.
	


Allowance for time served on remand


	
	I respectfully consider that it was undesirable for his Honour to have pronounced sentences which, whilst taking into account the period of remand in custody, did not explicitly exhibit that in the form of the orders made. It would have been preferable to achieve the same result by imposing sentences of full-time custody but with short non-parole periods backdated so that they would be treated as having been fully served during the remand. With a total head sentence of less than 3 years it would have been open to his Honour to order the offender’s immediate release on parole from the date sentence was pronounced: s 50(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	Sentencing in this form, with the fact that time served on remand is to count being made apparent in the sentencing orders rather than being buried in the remarks on sentence, is preferred for reasons which have been stated many times: R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245; R v Newman, R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) A Crim R 361 at [22] – [33]; Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30.
	
	
	Street CJ said in R v McHugh:
	


“It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence (and the non-parole or non-probation period) should be back-dated for an equivalent period. This is to be preferred to a process of assessing the proper sentence (and non-parole or non-probation period) and allowing, as it were, a discount in consequence the pre-sentence custody. The desirable practice will promote the accuracy of the record, preventing there being a hidden factor affecting the length of the custody involved in consequence of the sentencing order. In addition, this practice will remove inequalities and unfairnesses as between prisoners arising from delays prior to sentencing, in particular in relation to remission or reduction entitlements; ………. A judge departing from this practice could be expected to indicate his reason for so doing.”


	
	The result of the learned sentencing judge adopting the sentence solution which he did is that the wholly suspended sentences, which are all that show on the record as the penalty imposed, appear much more lenient than in fact the offender’s punishment has been. Because of his psychiatric condition, extremely limited intelligence and personality deficiencies the 7½ months he has served on remand are likely to have been equivalent in punishment to a significantly longer period of incarceration for the general run of inmates. This has been taken into account by his Honour but not in a way which is transparent in the orders.
	


Sentencing decisions of this Court on s 66C


	
	Cases where this Court has imposed or upheld, for s 66C offences, sentences of similar duration to the sentences fixed by his Honour but without suspension under s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have involved objective seriousness of offending notably greater than in the present case and subjective circumstances less deserving of leniency. In O'Brien v R [2013] NSWCCA 197 the offender was 23 or 24 years old and the victim 14. He pleaded guilty to four counts under s 66C(3). The first three concerned various forms of penetration which all occurred during the course of one incident, the third of these involving penile vaginal intercourse. The sentencing judge nominated indicative terms of 9 months, 3 months and 3 years. Count 4 arose out of an instance of penile vaginal intercourse on a second occasion two or three months after the incident when the first three offences were committed.
	
	
	An aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 5 months was imposed. This took into account a 10% discount for a late plea of guilty. For purposes of comparison with the present case, if a full 25% discount had been allowed the aggregate sentence would have comprised a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 2 months.
	
	
	Thus O’Brien v R concerned offences on two separate occasions against only one complainant. Relative to the present case the much greater seriousness of the offending in objective terms can be seen from the following summary of the facts taken from the sentencing judge’s remarks:
	


“A young girl was exploited for the sexual gratification of a man considerably older than her, a married man with children, a man who knew the family well, a man who clearly planned to exploit this young girl. This was not a momentary aberration. This was a deliberate and calculated course of conduct. Notwithstanding that no violence was used, he clearly overbore the will of this girl - in part because of the long association he had with the family.”


	
	This description highlights by contrast the mitigating circumstances in the present case. It has not been found that the respondent to this appeal engaged in any deliberate or calculated exploitation. The closeness in age of the respondent to each of the complainants and the boyfriend girlfriend relationship which they formed is significant. The respondent’s lack of intelligence and personality deficiencies did not equip him to exploit the complainants, as opposed to forming an age-inappropriate relationship with each of them.
	
	
	Although approximately four years older than each complainant the respondent here was not in any position of trust in relation to them such they would have looked to him as an authority figure. This is significant both to the absence of exploitation of such a relationship and also to the degree of harm inflicted. The present is not a case where complainants have been sexually used by an adult whom they were entitled to regard as a carer. A further point of contrast is that the offender in O'Brien v R did not have a strong subjective case to attract leniency, in contrast with the present respondent.
	
	
	R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103 concerned three offences against s 66C(1) committed over 18 months. The first was sexual intercourse when the complainant was 12 and the offender 19; the second was nearly a year later when the complainant was still 12 years old and the offender had turned 20. The third offence occurred when the victim had turned 13 and was pregnant to the offender. Thus the victim in R v RD was significantly younger than even the complainant in Count 1 in the present case, an age difference of one or two years plainly being material to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of harm occasioned in an offence of this kind. As noted above, most of the offences in the present case were against s 66C(3), with a maximum of 10 years rather than the 16 years maximum which applied to the counts in R v RD.
	
	
	There was no suggestion of any romantic relationship in R v RD. There were simply three instances of the offender taking sexual gratification. He was of below average intellectual functioning and came from a background of significant disadvantage. He had no diagnosable psychological or psychiatric illness. The offender was assessed as being at a moderate risk of further offending.
	
	
	This Court considered that indicative sentences of 2 years and 9 months for each of the first two offences and 4 years for the third would have been appropriate. It substituted for the sentence which had been imposed in the District Court an aggregate term comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months.
	
	
	R v Taane [2014] NSWCCA 330 concerned an offender who had initially committed two offences against the same complainant in June and October 2011, one offence contrary to s 66C(1) and the other contrary to s 66C(3). Suspended sentences of 2 years and 18 months respectively had been imposed in the District Court in June 2012. The offender was 25 years old at the time of the offences. The respondent was 13 at the time of the first offence and 14 at the time of the second. Both the offender and the complainant considered the relationship romantic.
	
	
	Whilst awaiting sentence on these first two counts, during the period April to June 2012, the offender had committed further offences against the same complainant contrary to s 66(3). He carried on his sexual and romantic relationship with her in disregard of an apprehended violence order which restrained him from contacting her. In respect of these further instances of sexual intercourse he was charged with two more offences against s 66C(3) and another two were taken into account on a Form 1. The offender pleaded guilty and was allowed a 25% discount. In the District Court a sentence of 2 years non-parole period with a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months was imposed on the first count. For the second count a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 year 1 month was imposed. Dates of commencement were fixed so that an effective 2 years and 3 months non-parole period was required to be served. This Court declined to interfere on a Crown appeal.
	
	
	It is notable that suspended sentences were imposed for the initial offences, notwithstanding the significant age difference between the offender and the complainant. The offences in respect of which the Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence came before this Court attracted no leniency having regard to the circumstance that they were committed after the offender had been charged with the earlier counts. The complainant had become pregnant as a result of the sexual activity charged in the earlier counts.
	
	
	Each of the individual counts in the present case was less objectively serious than any of the offences in the other cases by a substantial margin and the subjective circumstances of the present applicant were significantly more compelling. Even allowing for the number of counts in the present case and for there having been three complainants, a penalty more severe than that imposed by the learned judge is not required.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Crown has not demonstrated that the Court should refrain from exercising its residual discretion to leave undisturbed the sentences passed in the District Court. I would have the Court exercise that discretion and dismiss Grounds 3 and 4.
	
	
	I propose the order of the Court should be: appeal dismissed.

2701409,State of NSW v Sancar [2016] NSWSC 867,"Judgment


	
	Yuksel Sancar is a 45 year old, Sydney-born man of Turkish background.
	
	
	In 1993, when Mr Sancar was 22 years old, he committed an attempted armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On 10 May 1994, while serving this sentence at the Junee Correctional Centre, Mr Sancar murdered a fellow inmate.
	
	
	In 1998, Mr Sancar was sentenced for the murder in this Court (Ireland J) to a minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years commencing on 27 August 1996 and expiring on 26 August 2011, with an additional term of 5 years commencing on 27 August 2011 and expiring on 26 August 2016. Accordingly, Mr Sancar remains a prisoner who has not been granted parole, but is due to be released in two months on 26 August 2016.
	
	
	By a Summons filed on 24 May 2016, the State of NSW (“the State”) seeks an order pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (“HRO Act”) that Mr Sancar be subject to an Extended Supervision Order for a period of 3 years on and from 26 August 2016. It does not seek that Mr Sancar be made the subject of a continuing detention order.
	
	
	As is usual in applications for such final relief, the State seeks interim relief. Relevantly for the purposes of this judgment, the State seeks the following order:
	


“An order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006:

(a) appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the Court;

(b) directing the defendant to attend those examinations.”


	
	Other interim relief sought by the Summons was not pressed by the State at the hearing before me.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in this judgment, I am not prepared to grant the order sought by the State and, accordingly, I dismiss the application.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	It is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the HRO Act, which provide the context and structure for the determination of this application.
	
	
	Section 4 of the HRO Act defines “violent offender” as “…a person over the age of 18 years who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction for a serious violence offence”.
	
	
	Section 5A of the HRO Act defines “serious violence offence” as follows:
	


“5A Definition of “serious violence offence”

(1) For the purposes of this Act, a ‘serious violence offence’ is a serious indictable offence that is constituted by a person:

(a) engaging in conduct that causes the death of another person or grievous bodily harm to another person, with the intention of causing, or while being reckless as to causing, the death of another person or grievous or actual bodily harm to another person, or

(b) attempting to commit, or conspiring with or inciting another person to commit, an offence of a kind referred to in paragraph (a).

(2) An offence that includes the elements referred to in subsection (1) (a) is a serious violence offence regardless of how those elements are expressed, and whether or not the offence includes other elements.

(2A) A reference in subsection (1) (a) to:

(a) conduct that causes the death of another person with the intention of causing the death of another person includes a reference to murder by an act done (by a person or an accomplice) in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission of, a serious crime, and

(b) conduct that causes the death of another person while being reckless as to causing the death of another person includes a reference to manslaughter caused by an unlawful and dangerous act, and

(c) conduct that causes grievous bodily harm to another person includes conduct that causes the wounding of another person, but only if the conduct was engaged in with the intention of causing the death of another person or grievous bodily harm to another person.

(3) A ‘serious indictable offence’ is:

(a) an offence committed in New South Wales that was a serious indictable offence (within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900 ) at the time that it was committed, or

(b) an offence committed elsewhere than in New South Wales that, if committed in New South Wales, would be a serious indictable offence within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900 at the time that it was committed, or

(c) an offence that, at the time that it was committed, was not a serious indictable offence but which was committed in circumstances that would make the offence a serious indictable offence if it were committed at the time an application for an order against the person is made under this Act.”


	
	This application with respect to Mr Sancar calls for consideration the provisions concerning high risk violent offenders. Section 5E of the HRO Act defines “high risk violent offender” as follows:
	


“5E High risk violent offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk violent offender extended supervision order or a high risk violent offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk violent offender.

(2) An offender is a ‘high risk violent offender’ if the offender is a violent offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious violence offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.”


	
	Section 5F of the HRO Act provides that this Court “may” make an extended supervision order if the offender is a high risk violent offender. Accordingly, the Court’s power to make such an order is discretionary. The State may apply for such an order: s 5H of the HRO Act.
	
	
	Section 5J addresses any such application. It is in the following terms:
	


“5J Application for high risk violent offender extended supervision order

(1) An application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order may be made only in respect of a supervised violent offender.

(2) A ‘supervised violent offender’ is a violent offender who, when the application for the order is made, is in custody or under supervision (referred to in this Part as the offender’s ‘current custody or supervision’ ):

(a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment:

(i) for a serious violence offence, or

...”


	
	The preliminary hearing upon which I am engaged, and the specific orders with respect to the appointment of independent psychiatrists which are sought, are dealt with in s 7 of the HRO Act:
	


“7 Pre-trial procedures

(1) An application for an extended supervision order must be served on the offender concerned within 2 business days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow.

(2) The State must disclose to the offender such documents, reports and other information as are relevant to the proceedings on the application (whether or not intended to be tendered in evidence):

(a) in the case of anything that is available when the application is made, as soon as practicable after the application is made, and

(b) in the case of anything that subsequently becomes available, as soon as practicable after it becomes available.

(3) A preliminary hearing into the application is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow.

(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:

(a) appointing:

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists,

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.

(5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application.”


	
	In light of the requirement in s 7(4) of the HRO Act that this Court consider whether the evidence, if proved, would justify the making of an extended supervision order, it is necessary to have regard to the relevant provisions of s 9 of the Act, which identify the matters to which this Court must have regard in determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order:
	


“9 Determination of application for extended supervision order

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for an extended supervision order:

(a) by making an extended supervision order, or

(b) by dismissing the application.

(2) …

(3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:

(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7(4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f) …,

(g) … ,

(h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit … serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).

(4) In this section, a ‘relevant offence’ means:

(a) …, or

(b) in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order-a serious violence offence.”


	
	Section 12 of the HRO Act provides that a person who fails to comply with an extended supervision order is guilty of an offence, the maximum penalty for which is a fine of $55,000 or imprisonment for five years, or both.
	
	
	Finally, it is appropriate to note that s 21 of the HRO Act provides that the proceedings which are before me are civil proceedings to be conducted in accordance with the law relating to civil proceedings.
	


Applicable Legal Principles


	
	This is a preliminary hearing: s 7(3) HRO Act. The task of the Court at this stage is neither to predict the ultimate result, weigh up the documentation provided, nor consider what evidence a defendant, such as Mr Sancar, might call at the final hearing. Rather, the test is similar to the prima facie test applied by magistrates in committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [98]; State of NSW v Manners [2008] NSWSC 1242 at [8]-[9].
	
	
	It is appropriate at this time to keep in mind that the legislation has two objects: to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and to encourage high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation: s 3 HRO Act; Attorney-General for NSW v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21]; Attorney‑General for NSW v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 873 at [10]; Attorney‑General for NSW v Winters [2007] NSWSC 611 at [7]. It is appropriate at a preliminary hearing to give weight to risk avoidance: Attorney‑General for NSW v Winters [2007] NSWSC 611 at [7].
	
	
	Applying the test in s 7(4) of the HRO Act necessarily requires me to determine, as a central issue, whether the matters in the material before me would, if proven, justify a finding that Mr Sancar is a “high risk violent offender”. I cannot find that Mr Sancar is a “high risk violent offender” unless I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that Mr Sancar poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision: s 5E(2) HRO Act.
	
	
	Mr Sancar accepts that he is a “violent offender” within the meaning of s 5E(2) of the HRO Act. Accordingly, there remain two identifiable questions to be determined before the Court can make the orders sought. The first is whether Mr Sancar “poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision”. The second is whether I am satisfied that such an unacceptable risk exists to “…a high degree of probability”.
	
	
	As to the meaning of “a high degree of probability”, the Court of Appeal in Cornwall v Attorney-General for NSW [2007] NSWCA 374 said this at [21]:
	


“The expression ‘a high degree of probability’ indicates something ‘beyond more probably than not’; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious … offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion ‘likely’ … “.

See also Attorney-General for the State NSW v Tillman at [27].


	
	As to the question of whether Mr Sancar poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence, the expressions “serious violence offence” and “unacceptable risk” require scrutiny.
	
	
	As Button J observed in State of NSW v Lynn [2013] NSWSC 1147 at [16], the expression “serious violence offence” captures a wide range of criminal conduct which is not necessarily “… confined to offences of homicide, or even the intentional infliction of serious violence”. His Honour drew attention to the fact that the definition of “serious violence offence” in s 5A of the HRO Act includes an offence of causing grievous bodily harm to another person where the accompanying intention is only to cause actual bodily harm or where the offender is reckless as to the causing of actual bodily harm.
	
	
	In State of NSW v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118, R A Hulme J considered the meaning of “unacceptable risk” in the context of high risk sex offenders and observed at [16] ff:
	



	
	that a risk may still be an unacceptable risk even though the State does not satisfy the Court that it is more likely than not that a defendant will commit a serious violence offence. As his Honour said: “Put another way, the risk may be less likely than not, but still be an unacceptable risk”; and
	
	
	that a risk would be unacceptable if it was present to a sufficient degree “… so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made”.
	



	
	The Court of Appeal recently considered the meaning of “unacceptable risk” in Lynn v State of NSW [2016] NSWCA 57. Beazley P (with whom Gleeson JA agreed) expressed the following views at 49 ff:
	



	
	the meaning of the phrase “unacceptable risk” raises a question of statutory construction (at [49]);
	
	
	the determination of the existence of an unacceptable risk is an evaluative task, which requires a normative context in which to be made (at [51]);
	
	
	the objects of the legislation may be relevant to the meaning to be given to the provisions of the Act, but those objects cannot control clear statutory language (at [54]);
	
	
	the preferable approach is to give the words their everyday meaning in the context of the provision in which they appear and having regard to the objects of the Act (at [58]); and
	
	
	in the context of the Act, the evaluation being made by the Court is “… directed to the assessment of risk in the context of making the community secure from harm as opposed to guaranteeing its safety and protection” (at [61]).
	



	
	Gleeson JA put the matter succinctly at [148]:
	


“It would subvert the language of the statute if the interests of the offender in liberty and privacy were to be taken into account in the assessment of the threshold of ‘unacceptable risk’ in s 5E(2) of the Act. There is no ‘balancing’ exercise involved in the Court’s assessment of the threshold of ‘unacceptable risk’. “


	
	As his Honour went on to explain, the interests of the offender in liberty and privacy are taken into account at a later stage, when the Court is exercising its discretionary power under s 9 of the HRO Act to either make or refuse to make an extended supervision order.
	
	
	It should also be observed that this Court may make an extended supervision order “if and only if” the offender is a high risk violent offender. As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Attorney-General for NSW v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [34]:
	


“The caution that an order can only be made ‘if an only if’ the Court is relevantly satisfied emphasises the care with which the Court must approach the question of whether to make orders imposing continuing restrictions, in whatever form, on a person’s liberty.”

Evidence


	
	Against those legal principles, and in light of the statutory context, it is appropriate to turn to the evidence led by the State in support of this application. Having regard to the fact that this judgment is dealing with a preliminary application, I approach the evidence on the basis that it will be accepted by the Court hearing a final application.
	


Mr Sancar’s Prior Offending


	
	The index offence qualifying Mr Sancar as a “violent offender” is the offence of murder, which he committed in 1994 and for which he was convicted in 1998.
	
	
	The circumstances of that offence were as follows. On 10 May 1994, whilst Mr Sancar was serving a term of imprisonment at the Junee Correctional Centre, a confrontation occurred between Mr Sancar and his associate on the one hand, and the deceased and another prisoner on the other hand. The occasion for the confrontation was ill feeling arising out of prohibited drug use within the jail. Mr Sancar had been taunted leading up to the confrontation, and his cell window had been broken. The confrontation occurred in a common walkway in the prison. A scuffle ensued, in the course of which Mr Sancar took a homemade jail fashioned knife from his trousers and stabbed the deceased twice in the chest. The deceased died within minutes.
	
	
	At his first trial, Mr Sancar told the jury (which ultimately could not agree on a verdict) that he had been using heroin for about two months prior to the murder, and that he had last taken heroin about two days before the stabbing.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s conduct was described in this way by Ireland J in the course of his reasons on sentence:
	


“The response by the prisoner of inflicting two fatal chest wounds on the deceased is to be seen in the light of the deceased, Mr Weeks, playing a lesser role in the events leading to the confrontation. And this factor together with the fact that the deceased was unarmed constitute aggravating features of the crime.

…

The crime of violent murder by stabbing is one of extreme objective gravity giving rising to a high degree of offence to the general sense of the community.”


	
	The HRO Act did not exist in its current form at the time that Ireland J pronounced sentence on Mr Sancar. His Honour expressed no view with respect to the question of an extended supervision order.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s earlier criminal history commenced when he was just below the age of 15. His offences as a minor consisted of various motor vehicle offences, dishonesty by way of stealing and other low level offences of no present significance. At the age of 16, Mr Sancar was committed to an institution for a period of three months on account of convictions for two offences of common assault.
	
	
	After he became an adult, Mr Sancar committed further theft, driving and motor vehicle offences. In 1993, he was convicted of the offence of attempted armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to a minimum term of 2 years. As I have earlier noted, it was while he was serving this sentence that he committed the murder.
	
	
	None of the offences prior to the index offence would be sufficient to attract the operation of the HRO legislation. To the extent that a pattern of previous offending is disclosed, it is one involving theft or other like offences of dishonesty, and one which indicates a complete disregard for the laws relating to the use of motor vehicles on the road. I do not regard this offending as being at all relevant to whether there is a risk of Mr Sancar committing serious violence offences after his release from jail if he is not kept under supervision.
	


Risk Assessment Report


	
	Mr Sancar was interviewed for approximately 3½ hours on 1 December 2015 by a senior psychologist attached to Corrective Services, Mr Samuel Ardasinski. Mr Ardasinski then prepared a Risk Assessment Report dated 4 December 2015, which he signed. The report was also signed by Danielle Matsuo, a specialist forensic psychologist employed by Corrective Services as the Statewide Manager of Programs.
	
	
	The executive summary of the Risk Assessment Report concluded:
	


“Mr Sancar is assessed as falling in the Medium risk category for violent reoffending, compared with other male violent offenders. Mr Sancar’s behaviour in custody since 1993 has been relatively unstable, with persistent drug use which has delayed his progression through the security classification system. There have been a few acts of violence in custody, although no charges for same in the past 5 years. As he enters the final year of his lengthy sentence, Mr Sancar has not participated in any external leave programs, and has thereby never been considered eligible for parole release.

Mr Sancar is considered treated, as he has participated in a high intensity program aimed at addressing his violence, as well as a further high intensity program aimed at his drug use. He attempted to participate in a pre-release program also aimed at his drug use, but was discharged early from that program in October 2015 for an uncharged act of violence against a fellow participant. …

Should Mr Sancar be considered … suitable for an extended supervision order, this may allow for the gradual reintegration into the community which Mr Sancar has been unable to participate in due to his persistent failures in custody through continuing illicit drug use which have resulted in having his classification progression stalled and regressed. He would be able to access the ongoing support of CSNSW, and related resources to help him to adjust to life in the community after over 23 years in jail.’


	
	Mr Ardasinski pointed out that as it has been over 20 years since Mr Sancar was supervised in the community, it would be “mostly speculative to base predictions on how well he would engage with Community Corrections on his previous performance under community supervision”.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski noted that Mr Sancar had, whilst in custody, continued to be involved with the use, sale and supply of drugs. He pointed out that if Mr Sancar continued his involvement with the use, sale or supply of drugs in the community, then that would potentially cause Mr Sancar to become involved in more serious criminal activity, including violent criminal activity.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski concluded that Mr Sancar had no significant history of mental illness either prior to or during his current sentence. He also noted that Mr Sancar had received relatively positive work reports while in custody.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s principal risk factor was identified as his substance abuse, with heroin being his drug of choice for many years. In the past, Mr Sancar has been placed on the methadone maintenance program whilst in jail. It is apparent that Mr Sancar has been participating in the methadone maintenance program for about the last three months, although this has occurred after Mr Ardasinski completed his report.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski noted that Mr Sancar had participated in, and completed, the Intensive Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program (“IDATP”), which is a prison‑based residential therapy program for male inmates who have a drug or alcohol problem which is linked to their offending behaviour.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s participation in the IDATP was described in positive terms, and he was set a number of targets to achieve during and after the program.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski expressed this view:
	


“Since drug use has been such a critical factor in Mr Sancar’s criminal behaviours, including his violence, for the majority of his adult life, management of substance use will be the most important factor in moderating Mr Sancar’s risk of repeat violence or other crime.”


	
	Mr Sancar commenced, but did not complete, the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (“VOTP”). It is a program of 12 months duration which addresses issues relating to violent offending behaviour and issues surrounding other criminogenic needs including substance abuse and poor literacy skills.
	
	
	Mr Sancar participated in the VOTP for about 11 months, but was removed from the program prior to completion. His removal was apparently related to poor compliance with the program, including a failure to complete his homework, aggressive conduct towards VOTP staff, and general deterioration in his behaviour in prison.
	
	
	Ultimately, Mr Sancar completed the VOTP by independently completing the relevant modules with a psychologist to a satisfactory standard. His progress in the VOTP was recorded as mixed with some definite improvements observed.
	
	
	Whilst in custody, Mr Sancar has also completed a number of other group programs of lesser intensity.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski described Mr Sancar’s current attitude in this way:
	


“Mr Sancar’s current attitude, as expressed in interview, was that he does not think that he is at risk of committing any future acts of violence upon his release to the community. His VOTP-M therapist has suggested that in her discussions with Mr Sancar, which was again reiterated in interview, he has maintained that he has a firm resolve to remain offence-free and live in a pro-social existence post-release.”


	
	Mr Ardasinski noted that it is not scientifically possible to predict accurately whether or not an individual offender will or will not reoffend. He noted that in Mr Sancar’s case, a further challenge in assessing the risk of reoffending was that Mr Sancar had never committed an act of “serious violence” in the community. His only act of “serious violence” was committed whilst in prison. As Mr Ardasinski noted, the environment in prison obviously differs markedly from the community settings in which Mr Sancar would find himself upon release.
	
	
	It is appropriate to record the results of the various risk instruments that were administered to Mr Sancar:
	



	
	On the Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R) criteria, Mr Sancar was assessed as having a score which fell in the medium-high range of risk needs. This was consistent with previous tests using that instrument;
	
	
	The Violence Risk Scale (VRS) Actuarial Risk Assessment resulted in an estimation that Mr Sancar’s risk of being convicted of further violent offences fell in the medium risk range.
	



	
	Mr Ardasinski noted that the VRS assessment compared Mr Sancar’s score to a group of 918 Canadian inmates. He noted:
	


“Of those offenders from this group who obtained a similar score to Mr Sancar, 34.5% were criminally convicted for a new violent offence within 5 years after release into the community … the mean reconviction rate for violent offenders in the sample population was 31.26% within 5 years.”


	
	Mr Ardasinski noted that the reoffending considered in the VRS Assessment, being a “new violent offence”, was not necessarily of the same seriousness as a “serious violence offence” under the HRO Act. Accordingly, he expressed the view that the recidivism rate with respect to “serious violence offences” would be lower than the rate for general violent offences.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski went on to address a series of factors which he regarded as “relevant, primary risk factors” in assessing Mr Sancar’s risk of violent reoffending. These factors included:
	



	
	Mr Sancar’s substance abuse – Mr Ardasinski noted that Mr Sancar needs to participate in the methadone maintenance program, or a similar support program, for the foreseeable future to reduce the risk of becoming involved in illicit drugs.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s antisocial peers and lack of a pro-social lifestyle – Mr Ardasinski noted that Mr Sancar needs a “pro-social peer network” in the community outside of his immediate family in order to develop a lifestyle which is not characterised by drug use or criminal violence. He made no prediction as to whether or not developing such a peer network was feasible.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s institutional identity, weapon use and criminal attitudes – Mr Ardasinski commented that, as a result of his more than 20 years in custody, Mr Sancar has developed a “dangerous person” identity, justified the possession of lethal weapons, and developed cognitive distortions around the need to carry a knife. Mr Ardasinski noted that use of a weapon is associated with an increased risk of criminal violence, and obviously increases the potential for serious harm.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s interpersonal aggression and poor emotional regulation – Mr Ardasinski noted that the potential for interpersonal violence is exacerbated in individuals who struggle to maintain emotional stability. He expressed the view that despite working on his interpersonal aggression and poor emotional regulation skills through participation in a number of relevant programs, Mr Sancar has demonstrated that these are continuing deficits for him.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s aggressive interpersonal style and anti-authority attitudes – Mr Ardasinski noted that such attitudes are associated with an increased risk of criminal violence.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s lack of relationship skills – Mr Ardasinski noted that Mr Sancar has had difficulty building effective intimate relationships, which typically discourage offenders from committing violent crimes.
	



	
	Having reviewed all of the factors, including a number of potential protective factors such as the influence of Mr Sancar’s mother and sister, and his broader family, Mr Ardasinski reached these conclusions with respect to Mr Sancar’s overall risk of violent reoffending:
	


“60.   The overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr Sancar falls in the medium risk category of violent offending relative to other adult male violent offenders. The most serious of violence perpetrated by Mr Sancar was lethal violence, although this was committed in the unique setting of prison custody. He has addressed the factors which resulted in this violence, and he has never committed a serious violence offence in the community.

61.    It is not considered likely that future violence would approach the threshold of a ‘serious violence offence’ as defined in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006.”


	
	Mr Ardasinski recorded that Mr Sancar had expressed the view that after release he would be likely to return to Turkey to undertake National Military Service. Whether or not this is so was not clearly established by the evidence in the proceedings. Even if it were established, it is not a matter to be taken into account at this stage of the proceedings. This is not to say that it could not be taken into account if this Court was ultimately to consider whether to finally make an extended supervision order in the exercise of its discretion.
	
	
	Mr Ardasinski completed a supplementary psychological risk assessment report on 28 January 2016. He was given further additional information, including, in particular, a “Segregation Order Covering Report” dated 30 December 2015. Having carefully considered that additional material, and taking it at its highest, Mr Ardasinski adhered to his initial assessment. He said:
	


“Nothing in the attached material gives me cause to alter my initial assessment which indicated that Mr Sancar was assessed as posing a moderate risk of violent reoffending. The additional material provides further evidence to me that Mr Sancar poses a greater risk of violence within custodial settings and has entrenched anti-authority attitudes which he will likely require intensive support and intervention to manage when he is eventually released to the community.”

Management in the Community


	
	A further report was tendered from Ms Rebecca Kaye, a Community Corrections Officer. It was dated 21 January 2016. The purpose of the report was to identify the extent to which Mr Sancar could reasonably and practicably be managed in the community: see s 9(3)(d1) of the HRO Act. The report usefully describes in considerable detail the steps that would need to be taken to manage and supervise Mr Sancar in the community in the event that the Court made an extended supervision order. Importantly, the report did not suggest that Mr Sancar was unsuitable to be supervised in the community.
	


Mr Sancar’s Custodial History


	
	The State relied to a significant degree on Mr Sancar’s history of misconduct while in custody. There were over 60 recorded instances of Mr Sancar breaching prison discipline.
	
	
	Many of these breaches of discipline were associated with drug use. These included Mr Sancar providing urine tests which tested positive to illicit drugs, or failing to provide urine tests as required. Other breaches included not showing appropriate respect or speaking inappropriately to Corrective Services staff, which were described by Mr Ardasinski as being manifestations of Mr Sancar’s anti-authority attitudes.
	
	
	The State submitted that the Court should have regard to these matters, although it was not required mandatorily to do so under s 9(3) of the HRO Act, because they were relevant to predicting how Mr Sancar would behave if he was released into the community.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s last recorded breaches of discipline connected with violence were in April and June 2005. On those occasions, he was found guilty of intimidation, and received short-term sanctions. Prior to then, Mr Sancar was found guilty of an assault in 2001, for which he was confined to his cell for three days. He was also found guilty of an assault in 1995.
	
	
	In a supplementary pre-release report of 24 February 2016, it was recorded that Mr Sancar’s classification had been “regressed” to B-Medium because of his involvement in “conspiring to introduce contraband into a correctional centre and for organising the assault of other inmates”.
	
	
	The change of classification occurred as a consequence of a report from a Corrective Services Officer who had listened to two telephone conversations in which Mr Sancar had participated in December 2015. The Corrective Services Officer concluded that the contents of the two telephone calls necessitated Mr Sancar being placed in segregation “… for the good order of the Centre and the safety of other inmates”.
	
	
	Recordings of the telephone calls were tendered to the Court, and the Court was invited to listen to them. Counsel for Mr Sancar contended that the calls contained no element of any threat of violence or other misbehaviour.
	
	
	I have listened to the telephone calls. They are hard to decipher and it is difficult, without further information as to whom Mr Sancar is speaking, to discern the true meaning and effect of the words. However, it would not be appropriate, at this preliminary hearing, for this Court to reach a definite conclusion about the meaning of these phone calls. As well, experienced Corrective Service officers are better placed to interpret what is being said.
	
	
	The issue for the Court is whether the material in the telephone calls is capable of giving rise to the conclusion expressed in the covering report that Mr Sancar was conspiring to assault other inmates. In light of the fact that the covering report includes reference to material other than the telephone calls provided to the Court, I am not prepared to conclude that these conversations are not capable of being interpreted as they were in the covering report.
	


Discernment


	
	It is not in dispute that Mr Sancar is a person in relation to whom an extended supervision order can be made by this Court, since he falls within the definition of a “supervised violent offender”: s 5J(1) of the HRO Act.
	
	
	The State submits that the evidence before this Court establishes that:
	


“… [Mr Sancar] has a history of acting violently, has become institutionalised having spent 23 years in jail and is at an unacceptable risk of reoffending if not supervised. It is submitted that the life change such as that required by [Mr Sancar] (remaining abstinent from drugs and realigning his attitude generally) is a gradual process and, without supervision, the risk of the defendant returning to drug use and, thereafter, violence, remains a very real one. Whilst it is largely unknown how well the defendant will perform in the community given he has spent more than half of his life in custody, this uncertainty, and bearing in mind the primary object of the Act, it is submitted that supervision is necessary to ensure the safety of the community.” (sic)


	
	A significant element of the State’s submissions seemed to involve a challenge to the expert opinion expressed by Mr Ardasinski, which I have set out at [58] above. The State submitted that Mr Ardasinski’s conclusion did not reflect a proper understanding of the meaning of “serious violence offence”. The State drew attention to the remarks of Button J in Lynn at [16], where his Honour described what conduct may fall within the definition of a serious violence offence. A careful examination of those remarks, and without any disrespect to his Honour’s reasoning, indicates that his Honour was merely paraphrasing, by reference to examples, the legislative definition of what constitutes a serious violence offence. His Honour’s remarks in no way sought to broaden the conduct which falls within the legislative definition of “serious violence offence”. Mr Ardasinski’s conclusion was expressed by direct reference to the legislation. He is a psychologist who is an expert in this area and there is simply no reason to believe that he did not correctly understand the definition of a serious violence offence, which is not a complex definition. I reject this submission.
	
	
	This Court is engaged in an evaluative task. This evaluative task requires the Court to take into account all of the material that has been placed before it, and to assume that the facts disclosed in that material will be proved at a final hearing. This includes the expert opinions of Mr Ardasinski. Having done so, the Court must then ask itself whether it is satisfied to a high degree of probability that Mr Sancar poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	Unacceptability of risk is a combination of two necessarily predictive elements. The first is the likelihood that the risk will eventuate and the second is the gravity of the risk. As Harrison J observed in State of NSW v Pacey [2015] NSWSC 1983 at [43]:
	


“A very high risk of occurrence of something that is insignificant, or a very low risk of occurrence of something that is significant, are both risks of similar or corresponding proportions, but neither risk could be considered to be unacceptable.”


	
	Having regard to the nature of the material provided to the Court, which largely comprises documents obtained from government records, and Mr Ardasinski’s opinion reduced to writing, it can be assumed without difficulty that the matters disclosed in this material can be proved. The more difficult task is to determine what inferences can be drawn from the material as to the risk that Mr Sancar will commit a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	In the analysis which follows, it needs to be kept in mind that there is not one single piece of the defendant’s history and the evidence, including expert opinions, which is of such significance that it determines the conclusion. Rather, all matters need to be taken into account and evaluated.
	
	
	The starting point is to acknowledge that Mr Sancar has only ever been convicted of one serious violence offence, being the index offence of murder, for which he was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment. By reason of that conviction, Mr Sancar is deemed to be a serious violent offender by the legislation. However, such a description is no more than a label attached to past conduct. It gives no indication as to the likelihood of Mr Sancar committing a serious violence offence in the future. The evaluative task which the Court must now undertake requires an assessment of Mr Sancar’s future conduct. That task is a difficult one, not simply because it is predictive in nature, but because the prediction is to be made in the context of the release into the community of a person who has spent a large part of his adult life in custody.
	
	
	The next relevant matter to consider is Mr Sancar’s disciplinary breaches in prison. It is fair to say that most of these breaches are linked to the use of illicit drugs. Although there are suspicions and reports of violent conduct on the part of Mr Sancar, the last proved breach of discipline involving violence on the part of Mr Sancar was over 10 years ago. As well, in considering these disciplinary offences, it is necessary to keep in mind, as Mr Ardasinski notes, that Mr Sancar has developed a persona of a “dangerous person” and anti-authority figure which he regards as appropriate to ensure his safety and survival in the prison system. The development of this persona is perhaps understandable in light of Mr Sancar’s relatively slight physical stature.
	
	
	There are a large number of disciplinary offences. Of this number, only a few are connected with violence, and even those offences do not suggest violence of a kind that would fall into the definition of “serious violence offences”. I do not think that Mr Sancar’s disciplinary record is of any real probative value in determining his risk of committing serious violence offences in the future.
	
	
	The disciplinary offences do point to the fact that, for many years, Mr Sancar has continued to use illicit drugs. There is no doubt that Mr Sancar’s continued use of illicit drugs after his release would increase the risk of him associating with criminal elements and engaging in violent behaviours associated with drug dealing and in disputes connected with drug dealing. However, the records show that, at least since February 2016, Mr Sancar has participated in the methadone maintenance program, which has the capacity, if he persists in that program, to enable him to avoid illicit drug use. It is also clear that Mr Sancar recognises that his drug use is something which he needs to address in order to transition successfully into the community. The fact that Mr Sancar has such insight is itself a factor to be considered in the assessment of unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Mr Sancar presented well throughout the lengthy interview with Mr Ardasinski. He engaged in the assessment process and was co-operative and polite through the interview session. His current attitude, which he expressed to Mr Ardasinski, was that he did not regard himself at risk of committing any future acts of violence upon his release to the community. That attitude was also expressed to other professionals who provided rehabilitation and treatment courses to Mr Sancar whilst in custody. This expression of intention, whilst relevant, needs to be treated with some caution.
	
	
	Mr Sancar’s length of incarceration, his institutionalisation and lack of a strong peer network in the community outside of his family, suggests that his reintegration into the community will not be risk free.
	
	
	In the evaluative exercise, the opinions of Mr Ardasinski are helpful, and need to be given proper weight. There are two separate conclusions of Mr Ardasinski that are important to identify and take into account.
	
	
	The first is that he does not consider it likely that any future violence engaged in by Mr Sancar would approach the threshold of a “serious violence offence”. Mr Ardasinski seems to base this conclusion upon the circumstances surrounding Mr Sancar’s violent offending in the past. In particular, Mr Ardasinski notes that Mr Sancar’s only serious violence offence, being the index offence of murder, was committed in an institutional environment in circumstances where there was a dispute among prisoners about the sale and supply of drugs.
	
	
	In considering the application of the legislation, it is important to note that the legislation is not addressed to every act of violence which may be committed by an offender released into the community. The HRO Act is concerned with the future commission of “serious violence offences”. That Mr Sancar may commit acts of violence if released is not to the point. The relevant inquiry is the risk that Mr Sancar will commit “serious violence offences”.
	
	
	On one view, Mr Sancar will be less likely to commit a “serious violence offence” once he is removed from a custodial setting. The aggressive persona which Mr Sancar developed in prison, and to which I have earlier referred, will no longer be necessary upon his release into the community. When he is living in the community with the support of his family, Mr Sancar will be less likely to confront situations conducive to the commission of serious acts of violence.
	
	
	The second important conclusion of Mr Ardasinski is that Mr Sancar falls into the medium risk category of violent offending relative to other adult male violent offenders. As Mr Ardasinski noted, only about a third of the sample of Canadian offenders in the medium risk category committed an offence of violence in the first five years after their release from prison. Even then, the concept of a “violent offence” used in that comparison is not necessarily the same as the concept of a “serious violence offence” set out in the HRO Act. Accordingly, this conclusion of Mr Ardasinski does not, of itself and without more, support a conclusion that Mr Sancar poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence.
	
	
	It cannot be ignored, and it is a central feature of this analysis, that the objective of the HRO legislation, and a matter of great importance in this application, is ensuring the safety and protection of the community. The release of any offender from prison carries with it a risk that the offender will commit further offences. The recidivism rates of prisoners in NSW are a recognised and tracked phenomenon. No evidence as to the precise recidivism rate was put before the Court. None was required. The phenomenon is well-known.
	
	
	With his sentence due to expire in just over two months, Mr Sancar has never been released on parole. Accordingly, he has not yet had the opportunity of being supervised in the community. He has not yet had the opportunity of living in the community. He has not received any of the programs or supervision or guidance which is available to prisoners on parole whilst they are in the community. The State accepts that an extended supervision order is not to be used as a substitute for parole. The State accepts that that is not the purpose of the HRO legislation, and that it would be an erroneous application of the legislation to impose an extended supervision order as a substitute for parole.
	
	
	The relevance of the fact that Mr Sancar has not had the benefit of release on parole is that his behaviour in the community, his capacity to adjust to living a normal life, and his capacity to avoid offending again, are simply unknown. Put differently, there is no material concerning Mr Sancar’s past behaviour under supervision in the community which would enable a court to make a confident prediction as to his future behaviour under supervision in the community.
	
	
	As the legislation makes clear, ensuring the protection and safety of the community is not to be achieved by subjecting to extended supervision orders all violent offenders at some risk of committing a further violent offence. It is inevitable that anyone released from custody at the conclusion of their term of imprisonment is at risk of committing an offence.
	
	
	The sole issue for this Court is whether the material tendered in this preliminary hearing is capable of satisfying the Court to a high degree of probability that Mr Sancar poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision.
	
	
	I give the words “unacceptable risk” their ordinary meaning. In so doing, I am not satisfied at all, let alone to a high degree of probability, that on the material available, the Court would be able to conclude that Mr Sancar qualifies as a high risk violent offender. I am not satisfied that the material before me is capable of satisfying the Court that the risk of Mr Sancar committing a serious violence offence if he is not kept under supervision is of such a kind, nature or quality as to constitute an unacceptable risk.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have not been satisfied by the State of NSW that the matters in the supporting documentation provided to the Court would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order in respect of Mr Sancar. It follows that I am not obliged to make orders of the kind set out in s 7(4) of the HRO Act as sought in Order 1 of the Summons in these proceedings.
	
	
	It also follows, pursuant to s 7(5) of the HRO Act, that I am obliged to dismiss the application.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Summons filed 24 May 2016 is dismissed.
	
	
	Order the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs.

2701432,Forti v R [2016] NSWCCA 127,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On Monday, 6 June 2016, the Court heard an application for leave to appeal by Matthew Forti with respect to sentences imposed by Sweeney DCJ in the District Court on 28 August 2015. The sentences, for offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), involved a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 28 August 2015, with an additional term of 10 months imprisonment. Pursuant to that sentence, the applicant was due to be released on 27 August 2016. An application for leave to appeal was not filed until 15 February 2016, with grounds being supplied two weeks later. The principal ground of appeal was that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence of fulltime imprisonment. Given the primary purpose of the appeal, being to avoid a custodial sentence, the delay is unfortunate and was said to have resulted from delays in obtaining a transcript of the judgment on sentence.
	
	
	For reasons explained below, the Court was not satisfied that the judge erred in failing to impose a non-custodial sentence. Nevertheless, the Court was satisfied, by a majority, that the sentence of imprisonment was excessive. Accordingly the Court granted leave to appeal at the hearing, allowed the appeal, set aside the sentence imposed in the District Court and resentenced the applicant to a period of imprisonment involving a non-parole period of nine months (which expired on 27 May 2016) with an additional term of nine months, giving a total period of imprisonment of 18 months.
	


Nature of offending


	
	The nature of the offending was set out clearly and concisely in the reasons of the sentencing judge. It involved three offences and one matter taken into account on a Form 1. The applicant entered an early plea and obtained a 25% discount on sentences otherwise appropriate. The sentencing hearing was brief, the facts surrounding the offending having been agreed.
	
	
	On 1 November 2014 a young woman, who apparently knew the applicant as a potential supplier of “Euro” tablets (being tablets of MDMA or ecstasy manufactured in Europe), obtained four tablets from the applicant for the sum of $240. On the evening of 7 November 2014, she gave two of the tablets to a friend. Each consumed about one and a half tablets at a dance party the following afternoon. The friend suffered a cardiac arrest and died of a “drug overdose” later that afternoon.
	
	
	Three days later (11 November 2014) the applicant sent text messages to the woman who had purchased the drugs, saying in one that he was “about to go assist police with their investigation.” The facts did not indicate that he did so, but the police were aware from the friend of the deceased that the applicant had supplied the MDMA tablets. The young woman was arrested on 23 December 2014 and charged in relation to the supply of the two tablets provided to the deceased. The supply of four tablets constituted the first charge against the applicant.
	
	
	The agreed facts stated that the police obtained authority to intercept the applicant’s telephone service on 9 January 2015 and, between that date and 5 February 2015 intercepted messages and phone calls indicating that the applicant was involved in the supply of MDMA.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 7 February 2015. In a recorded interview with police, he admitted that, on 10 January 2015, he had supplied some MDMA tablets to a number of friends at a party. That supply constituted the second charge.
	
	
	At the time of his arrest, the applicant told police that he had a “pill testing kit” in his car, “some Ritalin” in his pocket and “some caps and a few pills” in his home. He was searched and two Ritalin tablets were discovered in his wallet. Possession of those tablets constituted the offence on the Form 1 which was taken into account in sentencing with respect to the third offence.
	
	
	The police also searched the applicant’s car and found an MDMA drug testing kit. A search of the applicant’s bedroom revealed three MDMA tablets, nine gelatine capsules containing MDMA powder, a container with 49 empty gelatine capsules (the container being marked “contents 100”), one small MDMA tablet and a set of digital scales. The total weight of the MDMA located in the bedroom was 2.3 grams. This quantity was the subject of the third charge of possession for the purposes of supply.
	


Personal circumstances of applicant


	
	The sentencing judge gave careful attention to the applicant’s personal circumstances. She noted that he was a young man, being 19 years of age. (In fact the first offence was committed when he was 18, shortly before his 19th birthday.) He had had no prior contact with the criminal justice system. He commenced using drugs in about February 2014 (that is some nine months before the first offence) and his purpose in supplying drugs was partly to fund his own drug use and partly to cover his living expenses.
	
	
	The sentencing judge summarised his circumstances at the time of sentencing in the following passage: [1] 
	


“He has completed the MERIT program for people who are using drugs and want to stop using drugs. He has stopped using drugs and he has had urinalysis to demonstrate that he has no illicit drugs in his system. He has stopped seeing the people that he was previously associating with that he regarded as having had a negative influence on him. Those significant steps towards his rehabilitation are to his credit. Mr Forti has many positive factors in his favour. He appears to me to be essentially a positive young man who went astray for a while subsequent to a family breakdown. He has now rebonded with his family and resumed a positive life. He is assessed by the author of the Pre-Sentence Report as at low risk of reoffending and I am satisfied that that is an appropriate assessment of him. He has learnt a harsh lesson of the consequences of his behaviour.”

Sentencing considerations


	
	In considering the factors relevant to sentencing, the judge took into account the matters set out above and noted that there had been media coverage of his case, presumably resulting from the death of the young woman. The judge was satisfied that, given the substantial progress by way of rehabilitation, specific deterrence of the applicant was not required. She accepted, however, the need to deter other young people “who are minded to supplying drugs to friends and who do not see it as serious conduct and who do not think of the consequences of their behaviour.” [2]  The judge also stated, in a passage which attracted attention on the appeal, that “the usual principle is that supplying drugs in a substantial way, particularly where there is an element of financial profit, should normally lead to a custodial sentence.” [3] 
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant on sentencing invited the Court to consider a community service order, a suspended sentence or an order for assessment for an intensive correctional order as appropriate non-custodial orders. The judge did not disregard these submissions, stating: [4] 
	


“I have been asked by his counsel to deal with him by way of a sentence other than fulltime custody. Despite his positive personal circumstances, including his prior good character, his pleas of guilty, his acceptance of responsibility and demonstration of contrition, I am of a view that the circumstances of his offences require that he serve some time in fulltime custody.”


	
	The judge accepted that there were special circumstances warranting departure from the statutory prescription of the minimum proportion of the sentence to be served by way of mandatory custody. She decided, appropriately, to deal with the matter by way of an aggregate sentence and indicated that had she imposed individual sentences, they would have been (a) on the first count, 16 months’ imprisonment; (b) on the second count, 12 months’ imprisonment, and (c) on the third count, taking into account possession of the Ritalin tablets on the Form 1, 12 months’ imprisonment.
	


Failure to adopt a non-custodial option


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant noted the statutory prohibition on sentences of imprisonment unless the Court be satisfied that no non-custodial penalty is appropriate. [5]  Further, the Sentencing Procedure Act, by requiring that in imposing a sentence of six months or less, the Court must indicate and record its reasons for deciding that no other penalty is appropriate, reflects the principle that such short terms of imprisonment require explicit justification.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant also referred to the sentencing principle that courts should refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless the gravity of the crime renders such a course necessary. He referred to the reasoning of Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham, [6]  relied upon by McClellan CJ at CL in KT v The Queen. [7]  McClellan CJ at CL also referred to the emphasis to be given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, an emphasis which “may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity”. [8]  Counsel submitted that these considerations warranted the adoption of a non-custodial option. He also submitted that the sentencing judge had not given adequate (or indeed any) reasons for rejecting such an option.
	
	
	It was not true to say that the judge had disregarded non-custodial options: the passage in which she expressly addressed them has been set out at [13] above. The reason for doing so was identified, namely “the circumstances of his offences”. There were in fact two relevant circumstances which had been discussed in considering the objective seriousness of the offences which justified that conclusion.
	
	
	It is convenient to refer first to the statement of the “usual principle” noted at [12] above. Counsel took issue with the proposition that the applicant had been supplying drugs “in a substantial way”.
	
	
	In Wayne William Reid v R [9]  Buddin J referred to “the well-entrenched principle that in the absence of exceptional circumstances a fulltime custodial sentence ought to be imposed whenever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs.” [10]  It has also been explained in Smaragdis v R [11]  by Fullerton J (Simpson and R A Hulme JJ agreeing) that “a plea of guilty, remorse, an intention not to re-offend and proven rehabilitation in relation to an offender’s drug use, even where such circumstances can in combination be described as strong, are not matters of mitigation constituting an exceptional reason for departing from the general principle unless the aggregate of the circumstances point[s] to the case being one of real difference from the general run of cases”. [12] 
	
	
	Care should be taken in using the term “exceptional circumstances” as if it were a statutory prescription requiring definition. It is no more than a handy phrase covering a range of factors which may provide guidance. [13]  Further, what constitutes “substantial” involvement in the supply of drugs and whether such activities may be described as “trafficking” are matters for evaluation in the individual case.
	
	
	There were a number of features of the present case which demonstrated that the applicant had engaged in supply as an ongoing activity over a period of some months. For example, (a) the supply in November 2014 was to a customer who already knew of him as a potential source of MDMA; (b) the admitted supply at a party on 10 January 2015 indicated ongoing selling; (c) the fact that he had ongoing financial needs, including resulting from his own drug use; and (d) the paraphernalia found in the applicant’s car and bedroom on 7 February 2015, including an MDMA drug testing kit, scales and capsules. The judge further accepted that intercepted telephone calls indicated that he was making arrangements to supply MDMA to friends at a party on 7 February 2015, the day of his arrest.
	
	
	The judge made clear how she assessed his involvement in the supply of drugs, stating: [14] 
	


“In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences I take into account that there was not a single, isolated instance of supply, but there were three supplies over a period of about four months. Each supply involved small quantities and the overall quantity supplied was small. Quantity alone does not determine sentence but it is a relevant factor to be taken into account. On the evidence Mr Forti was a low level dealer supplying mostly to friends, but he admitted supplying to other people who knew of his capacity to supply his friends.”


	
	In short, there was no error in the evaluation by the judge of the level of his activities, nor was that assessment inconsistent with the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment was required.
	
	
	The second factor which warranted a sentence of imprisonment was the applicant’s response to the death of the young woman on 8 November 2014. As the judge noted, after hearing of the death, “Mr Forti apologised to the young woman [to whom he supplied the drugs] … but he went on supplying the drug to other people after that event.” [15]  That was a highly material factor and was undoubtedly one of the circumstances taken into account by the sentencing judge in rejecting the possibility of a non-custodial sentence.
	
	
	This aspect of the applicant’s challenge to the sentence imposed must be rejected.
	


Other considerations


	
	The sentencing judge indicated individual sentences of imprisonment for 16 months, 12 months and 12 months in respect of the three offences. The applicant submitted that there was error in failing to allow a significant degree of leniency with respect to the second offence on the basis that the police had no knowledge of his activities in that regard other than through his voluntary admission. Indicating a sentence of the same order as the other offences failed to reflect the principle established in R v Ellis. [16]  That ground of challenge should be accepted; the consequences will be addressed below. (The indicative sentence is no part of the sentence imposed and its correctness or otherwise is not the subject of an appeal.)
	
	
	The applicant also challenged the manner in which the sentencing judge dealt with the first offence. The judge stated, entirely correctly: [17] 
	


“A young woman who took the drug Mr Forti supplied to her friend died. Mr Forti has not been charged with causing her death. Legally he cannot be held responsible for her death and I am not sentencing him for that. His unlawful act was supplying the drug to his friend, who supplied it to the young woman who died.”


	
	All of that was true, but the indicative sentence for the first offence was the lengthiest, namely imprisonment for 16 months. The real significance of the death in the present context was that it should have provided a dramatic warning to the applicant of the error of his ways and should have led him to abandon his activities: it did not. That fact alone warranted a sentence of fulltime custody with respect to the later offending. It did not, however, warrant a lengthier sentence for the first offence. To that extent, there was substance to the applicant’s complaint that the first indicative sentence was excessive. Again, the consequence of that finding will be addressed below.
	
	
	Thirdly, the applicant submitted that inadequate weight had been given to his youth and immaturity. As noted above, the authorities support the view that with a young person in contact with the criminal justice system for the first time, significant weight should be given to rehabilitation, and especially in a case such as the present where there was affirmative evidence of successful progress in that regard. It was submitted that the judge failed to give proper weight to that consideration and, allowed the factor of general deterrence undue weight.
	
	
	Taken by itself, this would not have amounted to error. It was clear that the sentencing judge was fully aware of the steps taken by the applicant and treated them favourably. There is, however, a question as to how such a consideration should have been reflected in the indicative sentences and the final aggregate sentence.
	
	
	There is another factor to be considered. Despite statements by this Court that substantial involvement in the supply of drugs will usually give rise to a custodial sentence, the JIRS statistics indicate otherwise. Thus, sentences in the higher courts (thus excluding the Local Court) from October 2008 to September 2015 for a principal offence involving the supply of ecstasy (including deemed supply) in an amount less than the commercial quantity, where there were multiple offences, but offenders with no prior history and having pleaded guilty, were as follows. Ninety-three cases were identified of which only 17 (18%) resulted in sentences of imprisonment. Two-thirds involved suspended sentences, community service orders or bonds. (The other 18% were intensive correction orders, periodic detention and home detention.) When the figures are further refined to cover only offenders between the ages of 18 and 20 years, the percentage imprisoned falls to 5%, from a pool of 41 cases.
	
	
	Whilst these statistics do not reveal the range of conduct involved, nor the personal circumstances of the offenders, they are nevertheless troubling in that they demonstrate that the sentence imposed on the applicant is undoubtedly of a kind restricted to a small percentage of offenders. Indeed, and perhaps surprisingly, when the criteria of multiple offences, no prior convictions and guilty pleas are removed, the statistical distribution (not limited to 18-20 year olds) is hardly varied, despite the fact that the pool then contains 740 cases.
	


Resentencing


	
	The considerations set out above indicate that there should be a grant of leave to appeal in the present case.
	
	
	The next question is whether these circumstances permit the Court to intervene so as to vary the aggregate sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. By reference to the matters discussed above, intervention is appropriate for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the starting point for the sentence (before the discount for pleas) was approximately two years five months. That in itself is a significant sentence for a first offender. Given that only 5% of first offenders in the applicant’s age bracket are sent to gaol, such a sentence would appear to be at the very top of the range, if not excessive.
	
	
	Secondly, if the first indicative sentence should have been in the order of 12 months and the second sentence (subject to the Ellis discount) should have been of the order of eight months, even accepting that those figures are the subject of a 25% discount, there is nevertheless, a high degree of accumulation, suggesting that the sentence imposed was excessive.
	
	
	Thirdly, taking into account the small amounts of the drug involved, the positive steps by way of rehabilitation and the accepted assessment of a low likelihood of reoffending, in combination with the first two factors, demonstrate that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
	
	
	It follows that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge should be set aside. The next step is for this Court to resentence the applicant.
	
	
	Allowing for the 25% discount for the plea of guilty, the sentence indicated for the first offence should be reduced from 16 months to 12 months. The indicative sentence for the second offence (subject to the Ellis discount) should be reduced from 12 months to eight months. There should be no variation of the third indicative sentence of 12 months.
	
	
	To reflect the ongoing activity of supply in circumstances following the death of the young woman in November 2014, those sentences would attract a significant degree of accumulation. An aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 18 months should be imposed. (That reflects a starting point of two years imprisonment, prior to the discount for the pleas.) The finding by the trial judge of special circumstances should be confirmed, for the reasons which she gave. Given the satisfactory steps already taken by way of rehabilitation and the strong desirability of encouraging that process, a non-parole period of nine months’ imprisonment should be imposed, with an additional term of nine months.
	


Conclusion


	
	For these reasons I supported the orders made by the Court at the hearing on 6 June 2016.
	
	
	ROTHMAN J: I agree with Basten JA.
	
	
	FAGAN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three offences of supplying prohibited drugs (namely MDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy) contrary to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and was sentenced by her Honour Judge Sweeney in the District Court on 28 August 2015. Particulars of the respective charges were as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 concerned the actual supply on about 1 November 2014 of four tablets of MDMA. The weight of the tablets is said to have been about 0.88g and the sale price was $240, $60 each.
	
	
	Count 2 was also particularised as an actual supply, on about 10 January 2015, of “some tablets” of MDMA. The applicant received payment for these drugs but the amount is not disclosed in the agreed facts which were before the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Count 3 was a case of deemed supply. On 7 February 2015 police searched the applicant’s home and seized total of 2.3 g of MDMA in the form of four tablets and nine 9 capsules which contained the drug as powder.
	



	
	The maximum penalty for each offence is 15 years imprisonment. In sentencing for Count 3 the learned sentencing judge was asked to take into account an additional offence of possession of two tablets of Ritalin, an amphetamine which is commonly prescribed for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder but which is prohibited in the absence of a prescription. Although taking this offence into account required that the sentence on Count 3 should be greater than it would otherwise have been, the difference would not be very substantial. The indicative sentences nominated by her Honour, as required by s 53A(2)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), were 16 months on Count 1 and 12 months for each of Counts 2 and 3.
	
	
	I respectfully agree with Basten JA that her Honour did not err in “failing to deal with the applicant otherwise than by way of a full-time custodial [sentence]” (ground 1). I concur in his Honour’s reasons for rejecting this ground, as given at [16] – [25].
	
	
	Ground 2 is that her Honour erred in failing to discount the sentence for the second count in accordance with the principle stated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 by Street CJ at 604, as follows:
	


“Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.

The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.”


	
	The agreed facts upon the basis of which sentence was passed in the present case made very clear that the commission of the offence charged in Count 2 became known to police only through the applicant having disclosed it to them during an interview following his arrest on 7 February 2015. The principle in R v Ellis was engaged. The learned sentencing judge referred (at RoS 4) to the way in which police had learned of the second offence. Her Honour’s indicative sentence of 12 months for an offence which was in every other respect closely comparable with Count 1 (for which 16 months was indicated) is only consistent with her Honour having allowed a 25% reduction on the principle in R v Ellis.
	
	
	It has been held in CMB v Attorney-General for NSW [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308 at [40] – [43] and [70] – [73] that s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act now embodies and gives effect to the principle in R v Ellis. In Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [32] – [33] Adams J cited previous decisions of this Court in which the view had been taken that s 23 only applied to assistance to authorities in respect of offences committed by persons other than the informant and not to the situation which was considered in R v Ellis of the informant providing information about his own crimes. Those decisions were not referred to in the judgments in CMB v Attorney General for NSW but the High Court’s holding that s 23 applies is clear enough.
	
	
	The significance of s 23 being engaged is that it requires by subs (4) that a sentencing judge’s remarks should explicitly disclose what the sentence would have been but for the discount for assistance. Her Honour’s failure to do this was a specific error which requires that this Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. As held in Panetta v R at [35] – [36], the combined effect of ss 23(6) and 101A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not relieve the Court of this duty.
	
	
	Ground 3 is that her Honour failed “to apply the appropriate sentencing principles for [a] youthful offender”. The applicant committed the first offence just before his nineteenth birthday and the other two within the next three and a half months. I respectfully agree with Basten JA’s conclusion at [29] and [30] that error is not shown in this respect. Her Honour was well aware of the applicant’s age and considered it specifically at RoS 6 and again at RoS 8, where she noted that “his rehabilitation is substantially advanced”. This was a reference to his having completed a drug use rehabilitation program conducted by the Royal North Shore Hospital for which he was commended with respect to his “high level of engagement and compliance” (quoted from his presentence report).
	
	
	Ground 4 is that her Honour “placed too much weight on general deterrence”. I also consider that this ground is not made good. Her Honour said at RoS 8:
	


“Because of the importance of general deterrence in sentencing people for supplying drugs, the usual principle is that supplying drugs in a substantial way, particularly where there is an element of financial profit, should normally lead to a custodial sentence.”


	
	This was a correct statement of principle in accordance with R v Clark (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 March 1990, unrep) and the many subsequent decisions of this Court which have cited that authority. A number of these cases were cited by Fullerton J in Smaragdis v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 276 at [30] – [31].
	
	
	Ground 5 is that the aggregate sentence of 12 months with a balance of term of 10 months was manifestly excessive. I do not consider that it was. Approaching the case as one suitable for the imposition of an aggregate sentence, it is necessary to take account of the circumstance that each of these offences was not to be considered alone but on the basis that together they constituted a course of conduct in an established, ongoing business of supplying prohibited drugs.
	
	
	The degree to which the applicant was entrenched in this business is shown by the fact that he persisted in it undeterred by the knowledge that an end user had died as a result of using one or more of the tablets supplied by him in the commission of the first offence. Three and a half months later, in early February 2015, he was in possession of items which indicated the continuance of this supply business as an organised venture: a small quantity of MDMA tablets and powder, empty capsules capable of being filled with MDMA powder and a drug testing kit for MDMA.
	
	
	A proportionate relationship between indicative sentences such as that nominated by her Honour would be appropriate to this case. It has been mentioned that the indicative penalty for Count 2 should be less than that for Count 1 because of the R v Ellis discount. Count 3 would also warrant a sentence less than that for Count 1 because the third count was a deemed supply, no actual transaction in the drugs which were found on the applicant’s premises having taken place at the date of execution of the search warrant which led to this charge being laid.
	
	
	Consideration of other sentencing decisions for contraventions of s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act where small quantities of MDMA have been involved shows that, when account is taken of the aggravating circumstance that the applicant was engaged in a business of supply, indicative sentences of the order nominated by her Honour were appropriate. Those indicative sentences would fulfil the requirement that repetitive offending as part of a sustained and organised course of activity, be punished more severely than isolated infringements: R v J.R.D. [2007] NSWCCA 55 at [29]; Einfeld v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1 per Basten JA (with whom Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) at [146]; Lago v R [2015] NSWCCA 296 at [49]. In this area of the criminal law, particularly, repetition of supply offences is significantly aggravating.
	
	
	In Chiang v R [2016] NSWCCA 45 this Court considered a sentence of six months plus a balance of term of three months appropriate to a single count relating to 24 MDMA tablets weighing 7.1g. The Court’s decision was made on the basis that the tablets were all in possession for supply to friends of the offender but that he had no profit motive. He had no prior convictions, was aged 25 years, had pleaded guilty and had expressed remorse. He was allowed a 25% discount for his plea.
	
	
	Comparison with the present case requires recognition that the present applicant committed three offences with small quantities as opposed to one in Mr Chiang’s case, that two of the applicant’s offences were of actual supplies whereas Mr Chiang’s was a deemed supply and that all three counts in this appeal were part of an ongoing business whereas Mr Chiang’s offence was in isolation. The applicant here acted pursuant to a motive of profit whereas it was accepted in Chiang v R that the offender did not. The applicant admitted that he supplied drugs to fund his own drug use and to support his living and educational expenses. His commitment to such an illegal business, as an integral aspect of his economic arrangements for the pursuit of his own objectives and lifestyle, places each of his offences in a significantly worse category than Mr Chiang’s deemed supply of his friends at no profit on one occasion.
	
	
	In Nguyen v R [2009] NSWCCA 112 the offender was in possession of 27 tablets weighing 6.35g, which he held for supply. No supply actually took place. The offender was apparently young but his age is not given in the Court’s reasons. A severity appeal was considered on the basis that he intended to supply the tablets “to the public in general”. The reasons do not spell out his subjective circumstances but there is no indication that he had any prior convictions or that there was anything else in his antecedents which denied him leniency.
	
	
	This Court considered that the offender in Nguyen v R intended to profit by the sale of the drugs and rejected his claims to the contrary. He had pleaded guilty and it may be inferred that he was sentenced on the basis of a 25% discount. A sentence of 6 months non-parole period with a balance of term of 12 months was not disturbed. Each of the offences of the applicant under consideration in the present case was significantly more serious than the one instance in Nguyen v R because the applicant’s offences were part of an ongoing business.
	
	
	In  Braithwaite v Regina [2005] NSWCCA 451 a 21 year old offender pleaded guilty to one count of supplying MDMA and one count of supplying methamphetamine, both committed on 20 August 2004. The MDMA count concerned 47 tablets weighing 17.78g. The methamphetamine was in 24 doses with a total weight of 20.89g. A 25% discount was allowed for pleas of guilty. The offender was in possession of scales and $540 in cash.
	
	
	On appeal this Court considered that the sentencing judge had erred in declining to give significant weight to the offender’s youth and immaturity. Allowing the appeal a sentence of 8 months non-parole period and a balance term of 16 months was imposed for the MDMA offence (total 2 years) and 6 months non-parole period plus 12 months balance of term (total 18 months) for the methamphetamine charge. They were to be served concurrently. The point of distinction between these two offences and three counts to which the applicant pleaded is the time span: a single date in Braithwaite v Regina compared to an ongoing entrenched business conducted by the applicant, of which the three counts under consideration on this appeal were manifestations.
	
	
	When comparison is made between the present applicant’s offences and the charges considered in the three cases cited, the applicant’s offences in my view individually warranted indicative sentences of the order which her Honour nominated. The indicative terms involve an appropriate degree of additional severity, relative to the other cases, to reflect the margin of greater criminality in the applicant’s course of repetitive drug supply. The aggregate which her Honour ultimately imposed, 12 months with a balance of term of 10 months, was an appropriate and justifiable penalty derived from the three indicative terms.
	
	
	I have considered the sentencing statistics supplied by the applicant but I find them to be of no assistance. The statistics beg a number of questions: “What were the objective facts of the cases dealt with by full-time custody in the statistical count? What were the facts of the cases dealt with more leniently?” and so on. I do not consider that such statistics provide any usable shortcut which would circumvent the necessity to make comparison with other sentencing decisions in which similar quantities of drugs and like subjective circumstances of offenders have been involved, for the purpose of achieving consistency and relativity. By relativity I mean a proportionately heavier penalty for more serious offending, relative to other decisions of the Court.
	
	
	For these reasons whilst accepting that a specific error in sentencing occurred as a result of her Honour’s failure to nominate the amount of discount given for the applicant’s self-incrimination on Count 2, I would arrive at the same result as her Honour and would therefore grant leave but dismiss the appeal.

2701434,R v Colless [2016] NSWSC 931,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the third sentence of para 11 of the statement of the proposed Crown witness, Mr Max Harris, of 20 March 2015. In order to clarify whether what is contained in that sentence was based on direct observation or hearsay, the witness was briefly examined by each party on the voir dire, with my concurrence.
	
	
	It was explained by senior counsel for the accused, after that evidence was received, that it is accepted that the evidence passes the test in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) of relevance, though, it was said, barely. But it was said that there is a prejudice that accrues to the accused in that, to the extent that it seems that Mr Harris will speak of himself proposing to “sort it out” (in the first sentence of para 11), if the jury has an incomplete picture of what the accused said and did after an alleged harassment incident, (according to what Mr Harris says he observes) then that could cause prejudice to the accused: s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I respectfully disagree with that submission.
	
	
	To my mind, the parties are at one that these alleged incidents of harassment before the fatal event are relevant to a number of issues that have been joined between the Crown and the accused, and the response of the accused is relevant to those issues as well.
	
	
	To my mind, simply because Mr Harris may not be able to give a thoroughly complete picture of the acts of the accused immediately after one of these incidents is of no great moment.
	
	
	Similarly, if it be the case that Mr Harris heard the accused use the phrase “sort it out” thereafter, that, to my mind, does not accrue prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	It goes without saying that each party will be fully entitled to address the jury as to what, if any, inferences they would or would not be able to draw from Mr Harris’s seemingly incomplete version of what the accused said and did.
	
	
	Accordingly, I do not propose to reject the evidence, now that it has been clarified on the voir dire.

		05 July 2016",2016-06-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701440,R v May [2016] NSWSC 820,"Judgment


	
	On 6 June 2016 the accused, Jamie May, was arraigned before me on an indictment that charged him with an offence contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) that:
	


On 11 April 2014, at Redfern in the State of New South Wales, did murder Judith Townsend.


	
	The accused entered a plea of not guilty to that charge.
	
	
	The accused had elected to be tried by a judge alone pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), and the Crown agreed to that course. Being satisfied that the accused received appropriate legal advice prior to making the election, and bearing in mind the Crown’s consent, I was obliged to make an order for the trial to proceed in that way: s 132(2).
	
	
	The accused did not dispute much of the evidence adduced by the Crown, and a considerable portion of it was tendered to the Court in the form of written statements made by witnesses. Some witnesses were called to give oral evidence. A number of documentary exhibits were tendered, and the Court attended the scene of the alleged crime to view the area pursuant to s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	


The Crown Case

Overview of the Crown Case


	
	The deceased, Mrs Judith Townsend, was the accused’s maternal aunt. She lived in a block of units in Redfern Street in Redfern.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the accused approached his aunt as she walked in the street near her home late on the evening of 11 April 2014. It is alleged that he assaulted her in front of a unit block in Morehead Street at Redfern by striking her numerous blows to the head and face with a brick, and that he did so with the intention of killing her or causing her grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Mrs Townsend died soon after from the injuries occasioned to her.
	


The Evidence Adduced by the Crown


	
	Much of the evidence relied upon by the Crown was tendered to the Court as Exhibit B1 – 55, together with other documentary exhibits. There was additionally oral evidence. Whilst I have considered all of the evidence, what follows is an account of the more significant parts of that evidence.
	


Civilians at the Scene


	
	Ralph Townsend was the deceased’s husband and he lived with her in a ground floor unit in an apartment block in Redfern Street, Redfern. His statement is in evidence as Ex B1.
	
	
	In the early afternoon of 11 April 2014, at about 1pm or 1.30pm, the accused came to the Townsend flat and knocked on the door, calling out “It’s Jamie.” Mrs Townsend did not open the door, but called to the accused, “We’re getting ready to go out. We’re in a hurry and I can’t let you in.” The accused called back, “Alright, see you later.”
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Townsend left their home soon after, returning at about 6.15pm.
	
	
	After the couple had watched the news and a current affairs program, they began watching a football game on television. Their neighbour from upstairs in the unit block, Margaret Williams, came to their unit whilst the football was on. Soon after, another neighbour, Kantarli O’Reilly, came to the Townsend unit and told the occupants that, “Jamie is holding the girl, Ashanti, by the hair with a knife to her throat.” She left again.
	
	
	Five minutes later the accused came to the Townsends’ door and knocked and then kicked at the door. He called “Let us in, let us in.” Mr Townsend looked through a security peephole and saw that the accused was at the door. He was naked. The door was not opened for him and he walked off.
	
	
	After the football game on television had finished, Mr and Mrs Townsend left their unit to go for a walk. Ms Williams also left the unit, going upstairs to her own unit. She quickly came back down the stairs to report that her door had been kicked in. When Mr Townsend went upstairs to check the unit for his neighbour, he entered a bedroom in the unit and saw the accused, naked, lying on top of a woman on a bed, and apparently having sexual intercourse with her. He left the unit immediately and told Ms Williams what he had seen.
	
	
	He and Mrs Townsend left the apartment block to go for a walk.
	
	
	During the course of their walk, Mr Townsend left his wife for a short time in the company of another neighbour and went to run an errand. When he next saw his wife she was lying on the ground beneath the front windows of a block of units in Morehead Street, severely injured. Mr Townsend saw the accused in the entrance to the unit block moving a cupboard. He was still naked.
	
	
	Mr Townsend called for a passer-by to call an ambulance, and police arrived soon after and tried to assist Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	Margaret Williams (statement, Ex B3) was woken from sleep by a visitor to her apartment, located upstairs from the Townsend flat. She got out of bed to see the accused in her lounge room. He was dressed in white shorts and top, a hat and Nike TN shoes. He told her, “I don’t feel too well Aunty.” When she asked if he had taken something, the accused responded, “Yeah, some pot.” Ms Williams went back to bed, leaving the accused with her son, Joshua Skartados, and her neighbour, Kantarli O’Reilly.
	
	
	She got up soon after and, feeling uncomfortable because of the accused’s presence, decided to go to the Townsend flat. She thought the accused was acting “oddly” ([11]). As she left she told the accused to go and lie down in her bed as it might make him feel better. She saw her son run from the unit. She left the unit. She sat downstairs with the Townsends for some time and then went to visit another friend. That friend, Kariena Brown (statement, Ex B18) recalls Ms Williams saying, “Can I come in because Jamie is over home and he is off his head on drugs” ([4]).
	
	
	When Ms Williams returned to her unit later that night, it had been declared a crime scene by police.
	
	
	Joshua Skartados (statement, Ex B4) recalls the accused coming to his mother’s unit at around 7pm on 11 April 2014. He spoke with the accused for about an hour, during which time he thought the accused was “typical Jamie, calm” ([5]). He didn’t seem to be affected by alcohol or drugs and appeared happy. At some point the accused told Mr Skartados, “I had a cone, I feel a bit funny.” From that point the accused became “very weird” with a strange look in his eye ([5]).
	
	
	His conduct began to worry Mr Skartados; he stood towering over him saying “Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh” ([6]). He began to walk around in circles. Mr Skartados called to his mother to come and speak to the accused before leaving the unit. He said the accused was not aggressive, just “weird.”
	
	
	Jazmena Williams (statement, Ex B5) was staying with Joshua Skartados. She was at his unit on 11 April 2014. She recalls the accused arriving at the unit between 7 and 8 o’clock that night, and saying, “I just had some pot and I feel funny” ([5]). There was some interaction between him and others in the unit.
	
	
	After Mr Skartados had left, Jazmena Williams was in Mr Skartados’ bedroom with a friend, Beatrice, when the accused walked into the bedroom. He had a knife in his hand that was from the kitchen. He held the knife out to the two women saying, “I just gotta do it, I gotta do it” ([9]). He took hold of Beatrice by the hair and held the knife to her back. The accused then dragged Beatrice into the main bedroom. He told Jazmena Williams that she would be next, but she ran from the unit as soon as he went into the main bedroom.
	
	
	Jazmena Williams ran upstairs to a neighbouring unit. Some minutes later, she looked out of the window and saw the accused, naked apart from the Nike TN shoes he had been wearing, walk out of the building, along the footpath on Redfern Street, and turn into Morehead Street. She lost sight of him.
	
	
	Kantarli O’Reilly (statement, Ex B6) lived in a top floor unit of the same block as the Townsends. She knew the accused.
	
	
	On 11 April 2014 she visited Margaret Williams in her unit and saw the accused there. She thought he wasn’t himself; he was quiet and looked “spaced out” ([7]). Without warning, the accused got up from where he had been sitting and grabbed her by the arm. He pulled Ms O’Reilly from the unit and upstairs towards her unit. When she told him they couldn’t get in to her unit as her keys were downstairs he released her, and Ms O’Reilly went downstairs again. The accused came from behind and grabbed her right arm, twisting it and hurting her. She told him he was hurting her and he released her. When she commented to him that his eyes were red and he looked “stoned” the accused said, “I had a cone, I don’t feel right” ([9]).
	
	
	Ms O’Reilly watched as the accused walked around the unit mumbling things she could make no sense of. When she got him some grapes to eat the accused dropped the food on the floor. He stood up saying, “I just gotta do it, I just gotta do it” ([11]), and began rummaging in the kitchen drawers. Ms O’Reilly became concerned; she noticed that, “He had a really weird look on his face; it was like he was looking straight through and he was possessed” ([11]).
	
	
	She went out to look for Mr Skartados, who had gone and, on her return, she saw that the accused had hold of Beatrice Haines by the hair and was threatening her with a knife. Ms O’Reilly ran out of the flat down the stairs calling out that she was going to call police. She heard the deceased call to her, “Don’t go calling the police” ([12]). Instead of calling the police, she waited for a time and then went to check on Beatrice.
	
	
	In the bedroom of Margaret Williams’ flat she saw the accused, naked and with a partially erect penis, pushing himself up from the bed. She could not see Ms Haines because her view was substantially obstructed by the bedroom door. When the accused said, “you get in here too” ([14]) she ran out of the apartment block and stayed elsewhere that night.
	
	
	Rodney Warne (statement, Ex B2) lived in the flat opposite Mr and Mrs Townsend and knew them well. He also knew the accused well as the accused was a regular visitor to the unit block.
	
	
	Mr Warne fell asleep in his lounge room late on 11 April 2014, he thought at about 10pm. Some time later he was awoken by the sound of two male voices yelling. He heard footsteps going down the stairs of the unit block. He then heard a voice he recognised as the accused’s demanding to be let into the Townsend flat. Mr Warne thought the accused sounded agitated. He was punching and kicking at the door of the Townsend flat. Eventually, he went outside the unit block, walking around it whilst calling, “Let me in you cunts,” and similar ([7]).
	
	
	Mr Warne went back to sleep but was again woken, this time by the sound of Mr Townsend saying, over and over again, “My baby is dead”.
	
	
	Dimitri Kouznetsov (statement, Ex D) drove to the area of Morehead Street at about 9.30 on the evening of 11 April 2014 to take his dog for a walk in a nearby park. He parked his car in Redfern Street. He saw a girl walking on Morehead Street, and then a man coming out of some unit blocks opposite to where his car was parked. The man was naked and waving his hands about and acting strangely. He did not see any injuries to the man’s face or any blood on him. The man was talking to himself but he did not catch what he said.
	
	
	The man walked out of the unit block at a fast pace. The girl was also moving at a fast pace. The man, who was still talking, caught up to the girl and placed an arm around her shoulders. It wasn’t an aggressive gesture and he didn’t seem to be restraining the girl. The girl didn’t pull away or do anything to suggest to Mr Kouznetsov that he should call the police. The girl and the man kept walking, away from Mr Kouznetsov, and around the corner into Morehead Street. After a few minutes (as much as five: T22) he heard a very loud high-pitched scream.
	
	
	Lydia Clarke, whose statement is Ex B10, was visiting the Redfern area that night from Taree. She was walking with her cousin, Alicia Donovan, south along the footpath in Morehead Street on her way to visit a friend. It was dark.
	
	
	Ms Clarke saw an aboriginal woman of small stature emerge from a block of units in Morehead Street and walk quickly out onto the street. She saw a man walk out of the same doorway almost immediately behind the woman. The man was about 6 feet tall, bald, aged 30 to 40, and well-built with solid arms. He was naked. The woman glanced once behind her. The man was immediately behind the woman. Ms Clarke did not hear any conversation.
	
	
	Ms Clarke saw the man bend down and pick something up; she thought the object was a stick, a brick, or a rock. He followed the lady. The two disappeared from Ms Clarke’s view.
	
	
	Annie Maguire gave evidence before the Court on 7 June 2016. She had been in a taxi in Redfern when she saw a naked man on Morehead Street sometime soon after 9.45pm on 11 April 2014. The naked man was hugging a female who was much smaller than the man with his arms wrapped around the female’s head and neck area. The woman did not appear to be hugging the male back but had her hands up to her chest. The woman’s back was to Ms Maguire, but she could see the man’s face and head as the taxi in which she was travelling slowly drove by. She did not see any blood or sign of injury to the man’s face although she had a good view of his face.
	
	
	Lolli Daniels (statement, Ex B12) was walking home to Walker Street, Redfern with her partner Michael Binge at around 10pm. They walked onto Morehead Street intending to take a pathway to Walker Street. She saw a man naked but for a pair of joggers standing in the front of 36 Morehead Street with his back to the road and Ms Daniels. She heard the man say, “You’re not my fucking aunty, you’re not my aunty.” Ms Daniels then saw that the man had hold of an aboriginal woman whom she described as tiny, thin, and in her fifties.
	
	
	The man was holding the woman in the area of her throat and shoulder and was punching her in the face with his right hand. The woman was positioned with her back against the wall of the building and was moaning. Her head was going backwards against a steel grate over a window with every blow.
	
	
	Ms Daniels went up to the man and hit at him with her handbag. She yelled at him to “Get off her, stop it” ([6]). The man was “zoned in” on the woman and did not desist. Ms Daniels saw him hit the woman at least six to ten times, and saw that the woman’s face was covered in blood. She was close enough to the pair to see that the man had abrasions and blood on his face under one eye.
	
	
	Ms Daniels saw the man strike a particularly forceful blow to the woman’s face and let her go. The woman fell to the ground where she lay unmoving. The man walked into the rear yard of 36 Morehead Street and went into the unit block and up the back stairs.
	
	
	After going to the nearby home of friends, Ms Daniels went to check on the lady and saw that she was terribly injured. Her partner phoned for an ambulance.
	
	
	Michael Binge (statement, Ex B13) was with Ms Daniels when they saw a naked man in front of a unit block in Morehead Street. The man was with an elderly aboriginal woman who was standing beside the man. Mr Binge heard raised voices and heard the man say, “You’re not my aunty, you’re not my aunty” ([5]). The woman did not reply.
	
	
	Mr Binge saw the man grab the woman by her arm and begin punching her in the face; he saw about eight blows before Ms Daniels ran over and began swinging her handbag at the man and screaming at him. Mr Binge pulled her away. He saw the woman fall to the ground without doing anything to break her fall. After she hit the ground she did not move.
	
	
	Mr Binge went with Ms Daniels to a friend’s flat nearby and returned with them to the scene, whereupon he called the Triple 0 emergency number.
	
	
	Staci Harmer (statement, Ex B14) lived in a unit in Morehead Street. After going to bed on the night of 11 April 2014, she heard yelling from the street. The voices were those of a man and a woman and they were screaming at each other. She and another occupant of the flat, Thomas Kinross, got up and went to the windows looking out to Morehead Street.
	
	
	Ms Harmer saw a man and a woman standing inside the fence line of one of the unit blocks yelling at a man who was naked. The man and the woman then walked away and Ms Harmer noticed that the naked man was holding a rock about the size of a grapefruit. He was down on one knee on the ground and was banging the rock (she thought) into the ground. The man then moved so that he was on both knees and continued to strike the rock into the ground, Ms Harmer thought about ten times.
	
	
	Ms Harmer moved to another window to get a better view and saw that the man was bringing the rock down onto a body lying there, “aiming at the head” ([13]). She saw him hit the body another four times. She telephoned Triple 0. The man continued to strike the body with the rock.
	
	
	As she was on the phone, the man got up from the ground and walked into one of the unit blocks on Morehead Street. He did not have the rock in his hand. She saw him running up the stairs of the building.
	
	
	Police arrived and she later saw some officers bringing the naked man out of the building she had seen him go into. She saw that the rock was lying in the street near the body.
	
	
	Two calls to the Triple 0 line were logged, the first being at 10.12pm (T139:36).
	
	
	Ricky Emmerton lived in a unit block across the road from 36 and 38 Morehead Street. On the evening of 11 April 2014, he heard two male voices and a female voice in that area. A male voice made a grunting sound and there were some scuffling sounds, like a fight. He did not look out as fighting is common in the area.
	
	
	Thomas Kinross (statement, Ex B15) heard yelling from a male voice and a female voice and then saw a man and woman walking along Morehead Street. He saw a naked man who was walking in the direction of the couple. The man turned around and walked in the opposite direction before getting down on his knees on the ground underneath the windows of a Morehead Street unit block. He lifted something up above his head and struck the object down to the ground about five times. After he stopped watching, Ms Harmer called out to him that there was a body, and he again looked from the window. He saw a body in the area where he had seen the naked man striking the ground.
	
	
	Kim Gumley (statement, Ex B20) lived in a unit at 38 Morehead Street. Sometime on the night of 11 April 2014 she heard the sound of a cupboard that she had left in the entranceway of the unit block being moved. She went out of her unit to see what was happening and saw a naked man with blood all over his face. His face was swollen. She asked the man who he was and he said, “Jamie, Jamie.” He was slurring his words as he spoke, and continued to mumble.
	
	
	After she returned to her unit, Ms Gumley heard someone knocking on her door. Her partner called out to see who was at the door. A man answered “Jamie, you know me.” When Ms Gumley’s partner, Robert Papps, told the man to go away, the man said, “No you know me, Jamie, Jamie, I need help” ([11]). The man was asking for help, mentioned the police, and said he wanted to get inside to be protected from the police.
	
	
	Mr Papps opened the door of the unit a crack to throw the man a shirt to put on and the man pushed the door open and entered the unit. Ms Gumley heard him say something but she could not understand him. She saw he had blood all over him. Frightened, she and Mr Papps ran from their unit. Police arrived soon after.
	
	
	Robert Papps (statement, Ex B21) also heard a sound in the building entrance that night and went out with Ms Gumley to look. He saw a naked man wearing only shoes and socks coming up the stairs. He was mumbling. The man said his name and that they shouldn’t panic as he just wanted to come and say hello. Mr Papps said that the man spoke calmly and after following them to their door, did not try to force himself into their unit.
	
	
	When Mr Papps opened the door to give the man a shirt, he entered the flat. Mr Papps and Ms Gumley ran out.
	


Police and Ambulance Officers


	
	Senior Constable Greg Downing (statement, Ex B30; evidence 7 June 2016) was at Redfern Police Station at about 10.15pm when he was advised of an urgent call to attend Morehead Street. He went with Constable Lockyer to 36 Morehead Street where he saw a person lying on the ground in front of the building. He was told that a naked man had assaulted a woman with a rock and the man was in the apartment block at 36 Morehead Street. He and a number of other officers went in search of the male.
	
	
	On entering a unit on the top floor of the building, he called out, “Police, police, come out now” ([4]). The accused walked out of a bathroom and stood in the hall. The accused was naked but for a pair of socks. He had what looked like recent injuries to his face, and his face was swollen. There was blood on his face and smeared onto his upper torso.
	
	
	Although the officer yelled to the accused to get on his knees he remained standing in the hall. The accused said something, but S/C Downing could not understand him. There was a lot of shouting from police. When the accused moved towards the police officers, S/C Downing sprayed a burst of oleoresin capsicum spray (“OC spray”) towards his face. It appeared to have no effect, so the officer directed a second burst of OC spray to the accused’s face, as did another officer, S/C Lay. After a few seconds the accused knelt down and was handcuffed.
	
	
	The officers began to remove the accused from the unit, and he became combative. He was demanding water. He was forcibly removed from the building and dropped to the ground. He was arrested and cautioned.
	
	
	S/C Downing later went into unit 3 of 6 Redfern Street and observed a quantity of blood in a bedroom there, together with signs of disarray in that room.
	
	
	Constable Zan Lockyer (statement, Ex B31; evidence 7 June 2016) was with S/C Downing when the accused emerged from the bathroom. He noticed that the accused’s face was injured and swollen to the point where his eyes were almost swollen shut. He was covered in blood. He said something but it was unintelligible to Con. Lockyer. When he moved towards the police officers OC spray was deployed, with no effect until a second burst was directed to his face.
	
	
	Con. Locker was able to handcuff the accused with his hands to the rear. The accused said, “I need a drink of water” ([10]). There were four officers present and it took all of them to remove the accused from the building and get him outside.
	
	
	Con. Lockyer then gave his attention to Mrs Townsend, who he saw had massive facial injuries. He and another officer, Con. Matthews, tried to administer CPR to her but found it impossible to do more than compressions because of the catastrophic facial injuries. Later, when ambulance personnel had taken over the care of Mrs Townsend, Con. Lockyer noticed a bloody rock or half brick, about a metre and a half from Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	Senior Constable Cory Lay was on patrol in Redfern with Constable Rullis when he heard a message broadcast at about 10.10pm on 11 April 2014 and went immediately to Morehead Street. He went with other officers into a Morehead Street unit block where he saw the accused in a unit. He was naked, and had severe bruising and swelling to his eyes.
	
	
	The accused was directed to get down but stood looking at the police officers. He was steady on his feet. He then moved forward in small shuffling steps. When the accused did not do as directed after sprayed with OC spray by S/C Downing, S/C Lay also directed a burst of spray to the accused’s face, which was almost simultaneous with the second burst directed at him by S/C Downing. The accused was arrested and taken outside.
	
	
	Constable Paul Rullis (statement, Ex B33; evidence 7 June 2016) was with S/C Lay. He also observed that the accused had facial injuries. After the accused was arrested and taken outside he was placed onto the ground. Con. Rullis placed him into the first aid recovery position. The accused said, “Let me sit up. I want water” ([17]). The officer had a conversation with the accused, the details of which do not form part of the evidence, and thought that the accused was clear and coherent in that conversation.
	
	
	Daniel Elson (statement, Ex B34; evidence 7 June 2016) attended the scene that night as a paramedic. He checked Mrs Townsend and concluded that she was not breathing. He noticed a male in police custody who was screaming for moments. He did not take much further notice of the male because he was trying to assist Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	Patrick O’Malley (statement, Ex B35; evidence 7 June 2016) was another of the paramedics to attend the scene. His focus was also on Mrs Townsend, and he made few observations of the accused other than that he was “shouting and carrying on” as the police restrained him, as somebody might do when upset.
	
	
	Ioannis Georgiadis (statement, Ex B36) was part of a second ambulance crew to attend the scene. With paramedics already doing what they could for Mrs Townsend, Mr Georgiadis was directed to the accused. The accused had blood around his nose and mouth so the officer used water and shampoo to wash the blood from his face. The accused allowed this, although he was verbally aggressive, telling the officer to “fucking hurry up” ([10]). When Mr Georgiadis told the accused that he wanted to check his mouth for bleeding, the accused refused, telling him not to touch him. He would not allow observations such as blood pressure and pulse rate to be taken, saying, “I don’t want you to do any of that, just leave me alone” ([11]).
	
	
	After the accused was arrested he was taken to hospital. A blood sample was obtained from him by a doctor, and a buccal swab by a police officer.
	
	
	He was kept in hospital under guard for a short time. The following morning, at about 7.15 on 12 April 2014, one of the officers performing guard duty heard the accused say, “Can I ask you officers a question? Which one of those silly cunts left me alive? They should have killed me. Someone chucked that G in my drink yesterday. I’ve never touched it in my life. I don’t know what I’ve done. Someone’s busted me up pretty bad. Don’t worry I’ll be back. I don’t know what I’ve done” (Ex B42, [9]). The comments were not a sequential narrative, and they were without apparent logic (T52).
	
	
	There is a considerable amount of evidence from investigating and crime scene police, but I do not propose to summarise it here. It is sufficient to note that there was evidence adduced which established, to a degree, the accused’s movements on 11 April 2014, including closed circuit surveillance footage from the Redfern area which showed the movements of some of the individuals involved in these events.
	
	
	After the accused was arrested, he exercised his right to silence.
	


Expert Evidence


	
	In evidence as Ex B54 is a report from forensic pathologist Dr Johan Duflou as to the cause of Mrs Townsend’s death, and the nature of her injuries.
	
	
	Dr Duflou conducted an autopsy on Mrs Townsend’s body on 14 April 2014. He observed extensive blunt force trauma to the face and head, and many fractures to the skull, facial bones, and ribs. The injuries were consistent with infliction through multiple blows with an object such as a small house brick, and were the cause of death.
	
	
	The accused was examined in hospital at about 2am on 12 April 2014 by Dr Claire Nicholls (Ex B53). There was significant swelling around both eyes. A CT scan was conducted which showed multiple and complex facial fractures. A blood sample was obtained at some time after 2.55am on 12 April 2014.
	
	
	The sample of the accused’s blood was later examined (Ex B51 and 52) and found to contain cannabinoids and amphetamines. Delta-9-THC acid in a quantity of 0.015 milligrams per litre was present, as was amphetamine (0.02 mg/L) and methylamphetamine (0.11 mg/L). The drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate, commonly known as GHB, was not detected.
	
	
	John Farrar is a consultant forensic pharmacologist who was asked to review relevant material and give an opinion as to the level of intoxicating drugs affecting the accused on the night of 11 April 2014, and how any such drugs may have impacted upon him.
	
	
	Mr Farrar concluded that the accused’s expected blood methylamphetamine concentration at 10.10pm would have been within the range of 0.13 milligrams per litre and 0.19 milligrams per litre. He would have been significantly or even substantially impaired with such a blood level, and his capacity to form an intention would have been, in Mr Farrar’s opinion, compromised.
	
	
	Mr Farrar did not see cannabis intoxication as having any role to play in the accused’s presentation.
	
	
	Expert opinion evidence was called by the Crown from Dr Margaret Stark, a physician with expertise in the area of chemical forensic medicine (Ex B48; evidence 8 June 2016). Dr Stark was formerly the Director of the NSW Police Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit and Adjunct Professor at the Medical School at the University of Sydney.
	
	
	Having reviewed the clinical evidence relating to the accused, Dr Stark concluded that, on admission to hospital, he had a mild closed head injury following acute blunt force trauma, with serious multiple facial fractures. Symptoms of concussion can be seen after a mild closed head injury. Those symptoms include post-traumatic amnesia, confusion and disorientation. Dr Stark could not give any opinion as to whether the accused was affected by concussion prior to his arrest.
	
	
	She opined that his behaviour as reported by witnesses may have been the result of an acute behavioural disturbance due to methylamphetamine intoxication. Acute methylamphetamine intoxication can cause anxiety, aggression with violent tendencies, memory loss, paranoia, hallucinations, delusions such as a belief that spiders are crawling on the body, or homicidal or suicidal thoughts. Sometimes people so affected will be underclothed because of hyperthermia, and behaviour may be bizarre. An affected individual can be affected psychologically and can behave in a violent way, but not be psychotic.
	
	
	“Excited delirium” can result from methylamphetamine intoxication. The following evidence was given, at T105:
	


“Q. In terms of the word “delirium”, is this a consensus that you make of an ability of the mind to reason and to be rational?

A. Yes. If somebody is seriously unwell, then, yes, that is the whole difference really. I am saying if someone - an analogy, if somebody is mildly intoxicated with alcohol, it may be possible to say to them, calm down, go home, leave the area. But once people are intoxicated with drugs or alcohol to that extent that they are not really taking in what you are saying, you cannot reason with them and you have a real problem. That if they continue to behave in an aggressive manner, for example, people become exhausted, for example and you have somehow to stop the behaviour in order to care for them. So that is why it is such a difficult situation.”


	
	The Delta-9-THC in the accused’s blood sample indicated in Dr Stark’s view that he had taken cannabis in the recent past, and the active metabolite of cannabis could have been present at around 10.10pm on 11 April 2014.
	
	
	Various samples obtained during the course of the police investigation were later subjected to forensic examination by a forensic biologist (Ex B55). Of most relevance to note is the following:
	



	
	A swab of a blood stain on the accused’s chest revealed DNA consistent with that of the accused (the major component) and that of the deceased (the minor component).
	
	
	A swab of a blood stain on the accused’s right ankle revealed a mix of DNA with one contributor consistent with the deceased (the major component). The accused could not be excluded as a contributor to the mix.
	
	
	A swab of a blood stain from the brick found near Mrs Townsend’s body revealed DNA consistent with that of the deceased.
	
	
	A swab of a blood stain from the main bedroom of Margaret Williams’ flat revealed DNA consistent with that of the accused.
	


The Accused’s Case


	
	The accused called evidence from Professor MacDonald Christie (Exs 1 & 3; evidence of 10 June 2016).
	
	
	Professor Christie is Professor of Pharmacology and Associate Dean of Research of the Medical School at the University of Sydney. Like Dr Stark and Mr Farrar, Professor Christie reviewed material relating to the alleged offence and provided an opinion as to the likely drug consumption by the accused prior to the relevant events, and the accused’s state of intoxication.
	
	
	Professor Christie estimated that the accused’s blood methylamphetamine level at the time of the alleged offence was in the range 0.15 – 0.17 mg/L. He said that it was not possible to determine a blood concentration of the active drug THC at that time on the basis of the blood concentration in the accused’s blood sample of the inactive metabolite THC-acid, or to determine any level of impairment.
	
	
	He opined that it was likely, on the basis of the history he had been given from the accused and other relevant information, including the blood analysis, that the accused was very significantly intoxicated at the time of the alleged offence. Typical signs of intoxication include agitation, aggression, erratic or violent behaviour, and decreased fatigue. A psychotic reaction could be caused by intoxication. Although it was beyond his stated expertise to give any definitive conclusion, Professor Christie thought the accused’s reported behaviour could have been attributable to a methylamphetamine induced psychosis.
	
	
	He concluded:
	


“This blood level is associated with increased likelihood of aggressive and violent behaviour, and disinhibition. This does not of itself suggest that he did not form specific intent but may have impaired his reasoning. [..] It is possible that your client suffered a methylamphetamine psychosis during 11 April that may have been present at the time of the offence. If so, it is possible his capacity to form specific [intent] was greatly impaired.” (Ex 3 at [4.3])

The Legal Principles


	
	At the commencement of the trial the accused entered a plea of not guilty and I bear in mind the important presumption that he is innocent until proven guilty.
	
	
	The burden of proof in the trial falls on the Crown and does not shift to the accused.
	
	
	He enjoys a right to silence and was not obliged to speak to the police, or to give evidence in this trial. No adverse inference may be drawn from the fact that he did neither of those things. It is the task of the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	To do so, the Crown must prove each of the elements of the offence of murder, relevantly, that on 11 April 2014 at Redfern:
	



	
	The accused did a deliberate and unlawful act that caused the death of Judith Townsend; and
	
	
	At the time he did that act he intended to kill her or cause her grievous bodily harm; or he was recklessly indifferent to human life.
	



	
	As Mr Todd submits, the focus of the trial has been on the question of whether the Crown has proven that the accused formed the intention to kill or very seriously injure Mrs Townsend, and I do not regard it as necessary to further consider reckless indifference to human life.
	
	
	A person’s intention can be inferred or concluded from the circumstances in which the death occurred and from the conduct of the accused person before, at the time of, or after the commission of the specific act which caused the death of the deceased.
	
	
	In considering whether the Crown has proved that the accused had the intention to kill Mrs Townsend or to cause her grievous bodily harm, it is necessary to consider the effect upon the accused of drugs which the evidence suggests he had consumed, that evidence being derived from analysis of the blood sample taken from the accused at about 2:55am on 12 April 2014 or after, and the observations of him of witnesses.
	
	
	Intoxication by drugs is a relevant matter to be taken into account in determining whether the accused formed the intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm (s 428C(1) Crimes Act). It is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to which I have referred, despite consuming drugs prior to the events the subject of the allegation. It is not for the accused to prove that he did not have the relevant intent.
	
	
	The issue of intoxication is not relevant to the voluntariness of the accused’s alleged act: s 428G(1) Crimes Act.
	
	
	Particularly directed to the issue of intoxication and intention the Court has heard from a number of expert witnesses. There is also expert evidence that goes to other issues, such as the presence and likely identity of DNA.
	
	
	Where the expert evidence was not disputed, such as the evidence of Ms Friedmann as to DNA analysis, there would have to be a very good reason for the Court to reject that evidence.
	
	
	There is some relatively minor disagreement between the evidence of Dr Stark, Mr Farrar and Professor Christie, but that is largely confined to the role, if any, of cannabis intoxication and the possible interaction between cannabis and methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The value of any expert opinion is very much dependent on the reliability and accuracy of the material which the expert used to reach his or her opinion, and upon the skill and experience brought to bear in formulating the opinion given. It will be useful to assess the expert evidence in the context of the whole of the evidence. In considering the evidence of experts, it is not a case of simply choosing between their evidence as a matter of preference.
	
	
	It may be necessary to draw inferences when considering the evidence. If so, it is necessary to do so with great care, and only after concluding that the inference drawn is a rational and justifiable inference.
	


Consideration of the Evidence

The Circumstances of, and Surrounding, the Death of Mrs Townsend


	
	Much of the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs Townsend has not been the subject of challenge and, having considered the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did a deliberate act for which there was no lawful excuse, and that act caused the death of Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	The accused’s movements on the afternoon of 11 April 2014 are, to some degree, established by Ex R. He was in the general area of Redfern and Surry Hills, and was recorded as being on Cleveland Street at around 1pm, in the area of the Tudor Hall Hotel between about 1pm and 2pm, and at the Surry Hills Mall and surrounds thereafter. He was in the same general area later in the afternoon when he was recorded at the Mall and the TAB counter of the Tudor Hall Hotel, and at the Grosvenor Hotel in Phillip Street Waterloo at 6.12pm, and again at 6.48pm. There is nothing in the accused’s movements as recorded in Ex R to suggest that he was impaired during the afternoon and early evening.
	
	
	Thereafter, the accused was in the area of Redfern and Morehead Streets in Redfern.
	
	
	Professor Christie recounts a history supplied to him derived from the accused that refers to the accused obtaining and using illicit drugs during the afternoon, but there is no independent evidence of that, other than what can be inferred from the toxicology evidence.
	
	
	There is evidence from witnesses who encountered the accused during the course of the evening, and observed his behaviour, that would support a conclusion that he did consume methylamphetamine during the afternoon, and also cannabis.
	
	
	At about 1 or 1.30pm, the accused was at the deceased’s home and, although he did not enter the unit, Ralph Townsend’s evidence is such that there is no real reason to conclude that the accused was adversely affected by drug use at that time. He wanted to enter his aunt’s unit but was accepting of her refusal to give him entry, as she was going out.
	
	
	By later in the evening, the accused was reporting to Margaret Williams that he did not feel well, having taken some “pot,” a reference to cannabis. Ms Williams was sufficiently discomfited by the accused’s odd behaviour as to decide to leave her unit and go downstairs to her neighbours, the Townsends.
	
	
	Although Mr Townsend stated that Ms Williams made a reference to “Brothers for Life” being at her unit, I cannot conclude anything from that in the absence of any evidence on the point from Ms Williams, or any other occupant of her flat.
	
	
	It may be, as Mr Todd submits, that members of this organisation had some role to play in inflicting the severe facial injuries sustained by the accused, but the evidence of that is absent. It can be no more than a hearsay account from Mr Townsend of doubtful reliability.
	
	
	The other occupants of the Williams unit also reported odd, even bizarre behaviour from the accused. Although Joshua Skartados thought that the accused was his usual calm self when he arrived at the unit, probably around 8pm by reference to Ex R, and unaffected by alcohol or drugs, he soon began to behave in a manner Mr Skartados described as weird. The accused complained of feeling funny after having had a cone, again a reference to cannabis, and was walking in circles.
	
	
	Jazmena Williams heard the accused make the same complaint. At some time after both Margaret Williams and her son had left the unit, the witness saw the accused with a knife saying, “I just gotta do it”. What it is he was referring to, is not established by the evidence.
	
	
	At that stage the accused’s behaviour had become markedly aggressive. He took Beatrice Haines by the hair and forced her at knifepoint into a bedroom. Although Ms Haines refused to make a statement to police, and it is not possible on the evidence to know what happened to her, she was clearly assaulted by the accused, even if that assault was confined to that which was observed by Jazmena Williams. I have had regard to the evidence of that assault only insofar as it is relevant to consideration of the accused’s state of mind, and not as relevant to his character.
	
	
	The evidence of Kantarli O’Reilly confirms that of Jazmena Williams, both as to the accused’s aggressive behaviour and his apparently drug affected state.
	
	
	It is apparent from the evidence of each of those witnesses that, at the point at which each lost sight of the accused, he was not injured, and he was dressed in a shirt and shorts.
	
	
	By the time Ralph Townsend heard the accused kicking his front door, and looked through the security peephole to see him (probably between 9 and 9.30pm), the accused was naked. He does not appear to have been injured by that stage.
	
	
	The descent into aggression by the accused seems to have been relatively rapid, from sometime after his arrival at the top floor unit of 6 Redfern Street around 8pm, and by the time the Townsends left the block, at 21.39 that evening, and to have occurred independent of the injuries that were inflicted upon him.
	
	
	This could be consistent with methylamphetamine intoxication, or even drug induced psychosis, as could the other behaviour witnesses have described as odd, possessed, or weird.
	
	
	Although the evidence does not allow me to conclude when or how or by whom, it is likely that the accused was violently assaulted in the Williams unit at 6 Redfern Street between the time his aunt left the unit block with her husband to go for a walk, and the time he left it himself, probably at 10.06pm. Ex R records a man, almost certainly the accused, leaving the unit block at that time, and walking out into the street.
	
	
	The accused was under the observation of witnesses from that time until he was observed at close quarters by Lolli Daniels, and noted by her to be injured, and he was not the victim of an assault after 10.06pm. Necessarily, he must have been injured before leaving 6 Redfern Street at 10.06. The blood in the bedroom of the Williams unit, and its state of disarray, suggests that the accused was assaulted in that location. He was certainly injured; he may have been concussed, although the latter is no more than speculative on the evidence.
	
	
	Dimitri Kouznetsov saw the accused as he emerged from the unit block at 10.06pm. His attention was drawn to him by his nakedness. He did not observe the accused to be injured, but that must have been as a consequence of lighting, or the view he had.
	
	
	Mr. Kouznetsov saw someone he described as a girl walking in Morehead Street. This must have been Mrs Townsend. It may be, having regard to the evidence of Lydia Clarke, that Mrs Townsend had entered her unit block to return to her flat, but left it again, perhaps on seeing the accused come down the stairs.
	
	
	On Ms Clarke’s evidence, a woman who must have been Mrs Townsend emerged from the entrance to the unit block, with the accused following almost immediately behind her. Although Ms Clarke saw the deceased glance behind her, by which she must have seen the accused, she did not stop.
	
	
	The accused followed her. In a movement I regard as of significance, Ms Clarke saw the accused bend down to the ground and pick something up in his right hand. She thought it was a stick, rock or brick, and observed that there was a tap with crumbling brickwork nearby.
	
	
	I accept her evidence on this point and conclude that, having seen his aunt and moved to walk quickly after her, the accused purposively took up an object from the ground, which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was the brick later found near the body of Mrs Townsend, stained with her blood.
	
	
	I accept also that Mrs Townsend looked behind her, and would thereby have seen the accused. Certainly, on the evidence of Mr Kouznetsov, she expressed no surprise when he approached her from behind, despite the accused’s nakedness, and having caught up to her and draped an arm around her shoulders. Nor did she appear to struggle against him when, on the evidence of Annie Maguire, he put his arms around her body.
	
	
	It must have been seconds or minutes after Mr Kouznetsov saw the pair walk around the corner, that Lolli Daniels came upon the accused in the front of 36 Morehead Street, and heard him say, “You’re not my fucking aunty, you’re not my aunty.” Rather than the hug Ms Maguire had seen the accused holding his aunt in, the accused had by this stage taken hold of her by her throat and shoulder and he began to strike her in the face. The blows had sufficient force to push Mrs Townsend’s head back into a window of the ground floor of the building with each blow, and to cause her to moan.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence of Ms Daniels, that the woman’s face was covered in blood after six to ten blows had been landed as she was held upright, and to that of Michael Binge, who saw the woman drop to the ground when released without moving to break her fall, I conclude that the accused used the brick with which he had earlier armed himself when he hit Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	The accused’s focus on what he was doing was referred to by Ms Daniels as being “zoned in.” Her acts in swinging her handbag and shouting at him did not cause him to desist. She and Mr Binge moved off.
	
	
	It appears that the accused moved away from the prone body of Mrs Townsend for a few moments, perhaps to walk after Ms Daniels and Mr Binge briefly. On the evidence of Ms Harmer and Mr Kinross, he returned to where Mrs Townsend lay and, getting down on first one knee and then both, he began to strike down at Mrs Townsend with the brick still in his hands. Multiple blows were landed upon her face and head. Ms Harmer saw the accused bringing the brick down on the body, “aiming at the head” ([13]).
	
	
	There can be no doubt on all of the relevant evidence that the accused was the person who attacked Mrs Townsend, and that he did so using a brick to strike her to the head and face multiple times. The injuries he caused were catastrophic, and were the direct cause of death.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence of Ms Daniels, Ms Harmer and Mr Kinross in particular, there can be no doubt that his act in so doing was deliberate and unlawful.
	


The Question of Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt of Mens Rea


	
	The Crown must additionally prove that, when the accused did the deliberate and unlawful act that caused death, he intended to either kill Mrs Townsend or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her.
	
	
	To assess whether the existence of such intent has been proved, it is necessary to consider the expert evidence relevant to intoxication, and the evidence of those who saw the accused at about the time the act was done.
	
	
	There is evidence that suggests that the accused had intended to have a big night out on 10 April 2014, and he may have sought out and used illicit drugs in that context (Ex M). There is also evidence upon which to conclude that drug use would have had an acute impact upon him. The accused had not consumed methylamphetamine or cannabis in the previous three months and would not have had the tolerance to be expected of a recent regular user of those drugs. The intoxicating effects of the drugs would likely have been more significant upon him than upon an individual who was using them regularly.
	
	
	The evidence of analysis of the blood sample taken from the accused at around 3am on 12 April 2014 establishes that he had used methylamphetamine and cannabis in the recent past, because of the presence of prohibited drugs, and / or their metabolites, in the sample.
	
	
	Both Mr Farrar and Professor Christie have considered that evidence to undertake a “back calculation” of the likely level of methylamphetamine in the accused’s blood at about the time Mrs Townsend was assaulted, around 10.10pm on 11 April 2014. The range calculated by each is broadly consistent, and establishes that the accused had a very high blood methylamphetamine level at the material time within the ranges of 0.13 milligrams per litre and 0.19 milligrams per litre (Mr Farrar) and 0.15 milligrams per litre and 0.17 milligrams per litre (Professor Christie). A level within that range would have had a significant impact on the accused, leaving him functionally impaired.
	
	
	The presence of a cannabis metabolite in the accused’s blood sample indicates, in the unanimous evidence of Dr Stark, Mr Farrar and Professor Christie, that the accused had used cannabis in the recent past. This is consistent with the accounts of witnesses who heard the accused say he had consumed “pot” or “a cone” when he spoke to them after about 8pm on the night of 11 April 2014.
	
	
	I am satisfied that he had used both methylamphetamine and cannabis at some stage on 11 April 2014, prior to attending the Williams unit, the former probably in a significant quantity.
	
	
	There is a dispute in the expert evidence as to the role of cannabis intoxication but I do not think it is of any particular significance. Having regard to the expert evidence, and to the evidence of witnesses who described the accused’s strange behaviour, I have concluded that the accused was in fact significantly intoxicated, either by methylamphetamine use, or a combination of methylamphetamine and cannabis.
	
	
	I cannot conclude, even on the balance of probabilities, that the accused had consumed GHB, intentionally or by unwittingly drinking something that contained the drug. The only evidence about GHB comes from what the accused was heard to say when under guard in hospital on 12 April 2014. His comments there are rambling in nature, and not of a character as to be reliable. I note also that he had been administered pain relief in hospital.
	
	
	Even accepting that the accused had himself concluded that he had been given GHB by some person on 11 April 2014, the basis of that conclusion is nothing more than speculation.
	
	
	Accepting that the accused was intoxicated to a very significant degree at 10.10pm on 11 April 2014, the question to be resolved is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that he had an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm when he attacked Mrs Townsend.
	
	
	The utility of the expert evidence when determining that issue is limited.
	
	
	Firstly, there is no objective and reliable evidence of the history of the accused’s drug use at the relevant time, and so the evidence of the blood analysis falls to be considered in a vacuum. Whilst Professor Christie had the additional information, not initially available to Dr Stark or Mr Farrar, of an account of his drug use given by the accused to his legal representatives, I cannot conclude that a hearsay account can be accepted as reliable. The account was not subject to any form of testing to ascertain its reliability; it is the account of an individual whose memory of relevant events appears to be impaired; and it is the account of an individual who was drug affected for at least part of the time over which the drugs were taken. Where Professor Christie’s opinion relies upon an acceptance of the history related to him, I have set it aside.
	
	
	Secondly, as all the experts agreed, the impact of methylamphetamine and / or cannabis intoxication on an individual is highly variable. Dr Stark deposed that:
	


“[..] the effect that drugs have on an individual can be very variable depending on lots of things. So not just the drug level but their mood and other conditions that they may have at a particular time. So it is not always possible to be completely precise about the effects of the level of a drug on an individual.” (T99:9 -13)


	
	For that reason, general accounts of methylamphetamine or cannabis intoxication and its manifestation are not conclusive of the specific effect on the accused of the drugs he had taken.
	
	
	Finally, it was not within the expertise of any of the experts called in evidence to tell me whether the accused could have formed the necessary intent having regard to the evidence of drug use. Whilst both Mr Farrar and Professor Christie expressed opinions as to the accused’s capacity to form an intention, and whether he may have been affected by a drug induced psychosis, neither had the expertise to provide such opinions, and I have set their evidence aside in that regard.
	
	
	I accept that the accused exhibited behaviour consistent with significant methylamphetamine intoxication, and potentially consistent with a drug induced psychosis, but the evidence as to the latter is suggestive only, and I cannot find, even on the balance of probabilities, that he was in fact psychotic. I am conscious of Dr Stark’s evidence that an individual can have an acute behavioural disturbance from methylamphetamine intoxication without at the same time being psychotic (T101:26).
	
	
	I accept, having regard to the evidence of blood analysis and to that of Dr Stark, Mr Farrar and Professor Christie, that the accused had consumed methylamphetamine and cannabis at some stage before attending 6 Redfern Street on the night of 11 April 2014, and that he was significantly impaired by his use of those drugs. It is most likely that the odd behaviour that he began to demonstrate soon after arriving in the Williams unit, and the aggression seen by Jazmena Williams and Ms O’Reilly are attributable, at least in part, to methylamphetamine intoxication.
	
	
	With the expert evidence informing the accounts of those who saw the accused around the time of the assault upon Mrs Townsend, I have preferred to rely upon those witness accounts in determining whether the Crown has proved the mental element to the requisite standard.
	
	
	On that evidence, I have concluded that, although some aspects of the accused’s conduct that night, such as his lack of coordination when eating grapes, are indicative of intoxication, and intoxication likely had a disinhibiting effect upon the accused, his actions towards his aunt were purposeful as well as deliberate.
	
	
	When the accused left the unit block at 6 Redfern Street, he saw his aunt and followed her, walking at a fast pace to catch her. Lydia Clarke saw him bend down and pick up an object, which I have concluded was the brick piece he later used to strike Mrs Townsend. The act of bending to pick up an object capable of use as a weapon is a purposive act that bespeaks a plan of action. There were certain to be other objects lying on the ground that night: leaves from the plane trees that lined the street, discarded cigarette butts or other detritus, a feather, a pebble. The accused stooped down and picked up a grapefruit sized brick. That suggests purpose and reasoned choice.
	
	
	Although the cause of it is not established on the evidence, the accused had by that stage become angry with his aunt, with that anger expressed in the words Lolli Daniels heard, “You’re not my fucking aunty, you’re not my aunty.” Whilst I accept Mr Todd’s submission that there is no evidence to suggest antipathy from the accused to his aunt earlier in the evening, and there is no evidence capable of establishing a motive for the accused to wish his aunt harm, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove earlier hostility, or motive.
	
	
	He had become hostile to her, for a reason I cannot determine, by a little after 10pm.
	
	
	The accused’s act in striking Mrs Townsend to the face multiple times with the brick was also purposeful. His focus on that act was such that he was not moved to desist by Ms Daniels shouting and swinging her handbag at him. Such focus also bespeaks purpose and intent.
	
	
	That is further supported by the evidence of Stacey Harmer, who saw the accused kneeling over and striking multiple blows into what she thought was the ground, in fact Mrs Townsend’s face, and who saw the accused “aiming” at Mrs Townsend’s head. Mr Kinross similarly saw the accused raise something over his head and strike down.
	
	
	These were forceful blows, struck not in a random or directionless way, but to the most vulnerable part of the body, with aim, and using a half brick which the accused had specifically bent to pick up.
	
	
	When he no longer needed the brick to affect his purpose, the accused abandoned it. This too suggests that the accused had selected the brick piece for a specific purpose, and discarded it when that purpose was affected.
	
	
	After walking away from Mrs Townsend, the accused went into 38 Morehead Street. Kim Gumley and Robert Papps saw him there. Although aspects of the accused’s behaviour again confirm his intoxication, such as the slurred way Ms Gumley heard him speak, other behaviour was consistent with reason and purpose. The accused identified himself to Mr Papps, said that he and Ms Gumley shouldn’t panic, and mentioned wanting to get inside Ms Gumley’s unit to be protected from the police. For an individual who had just committed a serious assault to seek shelter from police is not an unreasonable or irrational response.
	
	
	Similarly, the accused’s refusal to comply with the demands of arresting police that he get to his knees suggests a wish not to be arrested. His resistance to the effects of OC spray is consistent with methylamphetamine intoxication but does not detract from my conclusion that the accused was capable of and did act in a purposeful way. Although his speech was difficult to understand at times, he could make rational requests, such as his request of Con. Lockyer for a drink of water, or of Con. Rullis to be allowed to sit up and be given water. Con. Rullis thought the accused’s speech at that point was clear and coherent.
	
	
	Whilst the accused was aggressive in speech to ambulance officer Georgiadis, he displayed a capacity to make choices. He allowed his facial injuries to be cleaned, but refused to allow general observations to be made: “I don’t want you to do any of that, just leave me alone.”
	
	
	The close temporal proximity of these events to the assault upon Mrs Townsend makes the accused’s behaviour immediately following the assault relevant to proof of whether he formed the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Although I do not doubt that the accused would not have acted as he did but for his state of intoxication, I am satisfied that his intoxication was not such as to preclude him from forming an intention to kill his aunt or to do her grievous bodily harm. I am satisfied on the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had formed a specific intent to, at least, inflict grievous bodily harm, or kill his aunt.
	


Verdict


	
	On the charge that, on 11 April 2014 at Redfern in the State of New South Wales, Jamie May murdered Judith Townsend, I find him guilty.

		21 June 2016",2016-06-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701445,R v Hart [2016] NSWSC 955,"Ex Tempore JUDGMENT (revised)


	
	The applicant is standing trial on an indictment alleging that he murdered Luke Hargrave at Albury on 30 October 2013. The events occurred the previous day, on 29 October 2013. It is alleged that late that evening Mr Hart, the accused, shot Mr Hargrave, the deceased, with a firearm known as a pen gun. Mr Hargrave died at Albury Base Hospital in the morning of 30th.
	
	
	To this charge Mr Hart has entered a plea of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown do not accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment.
	
	
	A question has arisen about the admissibility of the expert evidence of Dr Anna Farrar, a forensic psychiatrist, which the defence seeks leave to rely upon.
	
	
	The need for leave arises out of a direction which I made on 13 May 2016 that any expert report upon which the accused intended to rely should be served on the prosecution by 6 June 2016. The application for leave is supported by the affidavit of Graham Francis Lamond sworn on 20 June 2016. Mr Lamond is the solicitor for the accused.
	
	
	I am satisfied that, at the time my direction was made, that Mr Lamond, in consultation with Mr Wilson of senior counse,l who appears for the accused, had been diligently engaged in the process of attempting to locate a suitably qualified expert who could give evidence about the effect, if any, of Mr Hart's methylamphetamine habit, and his methylamphetamine intoxication on the day, on his capacity to form the necessary intent to kill or inflict really serious bodily injury upon Mr Hargrave.
	
	
	I accept that in early May, after approaching various experts, Mr Lamond identified Dr Farrar as someone who was both appropriately qualified and who would be able to make herself available to conduct an assessment of the accused and provide an expert report. Unfortunately for the accused, despite displacing other professional work, she was not able to produce her report until 16 June 2016.
	
	
	Without going through all of the detail, I am satisfied that the opinions she expresses are relevant in the sense they could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment by the jury of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings; the fact in issue relevantly being the question of whether the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time Mr Hargrave was shot, Mr Hart actually had the requisite intention for the crime of murder.
	
	
	In coming to that conclusion I have borne in mind that some of Dr Farrar's evidence is given at a fairly abstract level of generality. However, essentially, she expresses the opinion that at the time of the alleged offending Mr Hart suffered from a substance-induced psychotic disorder in accordance with the diagnostic criteria established by the publication utilised by practising psychiatrists and generally referred to as DSM-5.
	
	
	She also expressed the view that, ""The substance-induced psychotic disorder would have likely affected Mr Hart's ability to behave in a rational manner and would have impaired his judgment and decision-making ability. Mr Hart's substance-induced psychotic disorder would also likely impair his ability to form the intent required for a charge of murder at the time of the alleged offence on 29 October 2013.”
	
	
	During the course of argument yesterday I expressed the provisional view that an opinion expressed in those terms may not meet the criteria for admissibility as expert evidence because it did not sufficiently disclose the doctor's reasoning in coming to that conclusion.
	
	
	It has been said that a prime duty of experts in giving opinion evidence is to furnish the trier of fact with criteria enabling a valuation of the validity of the expert's conclusions; see Makita v Sprowles (2001) NSWCA 305; 52 NSWLR 705 at [59] - [64]. See also Dasreef v Hawchar (2011) HCA 21; 243 CLR 586, 622 [37]; and Honeysett v the Queen [2014] HCA 29; 253 CLR 122, [29] - [31].
	
	
	I acceded to an application for Dr Farrar to give evidence effectively on a so-called Basha inquiry today, which she did, by way of audio-visual link. She also took the opportunity to produce a second report dated 20 June 2016 overnight which expanded upon, or amplified, her original report in a way which made her reasoning more patent.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Dr Farrar's expertise has been applied by reference to the facts she has assumed, and which she has made relatively clear, to give rise to the opinion which is wholly and substantially based upon her branch of specialised knowledge.
	
	
	I also accept, as the High Court observed in Dasreef at [37], ""That a specialist medical practitioner expressing a diagnostic opinion in his or her relevant field of specialisation “is applying specialised knowledge” based on his or her “training, study or experience” being an opinion “wholly or substantially based” on that specialised knowledge “and will require little explicit articulation or amplification once the witness has described his or her qualifications and experience and has identified the subject matter about which the opinion is proffered.”
	
	
	Mr Creasey of senior counsel, who appears as Crown Prosecutor, initially objected on two bases. The first basis related to relevance and whether the basis of the opinion was sufficiently disclosed to measure up to the requirements of section 79. The second basis was that the Crown had been caught by surprise by the late service of the report and would not be in a position to meet the evidence proposed to be adduced from Dr Farrar. However, I am informed that the opportunity presented by the adjournment overnight has enabled the Crown to identify a suitably qualified expert who can at least review Dr Farrar's opinions as expressed in her reports and the transcript of evidence taken this morning.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor agreed that, given that Dr Farrar has said - and this is not challenged - that upon her examination on 31 May 2016 a mental state examination was entirely unremarkable and Mr Hart appears to be in complete remission from the disease, there was little point in attempting to have a psychiatrist on behalf of the Crown conduct an examination. However, given that the requirements of modern case management, even in criminal cases, entitle a party to assume that the opposing side will comply with directions and to prepare its case accordingly, I accept that there is a degree of prejudice constituted by the Crown having to meet this aspect, indeed, a new aspect, of the defence case on the run. For that reason I have indicated that I would permit the Crown to call any expert evidence it wished to call in contradiction or reply to the evidence of Dr Farrar in a case in reply and I will make a direction in that regard at the conclusion of these reasons.
	
	
	I should point out that Mr Wilson SC disavows any reliance upon the provisions of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) notwithstanding that Dr Farrar has expressed herself in a way which might lend itself to the engagement of that provision. Learned senior counsel says that the difficulties in that regard would be insurmountable given that the whole condition arises out of ongoing self-induced intoxication with an illegal drug.
	
	
	Moreover, I also observe that I am informed that it is the Crown case that Mr Hart's conduct immediately after the incident in which Mr Hargrave was shot and the differing accounts given to police officers after his arrest amount to conduct and lies which constitute evidence of a consciousness of guilt on his part. I note that there are sometimes difficulties in making good such a case where the principal charge is murder and an alternative of manslaughter is available. However, Mr Wilson argues that the evidence of Dr Farrar is relevant also to those issues in that, if her evidence is accepted by the jury, it may explain his flight, his torching of the car and the differing accounts because of his, I will say, addled mental processes and his paranoia which are symptoms of his disease. It seems to me that Dr Farrar's opinion is also relevant for that second purpose.
	
	
	I state the obvious, that acceptance or otherwise of Dr Farrar's opinion will be entirely a matter for the jury and, whether or not the Crown contradict her opinions, it will be a matter for the jury to assess whether the reasons she gives for the opinions that she has expressed are compelling to them such that they accept her evidence. I do not use the word ""compelling"" as indicating a standard of proof in any way.
	
	
	Some of what I have said already addresses the requirements of section 192 Evidence Act 1995, however, I will make explicit that admission of Dr Farrar's evidence, and any psychiatric evidence in reply by the Crown, is unlikely to unduly lengthen this trial, which is already set down for three to four weeks. Although the late service of the report has caused some prejudice to the Crown, that prejudice is able to be cured by the admission of evidence in reply if it chooses to exercise the liberty I will reserve in that regard. On the other hand, it would be unfair to the accused not to permit this evidence to be adduced, as it clearly is relevant to his defence and may, in conjunction with other evidence, give him an opportunity to obtain a verdict of not guilty of murder from the jury.
	
	
	What I have just said encapsulates the possible importance of the evidence to be adduced - this is a criminal trial for murder - and it cannot be gainsaid that these are important proceedings for both the Crown and the accused, but that consideration militates, I think, in favour of granting the leave sought.
	
	
	I had offered the Crown a short adjournment to enable it to obtain the benefit of at least a conference with the psychiatrist who may be qualified to give evidence, but in great fairness, Mr Creasey has indicated that he will not be hampered in his conduct of the commencement of the trial provided that Mr Wilson, as he will, opens his case in the way he has indicated to me this morning as recorded in the transcript, and in those circumstances no adjournment is required. For all of these reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	Under ss 192 and 192A Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) I grant leave to the defence to rely upon the opinions of Dr Anna Farrar which I rule are relevant in the way I have explained in my reasons.
	
	
	I grant leave to the Crown, if so advised, to call psychiatric evidence in reply in contradiction or qualification of the opinions expressed by Dr Farrar.

2701460,Hona v R [2016] NSWCCA 119,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 14 February 2014 the applicant, David Hona, was charged with an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the offence having been committed some two months earlier, on 14 December 2013. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 4 years is specified by the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The charge was framed in the following terms:
	


“…on Saturday 14 December 2013 at Campbell Parade Bondi Beach in the State of New South Wales [the applicant] did cause grievous bodily harm to Michael McEwan, and was reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to Michael McEwan.”


	
	On 24 June 2014 he entered a plea of guilty to the charge against him and was committed for sentence to the District Court of New South Wales. On 10 October 2014 a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months was imposed upon him by her Honour Judge Hock. A non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months was fixed.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the sentence imposed upon him. If granted leave the applicant seeks to advance three grounds:
	



	
	“The learned judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in drawing adverse inferences of fact which were not open beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The learned judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in failing to take into account four months the applicant spent in adult custody solely referable to this offence prior to the commencement date of the sentence.
	
	
	The sentence is manifestly excessive”.
	


The Proceedings Before the District Court


	
	The sentence hearing before her Honour proceeded upon the basis of facts tendered by the Crown and agreed to be accurate by the applicant. In imposing sentence upon the applicant, her Honour found the facts of the offence to be as agreed by the parties.
	
	
	The following account is drawn from her Honour’s judgment.
	
	
	In the late hours of Friday 13 December 2013 the applicant, who was then just weeks short of his twentieth birthday, was at a hotel in Bondi Beach accompanied by his cousin, Jamie Ennis. There was an incident at the hotel and the applicant and his cousin were ejected from the premises by security staff. The applicant and two friends went to a take away food shop where the applicant got into an argument with staff and a customer. He left the shop and went out onto the street. It was about 1.40 am on the morning of Saturday 14 December 2013.
	
	
	Mr Ennis got into a verbal altercation with the victim, Michael McEwan, and the argument continued as Mr McEwan walked away in the direction of a bus shelter. At the bus shelter, Mr Ennis ripped Mr McEwan’s t-shirt in two, and Mr McEwan discarded it. A witness intervened and removed Mr Ennis from the area.
	
	
	The applicant squeezed through a fence to enable him to cross Campbell Parade and walked in the direction of the bus shelter, walking around behind it to where Mr McEwan was standing.
	
	
	As Mr McEwan stood with his arms held out and his palms open the applicant struck him to his face, using his right elbow. The force of the blow caused Mr McEwan to fall backwards. As he fell, the applicant swung another blow at Mr McEwan’s head. The victim fell backwards, landing heavily on the footpath.
	
	
	While Mr McEwan lay unconscious on the footpath the applicant stepped towards him and “stomped” one foot forcefully into Mr McEwan’s chest. The applicant then walked off, followed soon after by Mr Ennis.
	
	
	Ambulance personnel attended to the critically injured Mr McEwan. He was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital where he was found to have a severe head injury. He was deeply unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score of 3 (out of 15, with 3 the lowest score available). On examination he was found to have a fracture to the occipital bone at the base of the skull and an extensive and acute subdural haematoma.
	
	
	Immediate emergency surgery was required to relieve the pressure on his brain and save his life, with the removal of a bone flap from the skull necessary. Following surgery Mr McEwan remained in a medically induced coma for over a week. During that time Mr McEwan was returned to surgery for the insertion of a drain into his brain to further reduce the ongoing elevated intracranial pressure. He was in intensive care for some nine days.
	
	
	During recovery, Mr McEwan developed pneumonia, which developed into a staphylococcal infection requiring treatment with antibiotics.
	
	
	The medical opinion of the treating neurosurgeon was that Mr McEwan’s head injury was “severe” and “…without surgery and intensive medical management in the intensive care unit it would have been fatal.”
	
	
	Mr McEwan required rehabilitation for motor function, in addition to physiotherapy, and further surgery in the ensuing months. He had ongoing problems with fatigue, dizziness, and light headedness, and was not able to continue to work full-time as he had previously done. He required daily living assistance and had to move in with his parents for a time for that aid.
	
	
	By July 2014 Mr McEwan had regained his independence but, at the date of sentencing, further surgery was still required to correct the depression in his skull at the craniotomy site. The treating neurosurgeon noted that there would be some level of permanent cognitive decline, and that the victim would be affected by the injury for the rest of his life.
	
	
	The applicant was not arrested until 14 February 2014. He was interviewed by investigating police, making a number of admissions including identifying himself in footage recovered from closed circuit surveillance cameras in operation in the area at the time of the offence. He told police that he had been intoxicated at the time and had limited memory of the night. He recalled scaling a metal barrier to cross Campbell Parade and seeing a man with no shirt, but had no memory of striking him.
	
	
	The applicant said that he had been drinking since about 1pm that day, in anticipation of being sentenced the following Monday (for other offences, including reckless wounding, for which he had been called up).
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case   


	
	Also before the sentencing judge in the Crown case were a series of photographs of the depression and scarring to Mr McEwan’s skull, following surgical repair, together with an expert certificate pursuant to s 177 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which set out greater detail of Mr McEwan’s injuries, and what was required for his recovery.
	
	
	A victim impact statement provided more personal detail of the toll taken upon Mr McEwan by the assault and the injuries occasioned to him. He told the sentencing court of the trauma, both physical and emotional, that the applicant’s crime had caused him, including being left unable to walk until he relearned that skill, loss of independence, inability to continue his employment, extreme fatigue, and reduced cognitive capacities.
	
	
	The Crown tendered the applicant’s criminal antecedents, which recorded a number of entries for offences of violence, together with the facts of those earlier offences.
	
	
	On 11 July 2011 the applicant was dealt with by Bidura Children’s Court for offences of affray, resisting police, and assaulting a police officer in the execution of duty. The offences occurred on 29 April 2011, when the applicant was aged 18 years and 3 months.
	
	
	On that occasion the applicant became involved in an argument between his friend and another youth at a McDonald’s restaurant at Bondi Beach, throwing a number of punches at the youth, and then brawling with other youths who joined the fight. The restaurant was filled with staff and customers at the time. The applicant was arrested outside the restaurant, but was aggressive with the police and refused their directions. Two officers took hold of the applicant, at which point he punched an officer to the left side of her head, knocking her to the ground and causing injury. Other officers sought to restrain the applicant, who was swinging his arms and actively struggling against them. Ultimately, it took a number of police and one or two bursts of capsicum spray to subdue the applicant so that he could be handcuffed.
	
	
	The Children’s Court imposed a fine upon the applicant for the offence of affray. In relation to the other offences, the applicant was placed under the supervision of the Juvenile Justice Office for 6 months pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). The applicant was later called up for breach of the supervision orders, and on 20 June 2012, placed upon two further bonds by the Children’s Court, for a period of 18 months each.
	
	
	On 20 June 2012 the applicant appeared before the Children’s Court in relation to offences of using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (intimidation), contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, and reckless wounding in company, contrary to s 35(3) of the same Act.
	
	
	The offences occurred late at night on Saturday 17 September 2011 at a residence in Darling Point where a party was being held. A group of males attended the party but were not wanted there and were asked to leave. They did leave, but returned soon after. The applicant was among the group of males; he was armed with a knife which he had secreted in the front of his pants.
	
	
	The applicant pulled the knife from his pants, pushed one of the partygoers up against a wall, and held the knife against his throat, demanding, “Do you want me to open you up, do you want me to kill ya?” This threat with a knife constituted the s 33B(1)(a) offence.
	
	
	Some time after the first confrontation was diffused, one of the partygoers went out in the street whereupon he was surrounded by the group of males who all began to hit him. The applicant hit the partygoer to the stomach, leaving him feeling winded. A witness saw the applicant put something into the front of his pants after striking the partygoer. The partygoer heard a member of the group say “Boonga [the applicant] stabbed him, let’s get out of here”. The group of men, including the applicant, ran off.
	
	
	The partygoer found that he had sustained two stab wounds to the stomach which required surgical repair. There was a further wound under an arm.
	
	
	The Children’s Court imposed control orders pursuant to s 33(1)(g) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act upon him; for 3 months in relation to the first offence and 15 months for the second, wholly concurrent. A 6 month non-parole period was specified. On appeal to the District Court the sentences were varied to a term of 100 hours community service for the s 33B(1)(a) offence and a 15 month control order, suspended, for the reckless wounding.
	
	
	On 16 December 2013 the applicant was called up for a breach of the suspended control order, and a control order for 15 months was imposed, with a non-parole period of 6 months, to date from 16 December 2013 and expiring on 15 June 2014. The overall sentence expired on 15 March 2015. It was this sentence that the applicant had been anticipating when he went out drinking on the night of Friday 13 December 2013, intending to make the most of what he expected would be his last hours of liberty.
	
	
	The last set of antecedent offences committed by the applicant were offences that occurred on or about 2 March 2013. At some stage in the late hours of 1 March or the early hours of 2 March 2013 the applicant broke into a Holden Commodore station wagon parked at Bondi Beach and, finding a spare key within the car, began driving it, despite not having a driver’s licence. He drove at such speed and in such a dangerous manner that he caught the attention of police on patrol in the Bondi area who activated warning lights and sirens to signal to the applicant to stop the car. He did not, and a pursuit ensued. The applicant’s flight ended when he lost control of the vehicle and crashed. When he was removed from the car he was found to be under the influence of alcohol, and in possession of a credit card in the name of another individual not known to him. He claimed to have been given the credit card.
	
	
	Charges of take and drive conveyance (s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act), drive manner dangerous (s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW)), drive without a licence (s 25(1)(A) Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (NSW)), drive recklessly in police pursuit (s 51B(1) Crimes Act), goods in custody (s 527C(1)(a) Crimes Act) and drive under the influence of alcohol (s 12(1)(a) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act) all followed. The applicant was on bail for these offences at the time of committing the present offence.
	
	
	The applicant appeared before the Waverley Local Court on 19 December 2013, receiving sentences ranging from a conviction without penalty, pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for the unlicensed driver charge), to a term of imprisonment for 20 months, suspended pursuant to s 12 of the same Act, for the police pursuit offence. The remaining offences were dealt with by s 9 bonds of varying length. Disqualifications from driving were imposed for relevant offences.
	
	
	A Corrective Services history was the final document tendered in the Crown case. It showed that the applicant entered the custody of Corrective Services on 15 February 2014.
	
	
	The Court was advised that the applicant had been in custody solely referable to this matter since 16 June 2014, with other periods of incarceration referable to earlier offences.
	


The Subjective Case


	
	Tendered to the sentencing court by the applicant was a psychiatric report from Dr Jonathon Adams and two character references.
	
	
	Dr Adams saw the applicant once via audio-visual link on 15 September 2014 for the purpose of preparing a report for use on sentence. The applicant was then aged 20 years.
	
	
	The applicant described himself as a generally happy person, although he conceded using alcohol to excess and becoming aggressive and disrespectful under its influence. Although he had seen a psychologist at age 17 for assistance with his excessive consumption of alcohol and subsequent anger, and found the techniques there given to him of assistance in controlling his anger, he acknowledged having relapsed in terms of alcohol use.
	
	
	The applicant denied any symptomology consistent with a psychiatric disorder. His health was good.
	
	
	He admitted smoking cannabis from age 14 or 15, but denied any symptoms of drug induced psychosis. He had previously experimented with cocaine and ecstasy, but not for some years. He had, however, used alcohol consistently on weekends to intoxication, and found that he became irritable and aggressive when drunk.
	
	
	The applicant was born in Sydney to a Greek father and a New Zealand mother and, although his parents had separated when he was a baby, he described his childhood as having been good. He was educated to School Certificate level and had done part of his Higher School Certificate studies through TAFE, leaving to pursue work opportunities.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the current offence the applicant was employed part-time in the construction industry with a maternal relative. He had been living with his mother at Bondi. He was subject to the suspended sentence from the District Court, and awaiting sentence in both the Local and District Courts.
	
	
	The applicant told Dr Adams that on the afternoon of 13 December 2013 he began drinking beer and spirits. He additionally smoked cannabis. He recalled leaving his home with his cousin and a friend, but claimed to have no real memory thereafter. He said he had been “feeling good.”
	
	
	The applicant said he vaguely recalled trying to buy a kebab in a kebab shop, and later jumping a fence in a roadway, but had no memory of what followed. He ascribed his memory loss to his state of intoxication.
	
	
	Of the offence he said, “…it’s turned my life upside down, plus his life,” and expressed the hope that his victim would forgive him. He attributed his offence to his level of intoxication.
	
	
	He said that he kept his spirits up whilst in custody with exercise, socialising with other prisoners, and attendance at church. He denied any drug use in prison, and had seen a drug and alcohol counsellor when in juvenile detention. He planned to pursue such counselling in the future, and also to seek out assistance with anger management.
	
	
	Dr Adams concluded that the applicant did not have any mental illness or mood disorder, although his reported alcohol and cannabis use is in keeping with a substance abuse disorder. He believed that the applicant would benefit from psychological therapy to address drug and alcohol rehabilitation and assist him to develop strategies to avoid offending behaviour.
	
	
	The personal references (from a neighbour and from an officer from the Waverley Action for Youth Services organisation) spoke positively of the applicant. The applicant’s neighbour found him to be a polite and helpful young man. The youth worker, who had known the applicant all his life, regarded him as a bright and honest young man who was a good student when not distracted. Alcohol and drugs were, however, acknowledged as serious issues for the applicant to confront.
	
	
	Correspondence from an employment agency confirmed that the applicant had undertaken and almost finished a course in warehousing.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing court.
	
	
	The applicant affirmed the truth of the history that he had given Dr Adams. He said that he had no memory of the offence but accepted the descriptions of others of his conduct, and had felt “very sad” on reading the victim impact statement (T8:04). He apologised to Mr McEwan and asked for his forgiveness.
	
	
	The applicant told her Honour that he believed that there was a connection between his alcohol abuse and his offending behaviour, and knew he had to seek treatment and stop drinking. He intended to seek such treatment once he had been sentenced.
	
	
	The applicant acknowledged in cross-examination that he had been given access to counselling services in fulfilment of conditions imposed upon him by the Children’s Court, but that it had not been successful. He conceded having done nothing to address his problematic substance use after being charged with the offences dealt with before Waverly Local Court, and having treated the night of 13 December 2013 as his last ‘big night out’ with his friends prior to being sentenced the following Monday.
	
	
	His counsel acknowledged in submissions that the applicant’s history of offending, and the commission of the offence whilst subject to a suspended control order and community service order disentitled him to leniency (T18:20). He additionally conceded that the applicant had crossed the road to “engage” the victim (T20:12).
	


The Sentence Judgment


	
	Sentence proceedings were heard on 2 October 2014 and her Honour imposed sentence on 10 October 2014.
	
	
	After setting out the agreed facts of the offence, her Honour concluded that an important feature of those facts was that the applicant had deliberately sought out the victim, to the extent of crossing the road, to attack him with a blow of some force, at a time when Mr McEwan’s physical stance indicated that he did not want confrontation. She regarded the applicant’s final act of stomping on the unconscious victim as he lay on the ground as a “particularly despicable and cowardly act” (T4). Her Honour referred to the severe and life threatening injuries gratuitously inflicted upon Mr McEwan by the applicant, which would certainly have been fatal but for medical intervention, and to the long term detriment to him.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the offence involved a high level of objective gravity and fell well above the mid-range for such an offence.
	
	
	The sentencing judge next turned to the applicant’s personal circumstances, setting out the detail of his criminal history, and his history for offences of violence when subject to conditional liberty in the community. The sentencing judge observed that at the time of the current offence the applicant was subject to bail for the offences that involved a police pursuit, and to a suspended control order and community service order for the Darling Point offences. Her Honour noted that the applicant’s record disentitled him to leniency.
	
	
	Her Honour referred to the report of Dr Adams and to the applicant’s apparent understanding of the link between his excessive consumption of alcohol and his history of offending. She noted the support available to him from family and others, but found his prospects of rehabilitation difficult to assess, in that they were dependent upon the applicant making good his stated intention to address his alcohol and drug problems. Her Honour concluded that, if the applicant did as he proposed, his prospects of achieving rehabilitation were reasonable.
	
	
	Referring to the applicant’s youth and the need for rehabilitation to be given emphasis in the exercise of the sentencing discretion for young offenders, her Honour noted what had fallen from this Court in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120; (2014) 243 A Crim R 31 wherein it was held that general deterrence had to be given substantial weight to deter intoxicated young men from acts of violence in the street. Having regard to the applicant’s criminal history, her Honour concluded that specific deterrence and denunciation were also important.
	
	
	The utilitarian value of the plea of guilty entered by the applicant to the offence before the Local Court was recognised by a discount of 25% on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	Her Honour considered the principle of totality having regard to the expiration on 15 June 2014 of the non-parole period of the sentence imposed upon the applicant upon revocation of a suspended control order, but concluded that there was no basis for concurrency with that sentence.
	
	
	Although a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was made, the finding reflected the requirements of totality rather than a need for a longer non-parole period, and the adjustment to the usual statutory ratio was slight.
	


The Application for Leave to Appeal

Ground One: The learned judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in drawing adverse inferences of fact which were not open beyond reasonable doubt


	
	The adverse inference of fact that the applicant complains the sentencing judge wrongly drew is twofold: that the applicant “…deliberately sought out another young man, in that he crossed the road to attack him”; and, that he struck the victim with an elbow “…with such force that he fell backwards so heavily that he sustained a very severe head injury.”
	
	
	In the applicant’s written submissions (“AWS”), written by Ms Moen rather than by counsel who appeared before us, Mr Flynn, it is asserted that there was no evidence that the applicant crossed the road to attack the victim, and the concession made by counsel during the proceedings on sentence, that the applicant crossed the road to “engage” the victim, was not defined and was capable of many meanings. It was submitted that it was not open to her Honour to find as she did beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	This ground can be dealt with quickly since it is an empty argument of semantics and not one of substance. Contrary to the argument in the AWS, both the agreed facts and counsel’s concession entitled her Honour to find the facts as she did.
	
	
	The facts referred to the involvement of the applicant’s associate, Mr Ennis, in an argument with the victim that moved along the roadway, which ended at the bus shelter when Mr Ennis was pulled away by a witness. To reach the scene of the altercation, the applicant had to move over or through a metal fence separating the lanes of opposing traffic on Campbell Parade, walk around behind the bus shelters and then into the bus shelter where Mr McEwan was standing, gesturing as to his unwillingness to involve himself in confrontation. The applicant’s movement suggests deliberation and intent of purpose.
	
	
	On reaching Mr McEwan, and despite the victim’s gesture of peaceful intent, the applicant immediately struck him a blow of sufficient force to knock him off his feet. There was no preceding conversation or exchange of any sort.
	
	
	Only one other possible explanation for the applicant’s conduct was suggested in the AWS, being an intention to engage verbally with Mr McEwan. That possibility is precluded by the fact that there were no words spoken by the applicant at all; he moved immediately to Mr McEwan and hit him. Since there was nothing preventing him from speaking to Mr McEwan, it could not have been his intention to do so.
	
	
	The purposeful movement of the applicant in scaling the fence and striking Mr McEwan immediately on coming up to him is evidence upon which it was open to her Honour to infer that such was the applicant’s intent when he crossed the road and moved towards him.
	
	
	Counsel’s concession during the sentence proceedings makes that plain. The contention in the AWS that counsel was not asked to define the word he used to describe the applicant’s intention in crossing the road, “engage”, ignores the context in which the concession was made, that being an exchange between the sentencing judge and counsel as to whether the offence was planned. With that as the background, her Honour asked the applicant’s counsel (T20:09):
	


“He sought him out though didn’t he? […] Didn’t your client seek out the victim?”


	
	The response to that question (T20:12-17) as it went to the level of planning was:
	


“From across the other side of the road – the victim is engaged in an affray of some description [an entirely incorrect characterisation on the evidence, there being no suggestion Mr McEwan was involved in any wrongdoing] with the offender’s friend. He sees that and he crosses the road to engage the victim. Once again, that’s conceded. The level of planning involved in that your Honour, is it’s much less than it would if he was, for example, sitting at home, well I’m going to go and get this particular person ...”


	
	In that exchange, counsel was clearly contrasting a crime planned to the extent of formulating the intention when elsewhere and then seeking the victim out, and one planned from the short distance of “across the road”.
	
	
	Having regard to the agreed facts, counsel’s concession was an appropriate one, and the applicant is bound by it: Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460, at [81].
	
	
	The second asserted error seems to rely upon interpreting the sentencing judge’s reference to “such force” that the victim fell backwards heavily, as a reference to a high or extreme level of force. There is no basis for reading the impugned sentence in the way contended by the applicant. The reference to “such force” by the sentencing judge meant no more than that the degree of force was sufficient to lead to the consequence, that being that Mr McEwan fell back heavily and struck the ground, receiving a significant head injury.
	
	
	That conclusion was inevitable and there can be no error in it.
	
	
	This proposed ground is not made out.
	


Ground Two: The learned judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in failing to take into account four months the applicant spent in adult custody solely referable to this offence prior to the commencement date of the sentence


	
	The applicant asserts that the sentencing judge failed to take into account a material consideration, being the fact that he was subjected to what is described in the AWS as “additional punishment” (p 4), being four months spent on remand in an adult gaol, when also serving what remained of the non-parole period of the control order imposed on 16 December 2013 following breach of the suspended control order. The “additional punishment” is a reference to the contrast between time spent in an adult gaol and time spent in a juvenile detention facility.
	
	
	The applicant commenced serving the control order on 16 December 2013, an order served in a juvenile detention facility. On 14 February 2014 he was charged with the current offence, and refused bail by the Local Court. After he was remanded in custody the applicant was transferred from the detention centre in which he had been housed to a remand facility operated by the Department of Corrective Services. He remained in such custody serving the balance of the control order, and on remand for the present offence.
	
	
	The applicant’s argument before this Court is that the transfer of the applicant to an adult prison from a juvenile detention facility represents “additional punishment” which should have been taken into account by the sentencing judge when fixing the sentence to be imposed upon him, and reflected by some diminution of sentence or concurrency with the control order.
	
	
	The first thing to note about this asserted error is that the sentencing judge was never asked to allow the applicant some specific benefit on sentence to reflect the changed conditions of his custody upon remand for this offence. Nor was any evidence called before the sentencing court as to the practical differences between a juvenile detention facility and a gaol, or the differing conditions of custody. Although the applicant gave evidence, the only distinction he drew between juvenile and adult custody was that he had seen a doctor about his alcohol consumption whilst at the Frank Baxter Centre, but was unable to access counselling whilst on remand (T11). There was no reference in evidence or submission to the change of custodial environment as relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Reference was earlier made to the authority of Zreika: an appeal to this Court is not an opportunity for a second chance at presenting a case to a sentencing court. In the absence of error leading to a miscarriage of justice that cannot go uncorrected, an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence to this Court is ordinarily bound by the case he or she presented on sentence at first instance. It is not to the point that newly appointed counsel would have made different submissions or presented the case in a different way, or that counsel asked to prepare a matter for appeal and searching for a basis to contend for error devises a new argument that could have been put at first instance but was not.
	
	
	A sentencing judge could rarely be found to be in error for not doing that which he or she was not asked to do.
	
	
	Even without her Honour being specifically referred to the issue here, the matter was generally considered by her in the context of totality, with her Honour concluding that there should be no concurrence between the sentence she imposed and that imposed on 16 December 2013.
	
	
	Since there was no basis for concurrency in the facts of the two sets of offences (see Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41) and the principal of totality did not demand a degree of concurrency, the course adopted by her Honour, to commence the current sentence at the expiration of the earlier non-parole period, was entirely open to her.
	
	
	The sentencing judge did make a finding of special circumstances consistent with the totality principle, which resulted in a reduction in the non-parole period that would otherwise have applied of almost four months.
	
	
	Had her Honour allowed the degree of concurrency suggested in the AWS by directing the sentence commence on 14 February 2014, the applicant would have served just two months imprisonment for stabbing a young man twice in the stomach. Such a result would have been contrary to the interests of justice.
	
	
	This proposed ground has not been made good.
	


Ground Three: The sentence is manifestly excessive


	
	The applicant’s argument in support of this ground is that the notional starting point for the sentence imposed, prior to the application of the discount on sentence of 25%, must have been one of 9 years imprisonment, and that this is manifestly excessive having regard to the applicant’s youth, remorse and favourable prospects for rehabilitation.
	
	
	This ground must be determined in light of well settled and long standing authority that holds that sentencing judges are to be allowed as much flexibility as is consonant with the proper application of sentencing principles and consistency of approach: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [28] and Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15].
	
	
	In any sentencing exercise there will be a range of possible sentences that could be imposed without error; the fact that a sentence falls at the upper end, or even at the top of, the available range does not make it manifestly excessive, any more than a sentence at the lowest end of the range is necessarily manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Despite the caution which this Court frequently urges on the use of sentencing statistics, statistics for the period January 2008 to June 2015 are relied upon in the AWS to make good the argument. The applicant highlights one of the cases caught by the statistics cited, Passaris v R [2011] NSWCCA 216; (2011) 82 NSWLR 546.
	
	
	Sentencing statistics do no more than show a range of sentences imposed on other offenders charged with the same offence in the past. They say nothing about the facts of the particular cases, or the personal circumstances of the particular offenders. They permit no meaningful comparison or analysis.
	
	
	Additionally, they can present a somewhat skewed picture, since they encompass sentences held to be inadequate on appeal but nevertheless allowed to stand by an appellate court in the exercise of its residual discretion.
	
	
	In the present case, statistics are markedly inapposite because the available statistics do not provide for a category of offender (which the applicant falls within) who was subject to multiple forms of conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offence, one of which was for a similar prior offence.
	
	
	In the applicant’s case, the sentencing judge had to impose sentence for a gravely serious example of an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period, still relevant as a guidepost despite the applicant’s guilty plea, of 4 years.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the offence was one of a high level of objective gravity, well above the middle of any notional range of seriousness. That finding was open to her having regard to the following features of the matter:
	



	
	The fact that the applicant sought out his victim, crossing a road with the intention of attacking him;
	
	
	He did so after the verbal altercation between the victim and the applicant’s friend had ended;
	
	
	He violently attacked a man who was clearly indicating that he wanted no trouble;
	
	
	He delivered a blow sufficiently forceful to knock the victim from his feet so that his head collided with the ground;
	
	
	Having knocked his victim to the ground, and when he was unconscious and completely unable to defend himself, the applicant delivered another forceful blow with his foot to the victim’s chest;
	
	
	The injuries occasioned to Mr McEwan were severe, and would have been fatal had it not been for timely and comprehensive medical intervention; and
	
	
	Mr McEwan has been left with some level of permanent impairment, with cognitive decline.
	



	
	The seriousness of the offence called for a stern sentence. The fact that human ingenuity and imagination may be able to suggest a more serious version of an offence of this type does not diminish the gravity of this particular example.
	
	
	Her Honour had also to consider the applicant’s subjective case, but there was nothing in his personal circumstances which dictated any significant amelioration of sentence.
	
	
	Whilst youth was a feature to be considered, it had to be balanced against the need for denunciation of the particular offence, and the significant role for both specific and general deterrence to play in the sentencing exercise. The fact that the applicant was subject to bail and a suspended control order at the time of the offending was a matter of serious aggravation.
	
	
	In recent dicta from this Court youth has been held to be a feature of lesser relevance than that of general deterrence where offences of street violence are concerned, offences typically committed by young men emboldened by excessive consumption of alcohol. In R v Loveridge, at [103] – [105], the Court said:
	


“103. Other decisions of this Court have emphasised that violence on the streets, especially by young men in company and under the influence of alcohol and drugs, is all too common and needs to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at 101 [29]. Even in the case of juvenile offenders (which the Respondent is not), this Court has emphasised that, in relation to crimes of violence committed in the streets by groups of young persons, general deterrence should be given substantial weight notwithstanding the youth of the offenders: AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [69]; MB v R [2013] NSWCCA 254 at [27].

104. This Court has emphasised that the principles of general deterrence and denunciation of crimes serve as a means of protection of the public: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [92].

105. The use of lethal force against a vulnerable, unsuspecting and innocent victim on a public street in the course of alcohol-fuelled aggression accompanied, as it was, by other non-fatal attacks by the Respondent upon vulnerable, unsuspecting and innocent citizens in the crowded streets of King Cross on a Saturday evening, called for the express and demonstrable application of the element of general deterrence as a powerful factor on sentence in this case.”


	
	Although rehabilitation was a relevant consideration, it is not accurate to say, as the applicant does in his written submissions, that his prospects in that regard were favourable. As her Honour noted, the applicant had been extended considerable leniency by sentencing courts in the past, and given the opportunity to access anger management and drug and alcohol counselling in the community. He had not made the most of the opportunities extended to him. His prospects for the future were entirely dependent upon the applicant himself, and whether he was prepared to make good his stated intention to address his substance abuse and offending conduct.
	
	
	In short, the subjective case was not such as to ameliorate the penalty to be imposed upon the applicant.
	
	
	I am not able to conclude that the sentence imposed upon the applicant is unfair or unjust. Accordingly, this ground has not been made out.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having regard to the applicant’s relative youth, and the length of sentence imposed upon him, I would grant leave to appeal, but I would not uphold it. Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal; and
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.

2701461,Batty v R [2016] NSWCCA 121,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Garling J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed order.
	
	
	GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed in the District Court of NSW by his Honour Judge Woods QC on 10 June 2015.
	
	
	The applicant, Steven James Batty, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (“the DMT Act”) of supplying a prohibited drug on 18 June 2014. He was committed for sentence to the District Court. In the District Court he adhered to his plea of guilty.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 10 years. No standard non-parole period applies.
	
	
	On 10 June 2015, the sentencing Judge imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. The sentences were to take effect from 9 September 2015, being the date of the expiration of a term of imprisonment which the applicant was then serving.
	
	
	On 19 June 2015, the matter was relisted before the sentencing Judge because of a need to correct the date upon which the sentence was fixed to commence. On that date the sentencing Judge imposed the same sentence, consisting of a 2 year non-parole period and a balance of term of 2 years, but ordered that the sentence commence on 19 March 2015.
	


Facts


	
	A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge. The facts were as follows.
	
	
	In mid-2014, police based at Gosford conducted a covert operation into the distribution of illegal drugs on the Central Coast of NSW.
	
	
	On 17 June 2014, police investigators were granted a search warrant for premises at Mardi. The property was a large home situated on several acres containing 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and a large shed.
	
	
	The police were satisfied from their enquiries that the applicant and his partner resided at the property. The applicant was renting the property for $600 per week.
	
	
	The warrant was executed on 18 June 2014. At the time of execution no one was present at the property, and access was obtained lawfully by police officers. A systematic search of the premises was undertaken. The search was, in accordance with the usual practice, electronically recorded.
	
	
	Located within the linen cupboard in the downstairs part of the property was a large removalist box. Within that removalist box, police located 12 “cryovac” packages containing cannabis. Each of these packages weighed between 450gms and 463gms. This weight is commonly known as a “pound” in drug dealing parlance. Each of the packages had been marked with a different number. In total the 12 packages of cannabis weighed 5.47kg.
	
	
	During the search of the premises police located in the garage a cryovac machine which was able to seal items in the same way as the packages of cannabis that had been seized.
	
	
	That same day, the applicant was contacted by police investigators. The applicant informed the police that he intended to drive north from Sydney towards his residence that afternoon. At about 4.20pm, police investigators observed the applicant driving his motor vehicle on the M1 Motorway. The vehicle was stopped by highway patrol police officers approximately 100m north of the Kariong-Gosford Exit.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested and cautioned. He was then taken to the Gosford Police Station and informed of his rights in accordance with standard protocols. He was offered the opportunity to participate in an electronically recorded interview, which he declined. He was then charged with the offence.
	


Proceedings on Sentence


	
	Sentence proceedings were held on 5 June 2015 before Wood DCJ.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report had been ordered, but was not available at the time the proceedings on sentence commenced. Mr Singh-Panwar, the applicant’s solicitor, informed the Court that his client wished to proceed notwithstanding the absence of a pre-sentence report.
	
	
	The Crown tendered the Agreed Facts, a Crown sentence summary, the criminal record of the applicant and his custodial history.
	
	
	Mr Sing-Panwar, on behalf of the applicant, tendered a report of Dr Susan Pulman, a Specialist Clinical and Forensic Neuropsychologist, dated 18 August 2009. The applicant also tendered a report of Mr Lee Knight, a Clinical Nurse Consultant in Forensic Mental Health, dated 2 June 2015. A number of authorities were provided to the Court. Thereafter, submissions were made.
	
	
	Nor oral evidence was called.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	On 10 June 2015, Woods DCJ sentenced the applicant. His Honour identified the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty as well as the maximum penalty. He noted that the quantity of cannabis the subject of the charge was 5.47kg. His Honour noted that the drugs were found in the possession of the applicant but, by reason of the quantity of drugs in his possession, he was charged with the offence of deemed supply. His Honour noted that the indictable quantity for cannabis was 1kg, and that the quantity of cannabis in the applicant’s possession was “significantly below” the commercial quantity of 25kg.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the offence for which he was sentencing the applicant was committed whilst the applicant was on parole for a previous offence. His Honour recorded that the applicant’s parole had been revoked and that the balance of his sentence with respect to that offence was to expire on 9 September 2015.
	
	
	His Honour adequately recounted the facts, before moving to consider the subjective circumstances of the applicant. His Honour referred in particular to the report prepared by Dr Susan Pulman. His Honour recorded that the most significant aspect of this report was that it indicated that the applicant had an overall IQ of 78, indicating that the applicant was a person with “… some cognitive difficulties”.
	
	
	His Honour recorded Dr Pulman’s conclusion, which he accepted, that the applicant’s history of head injuries and substance abuse had resulted in some cognitive deficiencies. His Honour accepted Dr Pulman’s opinion that the applicant demonstrated considerable difficulty in grasping the concept inherent in a task which Dr Pulman requested of him. His Honour accepted the following expression of opinion by Dr Pulman:
	


“[The Applicant] continued to perseverate despite being provided with feedback that his response was incorrect.”


	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant was not mentally ill, nor was he “so mentally retarded that he does not know what he was doing”. His Honour concluded that the presence of the cryovac packages indicated that the applicant intended to supply the drugs, and noted that the plea of guilty was made on that basis.
	
	
	His Honour recorded the plea of guilty, and noted that it indicated some measure of contrition and provided some assistance in the administration of justice.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt with a question of parity advanced by reference to another offender, Mr Bailey, who had been arrested in the course of the same police operation and sentenced by his Honour a few weeks earlier. His Honour noted that Mr Bailey had been charged with supplying cannabis in a quantity of 1.84kg, for which he had been sentenced to a 2 year non-parole period with a balance of term of a further 2 years.
	
	
	His Honour rejected the proposition that principles of parity were to be applied between Mr Bailey and the applicant. His Honour took the view that Mr Bailey and the applicant were not strictly co-offenders His Honour said that there was insufficient similarity in their offending to warrant consideration of parity.
	
	
	His Honour went on to say this:
	


“The simple fact is that Mr Batty was found with a substantial quantity of cannabis in his premises, under his control, plainly intended for supply. Nothing other than a substantial and significant sentence of imprisonment is appropriate, notwithstanding the fact that he is not to be regarded as a criminal mastermind. I accept that he is not.”


	
	His Honour allowed a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty and then imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.
	
	
	His Honour found special circumstances, being the applicant’s mental condition, particular difficulties with cognition and the need for an extended period of supervision. His Honour ordered that the drugs found at the applicant’s premises be destroyed.
	
	
	His Honour fixed the sentence to commence on 9 September 2015, which was the expiration date of the sentence which the applicant was already serving.
	
	
	As has earlier been recorded, about a week later the commencement date of the sentence was amended to 19 March 2015.
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	On 10 February 2016, the applicant lodged a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.
	
	
	The applicant nominated one ground, namely:
	


“His Honour’s discretion miscarried in his consideration of the commencement date of the sentence, resulting in the double punishment of the applicant for the fact that the offences were committed whilst on parole.” (sic)

Applicant’s Submissions


	
	The applicant’s primary submission was that the length of the sentence imposed, combined with the commencement date, indicated that the sentencing Judge imposed a double punishment upon the applicant by (i) taking into account as an aggravating factor the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole; and (ii) partially accumulating the sentence upon the balance of the parole period. The applicant reasoned that while the sentence was not manifestly excessive, it was at the higher end of the range for offences of this kind. Accordingly, the Court ought to infer that the sentencing Judge treated as an aggravating factor the applicant’s commission of the offence whilst on parole although this was not specifically stated by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	The applicant conceded that he was to be sentenced on the basis that the drugs found in his possession were for the purpose of supply. He conceded that his motivation for engaging in drug supply was financial gain, as his small business was not thriving.
	
	
	The applicant noted that his Honour made no specific finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence. The applicant also noted that in the course of the Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing Judge correctly found that the applicant was not a criminal mastermind. The applicant submits that because the quantity of drugs involved was considerably below the commercial quantity, the offence was not at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The applicant accepts that the degree of severity of his mental condition is modest, but nevertheless argues that the sentencing Judge failed to apply the principles set out in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, with the result that his Honour imposed a sentence that was at the upper end of the range.
	
	
	The applicant accepted that a sentencing court has a broad discretion in sentencing offenders for offences committed while on parole. Nevertheless, the applicant submits that in exercising that discretion, a court must take care not to engage in double counting or double punishment if it considers the applicant’s commission of the offence while on parole to be an aggravating factor.
	
	
	In respect of double punishment, the applicant drew attention to several decisions of this Court, in particular the judgment of Basten JA in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66, where his Honour considered the question of the appropriate commencement date for a sentence to be imposed for an offence committed whilst on parole. Basten JA said at [35]:
	


“In circumstances where the offences constitute the reason for the revocation of parole, it is important not to double count the fact that the offences were committed whilst serving an incomplete sentence for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence. It is also necessary to consider whether there should be a degree of concurrency, to allow for the possibility that the respondent could have been re-paroled during the course of the balance of term on the earlier offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at [21]-[23] (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing).”


	
	In light of these authorities, the applicant submitted that there were a number of matters which the sentencing Judge ought to have considered in setting an appropriate commencement date for the sentence, including:
	



	
	the significant period that the applicant was on parole prior to the offending, being over 20 months from 9 October 2012 until 18 June 2014;
	
	
	the applicant was not in breach of his parole for reasons other than the commission of the subject offence;
	
	
	the lengthy balance of the sentence after the revocation of parole, being 1 year 2 months 23 days; and
	
	
	the sentencing proceedings occurred on 10 June 2015, when the applicant had already served 12 months of the balance of his sentence.
	



	
	Based on those considerations, the applicant submitted that the sentencing Judge’s discretion had miscarried.
	


The Crown Submissions


	
	The Crown’s first submission was that the sentencing Judge did not make a specific finding that the applicant’s commission of the offence while on parole was an aggravating factor. The Crown noted that the applicant’s solicitor had conceded before the sentencing Judge that the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was “… otherwise aggravated by his being on conditional liberty”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge relevantly took into account a range of matters which were open for discretionary evaluation and assessment, and that no error is apparent on the face of the Remarks on Sentence.
	
	
	Insofar as the Crown dealt with the question of the overall length of the sentence, the Crown pointed to the following factors as indicating that the sentence was well within an appropriate range, and that no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Those factors were that:
	



	
	the maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years;
	
	
	the amount of cannabis involved, being 5.47kg, was more than five times the indictable quantity of 1kg;
	
	
	the applicant had a record of serious offending in relation to drugs; and
	
	
	the applicant was on parole at the time of his offending.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that leave ought be refused.
	


Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances


	
	The applicant was born in 1966 and was 49 at the time of his sentencing. His criminal history commenced when he was about 18 years old, whilst he was living in Queensland. His first recorded offence in NSW was in 1995 for an offence of stealing from a dwelling.
	
	
	Thereafter the applicant committed a series of offences for larceny which were dealt with either by recognisance or a community service order. He failed to comply with the recognisance and the community service order and was dealt with by a further community service order.
	
	
	In 2008, the applicant was arrested in south-western NSW, where he was charged with an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months commencing on 10 March 2008 and concluding on 9 September 2015. His non-parole period was fixed at 4 years and 7 months. It therefore expired on 9 October 2012.
	
	
	The applicant was released from custody on 9 October 2012 pursuant to a parole order. On 10 July 2014, shortly after he was arrested for the present offence, the State Parole Authority met and revoked the parole order. Consequently, the applicant was required to serve the balance of his parole, commencing on 18 June 2014, the date of his arrest, and expiring on 9 September 2015.
	
	
	It is convenient to note the expert material that was before the sentencing Judge concerning the applicant’s subjective circumstances. The earlier report of Dr Susan Pulman noted that the applicant’s parents separated when he was about 5 years old. He apparently did not have a close relationship with his father. He and his two siblings were raised by his mother, with whom he has a close relationship.
	
	
	The applicant, prior to 2009, had been in a relationship for 5½ years. He and his partner had 3 children from that relationship.
	
	
	Dr Pulman concluded:
	


“Whereas Mr Batty’s full scale IQ falls within the borderline range, his performance on measures of auditory and visual memory fell predominantly within the extremely low range. … Mr Batty’s general memory index score is considered the best overall measure of the types of abilities that are critical to effective memory and day to day tasks. Less than 2% of the normal population demonstrates a disparity between obtained and predicted scores on this index, the magnitude evident and the present case.

… In summary, the cognitive deficits demonstrated by Mr Batty including poor working memory and processing speed, impaired auditory and visual memory and difficulty in higher order reasoning are consistent with the neuropsychological sequelae often observed following a history of traumatic brain injury.”


	
	A report prepared for the sentencing proceedings by Mr Lee Knight indicated that at the time of his arrest, the applicant was experiencing financial distress and significant relationship issues.
	
	
	The applicant informed Mr Knight that he was a social drinker who used cannabis between the ages of 13 and 16, and other drugs including amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy at various times between the ages of 18 and 40. He told Mr Knight that, by 2015, he was not engaged in any illicit substance abuse or dependence and that he was free of drug use.
	
	
	Mr Knight concluded:
	


“Mr Batty has previous diagnoses of personality vulnerabilities (possibly complex post-traumatic stress disorder), anxiety and cognitive impairment. He is currently treated with an oral anti-depressant medication that is assisting him, to some degree, with his anxiety symptoms. He continues to suffer from residual symptoms of his anxiety disorder, namely avoidance of social situations and regular feelings of panic.

…

Mr Batty’s level of cognitive impairment reduces his working memory and processing speed. He has impairment in auditory and visual memory. His higher order reasoning is also impaired, which would affect his ability to make reasoned judgments and cause him to have difficulties with problem solving.

Mr Batty appears to avoid social situations as they almost always make him feel anxious. He is aware of how his cognitive impairment affects his interaction with others so avoids circumstances where he has to converse with others.”


	
	Mr Knight made certain recommendations with respect to the applicant.
	


Discernment


	
	An appropriate starting point in considering the submissions of the applicant is the notional sentences that were imposed prior to the discount applied for the applicant’s plea of guilty.
	
	
	The notional sentences were 5 years and 4 months, being the total sentence, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. The maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period applies. The maximum sentence was one of the legislative guideposts to which the sentencing Judge was obliged to have regard.
	
	
	The next factor to be considered is that the applicant accepts that the sentence was not manifestly excessive and, therefore, that there is no latent error in the sentencing Judge’s reasoning.
	
	
	The applicant then submitted that it is apparent from the Agreed Facts, that although the sentencing Judge did not make a finding about the objective seriousness of the offence, and no complaint of error is made in this respect, this Court ought to regard the applicant’s offence as being towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.
	
	
	Against those background facts, the applicant submits that by reference to the total sentence as being towards the top of the range of sentences which had in the past been imposed, this Court ought to conclude that the sentencing Judge erroneously double counted the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole, by taking it into account as an aggravating factor on the one hand and by partially accumulating the sentence on the balance of the parole period on the other.
	
	
	The applicant accepts, as is necessary, that the sentencing process, which is an evaluative one, comprises two principal evaluative and discretionary elements relevant here, namely the extent to which the sentence can or ought be backdated, and the weight to be given to the applicant’s commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty.
	
	
	I have concluded that it is impossible to reason in the way applicant contends to demonstrate an erroneous conclusion on the part of the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	In the particular circumstances here, the sentencing Judge was entitled to accumulate the sentence which he imposed on the parole period. It was a matter for him to determine the extent of accumulation. As well, it was a matter for the sentencing Judge to determine the extent to which the applicant’s commission of the offence while on conditional liberty was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	Sentencing is a process of instinctive synthesis. The process was described by McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [51] in these terms:
	


“By instinctive synthesis, I mean the method of sentencing by which the judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. Only at the end of the process does the judge determine the sentence.”


	
	Here, that is the approach which the sentencing Judge followed. It is not possible to reason from the sentence imposed by his Honour that one or other factor was given such weight in the process as to demonstrate error.
	
	
	I am unpersuaded that the ground of appeal succeeds. I am unpersuaded that the appeal has any merit. The sentence imposed was well within the discretionary range open to the sentencing Judge. No lesser sentence is warranted.
	
	
	No basis has been demonstrated for a grant of leave to appeal.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal refused.
	



	
	FAGAN J: I agree with Garling J.

2701464,R v Colless (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 932,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	To state the problem that has arisen in a nutshell, on the voir dire it is accepted that, when he was cross-examined by defence counsel, the Crown witness Mr Harris said that after the alleged incident at the KFC he heard the accused on the phone, and he heard the accused use the phrase “sort it out”. That evidence was given by Mr Harris on oath less than an hour ago.
	
	
	When he was asked about that In front of the jury, his position was that he could not recall any particular words that were said.
	
	
	It is accepted by defence counsel that the situation that has arisen falls within at least one of the “legs” of s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  But she has submitted that, if I look to the “leave factors” contained in s 192 of the same Act, I would not grant leave.
	
	
	Secondly, in light of the fact that the witness (who, in the past at least, had a reasonably close association with the accused’s family) has referred to his own use of a notorious prohibited drug, any attempt by her to cross-examine the witness about this seeming contradiction could give rise to further potential prejudice to her client.
	
	
	I think that, in the main, the “leave factors” in s 192 militate in favour of a grant of leave.
	
	
	I say that because, with regard to factor s 192(2)(a), the questions could be asked by the Crown in a matter of seconds.
	
	
	Secondly, it has been clear that for quite some time Mr Harris may well say something to this effect, and I do not think that the evidence, especially bearing in mind its exploration on the voir dire, would be unfair to the accused, if it were led in this way: s 192(2)(b).
	
	
	Thirdly, I understand this evidence to be important and to be accepted by defence counsel to be important, in that, assisted as I am by the openings which were received yesterday, it seems that this alleged campaign of harassment and the accused’s alleged responses to it before the fatal incident will be important with regard to a number of issues, not least voluntariness, possibly intention for murder, and seemingly self-defence: s 192(2)(c).
	
	
	Fourthly, the nature of the proceeding, bearing in mind its gravity, I think argues in favour of a fuller, rather than less full, exploration of evidence: s 192(2)(d).
	
	
	Finally, in the circumstances, I do not think that adjourning this hearing or making any other order is a reasonably practical way forward: s 192(2)(e).
	
	
	I think there is some force in the proposition that possibly repeated references to prohibited drugs by Mr Harris could occasion prejudice to the accused. But that possibility, to my mind, should not stand in the way of the Crown application being granted: s 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to permit the Crown prosecutor to cross-examine the witness about the seeming contradiction between what he said in the witness box a moment ago, and what he said on the voir dire less than an hour ago.

		05 July 2016",2016-06-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701466,Abdul-Hamid v R [2016] NSWCCA 118,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with Wilson J that the Court should refuse leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in the District Court on 5 June 2015.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 5 February 2015 the applicant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Arnott SC, sitting without a jury, upon an indictment charging him with an offence contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) that, between 17 and 18 July 2013 [1]  at Narwee in this State, he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being methylamphetamine. Section 29 of that Act was relied upon by the Crown in proof of the charge.
	
	
	The applicant entered a plea of not guilty. On 11 February 2015 at the conclusion of the trial, his Honour returned a verdict of guilty. The offence of which the applicant was found guilty carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, a fine of 2000 penalty units, or both.
	
	
	The applicant was convicted on 5 June 2015 and a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years was imposed upon him. The sentence commenced on 11 December 2014 and expires on 10 December 2019; a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment was fixed, which expires on 10 December 2017.
	
	
	The applicant seeks to appeal against that sentence. He advances a single ground:
	



	
	“The learned sentencing judge erred in the assessment of objective gravity of the offence, in particular by finding that:
	



	
	The applicant knew the quantity of drugs, which were to be purchased by Ibrahim; and
	
	
	The applicant played a more significant role than Ibrahim.”
	



	
	There is no appeal against conviction.
	


The Facts of the Applicant’s Crime


	
	The matter having proceeded as a trial, it was for the sentencing judge to find the facts of the applicant’s crime consistent with the verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Some of the facts of the offence were not in dispute. His Honour found the facts against the applicant as follows.
	
	
	In July 2013 a police operation investigating the supply of prohibited drugs in the Wollongong area was underway. A number of warrants were obtained to permit the police to intercept various telephone services. In the course of that electronic surveillance, conversations between the applicant and his co-offender, Ali Ibrahim, were monitored.
	
	
	Shortly before 4 pm on 17 July 2013, a telephone call between the applicant and Ibrahim was intercepted in which the applicant inquired of Ibrahim in an angry and impatient tone why he was “playing games.” He told his co-offender that he was waiting for him at a park in Wollongong. Soon after that call, Ibrahim was observed to leave his home and drive towards Wollongong.
	
	
	There were further telephone exchanges between the two as to the applicant’s precise location. The applicant was waiting for Ibrahim in his car parked near a Wollongong park. Ibrahim left the vehicle he had travelled in and joined the applicant in his car. He remained in the applicant’s car for about five minutes.
	
	
	When he got out of the car he was seen by police, who were conducting surveillance of the pair, to place a white coloured package down the front of his pants. He returned to his car and drove home. There was no dispute at trial that the package contained money, although there was a dispute as to whether the applicant had given the package to Ibrahim and how much money it contained. The sentencing judge concluded that the package contained money, and that the applicant had given it to Ibrahim in a brief exchange in his car. His Honour was not able to determine whether the applicant supplied the whole of the monies used the following day to purchase drugs or only a part of it, nor was he able to conclude the amount of money involved.
	
	
	The following day, 18 July 2013, there were a number of telephone calls between the applicant and Ibrahim. In one call shortly before 9.30am the applicant demanded that Ibrahim come to his house immediately (“Oy, come to my house right now bro’”), and Ibrahim said he would. The applicant, speaking in Arabic, told him, “Okay, come and bring the other thing.”
	
	
	Soon after, Ibrahim left his home and travelled as a passenger in a car driven by his cousin to the applicant’s house. He went inside and remained there for a matter of minutes.
	
	
	On leaving, Ibrahim was driven by his cousin to Narwee where he collected a package containing methylamphetamine from another person. On the return journey he became concerned that he was being followed by undercover police officers and threw the package of drugs from the car window at a location in Narwee.
	
	
	A short distance away Ibrahim got out of the car, which drove off, and walked back to look for the package. Having found it, he secreted it under the fence of a house. He was observed by surveillance police as these events unfolded.
	
	
	The co-offender walked around the streets of Narwee for almost an hour before being picked up by his cousin and driven to Arncliffe. At Arncliffe, Ibrahim left the car and went to a hairdressing salon. From that location he made a number of telephone calls (using the salon phone) to the applicant. In one call, partly in English and partly in Arabic, Ibrahim told the applicant, “The police have followed me three cars.” The applicant asked him what he did and Ibrahim replied:
	


“I threw it and when I’m fuckin’ [unintelligible] jumped out of the car. They’ve been following me all day. […] I threw it in a house but it’s kind of covered but not covered, you know what I mean.”


	
	When Ibrahim asked the accused, “How am I going to get it,” the applicant responded:
	


“Ah, now you will go and think of something, you know what I mean?”


	
	Further discussions followed about the recovery of the package with the applicant telling Ibrahim he would use a different car and go to Narwee. In a call at 1.03pm he asked of the co-offender, “Tell me, is it, is it hidden well or not?” Soon after he told Ibrahim he would not come to Narwee as “we’re gonna get done if I come up.”
	
	
	The package was retrieved by police around 4.30 that afternoon. It contained two smaller packages of methylamphetamine, one of which contained 27.9 grams with a purity of 9.5%, and another which contained 139.9 grams with a purity of 73%. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was aware of the amount of methylamphetamine deposited by the co-offender in Narwee.
	
	
	On 23 August 2013 a search warrant was executed at the applicant’s Berkeley home. A sum of $1600 in cash was found with two identification cards in the applicant’s name, and a notebook ledger with a number of entries consistent with a “tick” book, being a list of monies owed for drugs supplied.
	
	
	Two devices designed to detect electronic signals or intercept devices were found, together with a further item consistent in appearance with a tick list, and another sum of $615 in cash in a wallet belonging to the applicant. Two sets of digital scales and a quantity of resealable plastic bags were also located.
	
	
	The mobile phone service used by the applicant in calls with Ibrahim had been connected about two weeks before these events, and was registered to a false address in a different name.
	


Other Evidence before the Sentencing Judge


	
	Since the focus of the proposed appeal is on the facts found by the sentencing judge and the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, it is unnecessary to give more than brief details of other evidence considered by his Honour in imposing sentence upon the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant was 31 years old at the time of the commission of the offence and 33 when he appeared for sentence.
	
	
	His criminal history commenced in 2000 and contained entries for driving offences, drug offences and offences of dishonesty. Of particular relevance, in 2006 the applicant was sentenced for an offence of possess prohibited drug. In 2008 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for supplying a prohibited drug. There was another offence of possess prohibited drug, in respect of which the applicant was placed on a bond for 12 months on 30 July 2013. The applicant had been on bail for this offence at the time he committed the present offence.
	
	
	A number of offences of receiving were dealt with in May 2014 in the District Court by way of suspended sentences of imprisonment and community service orders and, in August 2014 the applicant was sentenced to a further term of imprisonment for 20 months with a non-parole period of 8 months for a supply offence. He had served the non-parole period of that sentence when he appeared before his Honour in relation to this matter.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report prepared for an earlier sentence matter (in August 2014) set out the applicant’s personal circumstances, noting that the applicant grew up in a stable and supportive environment and had been married for some four years as at mid-2014. To the author of the pre-sentence report, the applicant presented as having little insight into his drug use or offending behaviour. He was assessed as having a medium level risk of re-offending. The applicant’s dependency on illicit drugs was identified as his principal challenge.
	
	
	Information as to the applicant’s health and mental state was also before his Honour. That evidence indicated that the applicant suffered from sleep apnoea and diabetes, and had a substance abuse disorder with some depressive symptoms.
	
	
	The co-offender was sentenced on 3 October 2013 having pleaded guilty to supplying a prohibited drug and another unrelated offence. For the offence in common with the applicant, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 28 months with a non–parole period of 14 months. Ibrahim was given the benefit of a 25% reduction on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in recognition of the utilitarian value of his early plea, and a finding of special circumstances.
	


The Application for Leave to Appeal


	
	As noted, the applicant’s complaint against the sentence imposed upon him is confined to asserting error by the sentencing judge in the fact finding exercise.
	
	
	The proposed ground asserts that his Honour erred in finding that the applicant knew the quantity of drugs which were to be purchased by Ibrahim, and in concluding that the applicant played a more significant role than his co-offender.
	
	
	The applicant’s task in making good that complaint is a difficult one.
	
	
	Firstly, as the applicant conceded in his written submissions to this Court, the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter very much for the sentencing judge. In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282, Spigelman CJ said, at [37]:
	


“Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.”


	
	Here, the sentencing judge had the significant advantage over this Court of having heard the applicant’s trial. His Honour heard evidence called from witnesses including the applicant and the co-offender (who was cross-examined by the Crown with leave pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)) and, of particular importance, the telephone intercepts that were played to the court at trial. His Honour was able to consider and assess the tone of voice and manner of speech used by the applicant and the co-offender during relevant calls, and it is apparent that those aspects of the evidence, opaque to this Court, significantly informed his Honour’s factual findings.
	
	
	In concluding that the applicant was aware of the quantity of drug to be collected by Ibrahim in Narwee, and in finding that the applicant’s role was greater than that of his co-offender, his Honour drew inferences from the whole of the evidence before him and from the presentation before him of the applicant and Ibrahim in evidence as witnesses.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the tone of authority and command used by the applicant in his telephone discussions with the co-offender, such as in the calls of 17 July 2013 when demanding that Ibrahim meet him immediately, and those of 18 July 2013, (“Oy, come to my house right now, bro”).
	
	
	The meeting of 17 July 2013 (of very brief duration) was held not at the home of either man but in a car, at a park. Having regard to all of the circumstances of the meeting, the sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was in control of the situation and the meeting was for the purpose of the applicant providing some or all of the funds to make the following day’s purchase of methylamphetamine. Provision of funds for the purchase was a feature his Honour was entitled to rely upon to infer a greater role for the applicant.
	
	
	After the drugs had been discarded on 18 July 2013 and thereafter hidden by the co-offender, the applicant referred to the discarded object in conversation with Ibrahim as “it” without need for explanation or clarification. He chastised Ibrahim that he had “fucked up” and reminded him that the “number one rule is to come straight home. Don’t go driving around man.”
	
	
	The applicant’s concern about using a different car to come to Narwee, his anxiety to retrieve the package without inquiry as to its contents or size, and his caution about the possibility of “getting done,” all bespeak knowledge of the contents of the package, and it was open to his Honour to so find. The actual finding, “that the offender understood the amount of drug Ibrahim was purchasing” (Judgment, p 6), was not precise as to quantity.
	
	
	That assessment was additionally informed by the evidence of the drug connected items – cash, digital scales, resealable plastic bags, likely tick lists - found at the applicant’s home by police the following month, and by the evidence of the false subscriber details of the mobile telephone used by the applicant.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence relied upon by the sentencing judge in reaching the factual findings he made, I consider that it was entirely open to his Honour to find that the applicant was aware of the quantity of the drug to be collected at Narwee, and that his role was greater than that of his co-offender, in that he supplied at least part of the purchase monies and was able to direct the co-offender.
	
	
	That conclusion is supported by the second feature which adds to the applicant’s task in persuading this Court otherwise, and that is the concession he appears to have made as to the facts during the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	During the proceedings on sentence of 20 March 2015, the Crown sought to tender a summary of the facts it contended had been established at trial. Referring to that summary, counsel for the applicant (not the counsel who appeared in this Court) said:
	


“I note that my friend has very helpfully prepared a summary of the facts in relation to the trial.” (AB 80; T2:11)


	
	It is apparent that the applicant through his counsel not only took no issue with the Crown’s statement of facts, but embraced the document as helpful.
	
	
	The statement of facts referred to the applicant using language of command when speaking with the applicant (pars [3] and [4] for example), and said explicitly that the package the co-offender was seen to put into his pants after meeting the applicant “contained a quantity of cash to be used for the purchase of prohibited drugs the following day” (at par [8]).
	
	
	Control of the funds used to purchase prohibited drugs is a feature indicative of both knowledge of what was being purchased (its nature and quantity) and of a superior role to that of Ibrahim.
	
	
	Having reached the conclusions he did as to these features of the facts, the sentencing judge referred to them and to the quantity and purity of the drugs, the planned nature of the offence, and its commercial nature, in determining that a sentence of 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years (special circumstances having been found) was required to adequately reflect the objective gravity of the applicant’s crime.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view, it was well open to his Honour to find the facts as he did, and to assess the objective gravity of the applicant’s offence having regard to the facts as he found them to be.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to make good the proposed ground of appeal.
	
	
	I would not grant leave to him to advance it.

								1.
								The indictment avers that the offence occurred between 17 July 2013 and 18 July 2013, a timeframe that does not exist. This appears to be an error. The Crown case was that the offence was committed over both of those dates, rather than between them. The point was not taken at trial, and nor was it raised by the parties before this Court. Nothing turns on the mis-statement as to date and, since time was not of the essence in proof of the offence, and the actual dates of the offence were clearly established on the evidence, the error does not vitiate the indictment or invalidate the conviction: see generally s 16(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW); R v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158; R v VHP (1997) 4 Crim LN 44; DPP (NSW) v Knight [2006] NSWSC 646; (2006) 162 A Crim R 555.

		21 June 2016",2016-06-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701476,Application by the Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 759,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	This is an application pursuant to s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) for forfeiture of sums of money held in bank accounts and on travel debit cards (the property) by a number of persons. The section in its entirety is as follows:
	


49 Forfeiture orders—property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.

(1) A court with *proceeds jurisdiction must make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:

(a) the *responsible authority for a *restraining order under section 19 that covers the property applies for an order under this subsection; and

(b) the restraining order has been in force for at least 6 months; and

(c) the court is satisfied that one or more of the following applies:

(i) the property is *proceeds of one or more *indictable offences;

(ii) the property is proceeds of one or more *foreign indictable offences;

(iii) the property is proceeds of one or more *indictable offences of Commonwealth concern;

(iv) the property is an instrument of one or more *serious offences; and

(e) the court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an *interest in the property.

(2) A finding of the court for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c):

(a) need not be based on a finding that a particular person committed any offence; and

(b) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence, and can be based on a finding that some offence or other of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(c) was committed.

(3) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the court is satisfied that:

(a) no application has been made under Division 3 of Part 2‑1 for the property to be excluded from the *restraining order; or

(b) any such application that has been made has been withdrawn.

Refusal to make a forfeiture order

(4) Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make an order under that subsection relating to property that the court is satisfied:

(a) is an *instrument of a *serious offence other than a *terrorism offence; and

(b) is not *proceeds of an offence;

if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.


	
	The matter came before me in the Duty List on 17 May 2016. On that occasion the solicitor for Ms Hala Zahab appeared, and sought a lengthy adjournment. Instead, I stood the matter over, part-heard before me, for two days until 19 May 2016, and delivered two short ex tempore judgments in support of doing so.
	
	
	On that latter occasion, the solicitor for Ms Zahab again appeared, and informed me that she did not oppose the making of the orders. Senior counsel for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the plaintiff) nevertheless submitted that it would be inappropriate for orders simply to be made with the consent of Ms Zahab without deeper consideration by me of their appropriateness, a proposition that I accepted. Very courteously, her solicitor obliged me by remaining in court so that he could offer any assistance that I required.
	


Background


	
	The background may be shortly stated.
	
	
	On 11 November 2015, Adams J made a restraining order over the accounts in question, pursuant to s 19 of the Act. That order was in turn founded on satisfaction that the property was an instrument of a serious offence, the offence relied upon being entering, or remaining in, a “declared zone” (the Al Raqqa province in Syria) pursuant to s 119.2 of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)(the Criminal Code); or a conspiracy to commit such an offence, contrary to s 11.1 of the Criminal Code.
	
	
	As I understand it, no person identified as a possible interested person in the sums of money has had any communication with the plaintiff or taken any forensic step since the making of that restraining order.
	
	
	The exception is Ms Zahab. On 18 November 2015, seemingly whilst unrepresented, she complied with a further order of Adams J that she provide a sworn statement setting out all of her assets and liabilities. Thereafter, she approached her current solicitors, including with regard to the application under consideration.
	


The evidence before me


	
	By way of a number of affidavits of a Federal officer, a substantial amount of documentary evidence was placed before me by the plaintiff. In a nutshell, it showed that a restraining order with regard to the property in question had been sought and granted on 11 November 2015; that various attempts have been made by the plaintiff to contact individuals who may be persons with an interest in the property; and that Ms Zahab has a general power of attorney over the affairs of one interested party, and separately is a signatory to two bank accounts that are included within the restrained property.
	


Submissions


	
	Senior counsel for the plaintiff took me through the structure of s 49 of the Act.
	
	
	First, he submitted that there is no question but that this Court is a court “with proceeds jurisdiction”, pursuant to s 335 of the Act.
	
	
	Secondly, he invited my attention to the use of the word “must” in the chapeau of s 49(1) of the Act, and submitted that Parliament has expressed an intention that, once certain preconditions are satisfied, the making of the order sought is either mandatory or very close to it.
	
	
	Thirdly, turning to s 49(1)(a), he submitted that, pursuant to s 338 of the Act, his client is a “responsible authority”, and it has undoubtedly applied for a restraining order.
	
	
	Fourthly, with regard to s 49(1)(b), he submitted that, as a matter of simple mathematics, the restraining order has indeed been in force for over six months.
	
	
	Fifthly, he submitted, for reasons that I shall come to in a moment, that s 49(1)(c) has no application, in light of the evidence placed before me.
	
	
	Sixthly, with regard to s 49(1)(e), he submitted that, for reasons that I shall discuss in more detail shortly, I would be satisfied that his client had taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons who may have an interest in the property.
	
	
	Seventhly, he submitted that, because s 49(2) is merely an elucidation of s 49(1)(c), it does not require satisfaction.
	
	
	Senior counsel then took me to s 49(3) of the Act. He submitted that no application that the property, or any portion of it, be excluded from the restraining order had been made by any person, including Ms Zahab. Accordingly, he submitted, s 49(3) is engaged, with the consequence that s 49(1)(c) and s 49(2) of the Act are of no moment.
	
	
	Eighthly and finally, he noted that s 49(4) provides me with a discretion not to make the orders sought, despite the use of the word “must” in the chapeau of s 49(1) to which he had invited attention. But focusing on the essential preconditions for the exercise of that discretion contained in s 49(4) of the Act, he submitted that, based on the evidence placed before me, I would not be satisfied of any of them, let alone all of them.
	
	
	Turning to the particular question of s 49(1)(e), and the need for me to be satisfied that his client had taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons who may have an interest in the property, he submitted that, in short, identification of them has readily been achieved, in that the account or card holders of the bank accounts and the travel cards are named in connection with them. He noted that the evidence placed before me shows that all of them left Australia some time ago, and that none of them have returned. He also submitted that his client had sent emails to all of the email addresses associated with those individuals that are able to be known to his client, including by way of addresses given by those individuals to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in passport request forms. Some of the emails sent by his client had “bounced”, but, with regard to each individual, at least one email address appeared to be open and operating.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that it is simply not practical for his client to undertake extensive investigations of the whereabouts of persons once they leave Australia, especially if they may well have entered a zone of armed conflict.
	
	
	Separately, he submitted that the legislation imposes a requirement that his client take “reasonable steps”, not (for example) “all possible steps” or that “no stone be left unturned”.
	
	
	Furthermore, he drew attention to s 74 of the Act, which, in summary, provides a regime whereby it is possible for persons who have in truth not had notice of an application for forfeiture to apply subsequently to have the forfeiture reversed. That facility, he submitted, can inform how one would interpret the meaning of the phrase “reasonable steps” in s 49(1)(e), bearing in mind that one must interpret that subparagraph in the context of the whole of the Act.
	
	
	Separately, although he submitted that, in light of the fact that no application for exclusion from the restraining order had ever been made by Ms Zahab, it was not strictly necessary, senior counsel engaged in an analysis of her position, as part of the obligation of his client as a model litigant and in order to assist my understanding of the position.
	
	
	As I have said, there is evidence to suggest that Ms Zahab has a power of attorney over some of the restrained property and has been made a signatory to two bank accounts. Senior counsel took me to the definition of interest contained in s 338 of the Act, which is as follows:
	


Interest, in relation to property or a thing, means:

(a) a legal or equitable estate or interest in the property or thing; or

(b) a right, power or privilege in connection with the property or thing;

whether present or future and whether vested or contingent.


	
	He submitted that it is quite true that Ms Zahab has a “power” in the sense that she has a power of attorney. He also submitted, as I understand it, that she has “a right… in connection with” some of the property, in that she is able to operate the bank accounts.
	
	
	But with regard to the former, he submitted that, in accordance with well-established principles about the rights and duties of a person conferred with a power of attorney, the power conferred upon Ms Zahab does not, in truth, provide her with “an interest”. All it provides her with is the duty to conduct the affairs of the principal in his or her interests.
	
	
	As for the signatory rights, he submitted that, without more, that could not be seen as an interest of Ms Zahab either. In other words, senior counsel submitted that unless there were some specific evidence that Ms Zahab is entitled to operate the accounts for her own benefit, I should not interpret the signatory rights as permitting her to do so.
	
	
	Furthermore, senior counsel invited attention to the statement of assets of Ms Zahab which was placed before me, and in which she makes no claim that either the property over which she holds a power of attorney or the bank accounts to which she is a signatory is an asset of hers.
	
	
	In short, senior counsel submitted that, due to the structure of the statute, any question of an interest of Ms Zahab does not require my consideration. Nevertheless, if I did proceed to consider it, I would come to the view that neither her power of attorney nor her signatory rights should be regarded as an interest for the purposes of the Act.
	
	
	Finally, senior counsel for the plaintiff made it clear that, in the circumstances that I have outlined, there was no application for costs against Ms Zahab.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the submissions of senior counsel for the plaintiff on that topic, the solicitor for the defendant explicitly confirmed that he had reflected upon those two possible “interests” of his client, and wished to make no submission about them standing in the way of the making of the orders sought.
	


Determination


	
	Turning to my determination, I accept the submissions of senior counsel for the plaintiff about the structure of the Act. Examination of previous judgments of this Court shows that those submissions are uncontroversial: see Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1171; Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Krstic [2016] NSWSC 510; and Application by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police re Matter 2012/249599 [2013] NSWSC 1444.
	
	
	Secondly, I accept on all the evidence placed before me that the plaintiff has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify individuals who are or may be interested persons, and accordingly the requirement contained in s 49(1)(e) is made out. I accept the proposition that Parliament has not imposed an unduly onerous obligation upon the plaintiff pursuant to that subparagraph, when read in light of the Act in general, and in light of s 74 in particular.
	
	
	Thirdly, there is no question of me exercising any discretion not to make the order pursuant to s 49(4) of the Act, for the simple reason that, on the evidence placed before me, I can be satisfied of none of the essential preconditions contained in that subsection.
	
	
	Fourthly, although it is not necessary to come to a firm view about it due to the statutory structure, I am prepared to accept (without having heard from a contradictor) that a power of attorney, unless of an unusual or exceptional nature, does not provide the recipient with an interest, as one would generally understand that concept pursuant to the definition in s 338 of the Act.
	
	
	Whether a person who is able to operate a bank account has such an interest is, to my mind, more open to debate, especially when, as here, there is no evidence as to whether or not there was any restriction placed by the conferrer upon that operation. But in light of the fact that no application for exclusion of any part of the property has been made by any person, including by Ms Zahab; and in light of the express disavowal by her solicitor of any reliance upon those signing rights in opposition to the making of the order; I do not believe that that possible controversy requires resolution by me.
	
	
	In summary, then, I accept the submission of senior counsel that all of the essential preconditions for the making of an order have been established, and that there is no basis for me exercising my discretion not to make such an order. It follows that the mandatory force of the chapeau of s 49(1) is indeed engaged.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), the property listed in Sch 1 to the summons filed 11 November 2015 be forfeited to the Commonwealth.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), the property listed in Sch 2 to the summons filed 11 November 2015 be forfeited to the Commonwealth.

		15 June 2016",2016-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701480,Turnbull v R [2016] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: On 19 April 2016 the Court heard an application by Ian Robert Turnbull (""the applicant"") for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of what he asserted was an interlocutory judgment of Johnson J delivered on 15 April 2016: R v Turnbull (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 439 (""the judgment""). At the time of the hearing the applicant's trial was scheduled to commence with a jury on Thursday 21 April 2016.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing the Court refused leave to appeal and indicated that reasons would be published at a later time. The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.
	


The prosecution


	
	The applicant was to stand trial upon an indictment containing two counts: one alleging that he murdered Mr Glendon Turner and the other that he detained Mr Robert Strange without consent with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely the killing of Mr Turner. Mr Turner was a Compliance and Regulation Officer for the Office of Environment and Heritage and his duties included enforcing the law under the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW). The applicant, a farmer and land owner, had been prosecuted in respect of illegal land clearing offences in the Moree district. The Crown contended that there was animosity between the two. On 29 July 2014 Mr Turner and Mr Strange were performing their duties. The applicant was made aware of their presence in the district. The Crown alleges that he attended their location where he shot and killed Mr Turner.
	


The defence


	
	The applicant gave notice pursuant to s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that his proposed defences to the charge of murder were (a) substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and (b) extreme provocation under s 23 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	Section 23 of the Crimes Act was amended as of 13 June 2014 so as to replace the partial defence of provocation with a new, and comparatively more limited, partial defence of extreme provocation. In either case it is a ""partial"" defence in the sense that liability for murder is reduced to liability for manslaughter. This case is the first in which it has been sought to be raised.
	
	
	There are four elements of the partial defence set out in s 23(2). The principal one in the proceedings is that the act of the accused was done in response to ""conduct of the deceased [that] was a serious indictable offence"": s 23(2)(b). The serious indictable offence the applicant alleged was committed by the deceased was intimidation or harassment under s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).
	
	
	Another element of the partial defence is that ""the act of the accused that causes death was in response to conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused"": s 23(2)(a).
	
	
	Another element is that ""the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased"": s 23(2)(d).
	


The judgment


	
	Johnson J explained the need and purpose of his judgment of 15 April 2016 (R v Turnbull (No 5)) as follows:
	


""[6] In advance of the trial, a number of pretrial issues were raised. After the Court had ruled upon issues arising with respect to subpoenas issued on behalf of the Accused, the Crown submitted that a pretrial hearing should proceed with respect to the Accused's intended reliance upon extreme provocation and the tendency notice served by the Accused in connection with that issue.

[7] After hearing submissions, I ruled on 11 April 2016 that certain issues were appropriate for pretrial rulings: R v Turnbull (No. 4) (unreported, 11 April 2016). I observe that the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 came into existence on 13 June 2014. The provision only applies to events occurring after that date. The present trial appears to be the first case in which the proper construction and application of s.23 falls for consideration.

[8] Further, as will be seen, the context in which extreme provocation is sought to be raised in this case is highly unusual. I formed the view that a combination of factors rendered this matter appropriate for a pretrial hearing for the purpose of ss.130 and 139 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s.192A Evidence Act 1995.

[9] The matters to be addressed in this judgment arising from the pretrial hearing are as follows:

(a)   ruling on a question of law that might arise at the trial, being the proper construction of s.23 Crimes Act 1900: s.139(3)(g) Criminal Procedure Act 1986;

(b)   ruling concerning the admissibility or use of tendency evidence proposed to be adduced by the Accused: s.139(3)(e); s.192A Evidence Act 1995;

(c)   arising from the ruling concerning the proper construction of s.23, a ruling concerning the possible operation of s.23 in the context of this trial upon the Court's present state of knowledge of the matter.

[10] At one point, the Crown submitted that the Court would be in a position to, in effect, make a final ruling that the partial defence of extreme provocation was not available to the Accused in the circumstances of this case. The Accused has elected not to place before the Court, at this pretrial hearing, the entirety of factual matters which may bear upon this topic. The Court has a considerable body of material provided by the Crown (and referred to by the Accused), to which reference will be made. I will proceed to consider known aspects of the case, including material which the Accused has put before the Court on the tendency issue, for the purpose of this judgment.

[11] I am conscious that caution must be exercised in taking a step in advance of the trial which would operate to reduce, or even remove, the basis upon which an accused person may seek to rely upon a partial defence such as extreme provocation: Lindsay v The Queen [2015] HCA 16; 89 ALJR 518 at 526 [27]-[28]. I am satisfied, however, that in circumstances where a new statutory provocation provision is being considered for the first time, and where the context in which it is said to arise is most unusual, that the course which I am taking is both open to the Court and appropriate."" (Emphasis added)


	
	The emphasised portions of the above extract are the first indication that his Honour's approach in relation to the issue concerning s 23 was somewhat indicative in that his determination was made without a complete appreciation of all of the evidence that may bear upon the issue.
	
	
	His Honour's judgment then proceeded to review the relevant statutory provisions (s 23 of the Crimes Act and a number of sections of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act) (at [12]-[16]). He summarised ""factual matters"" including ""evidence of contact between the [applicant] and Mr Turner"" (at [17]-[54]). Next, his Honour discussed the new partial defence of ""extreme provocation"" with substantial reference to the Attorney General's second reading speech (at [55]-[66]).
	
	
	The judgment then turned to a consideration of the submissions made by the parties as to the construction and operation of s 23 of the Crimes Act (judgment at [67]-[73]). The Crown's position was that the conduct relied upon by the applicant was conduct of the deceased in fulfilling his role in enforcing the law under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The applicant's position was that there is nothing in s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act that required as an element of the offence therein that the person was acting without lawful power or authority. (The submissions are more fully summarised in his Honour's judgment.) His Honour ruled, in effect, in favour of the Crown (judgment at [74]-[88]).
	
	
	His Honour's judgment mentioned at an early stage (at [10]-[11] - see above) that his ruling was made on the basis of material that was available to him at the pre-trial stage. Not all of that which might be relied upon by the applicant was known to him. His Honour's reasoning as to his conclusion was couched in terms which confirmed that he was adjudicating upon the issue on the basis of what might not be the full gamut of material relevant to the issue. The following statements extracted from his Honour's reasoning are further indicative of this:
	


""[74] … The material before the Court at this pretrial hearing … indicates …""

""[80] Looking at the factual material as presently identified at this pretrial hearing, …""

""[85] It must be observed, however, that the material before the Court at this pretrial hearing does not …""


	
	On the construction of s 13 of the Crimes (Personal and Domestic Violence) Act, his Honour concluded:
	


""[76] I accept that a s 13 offence is not confined to conduct in a domestic setting. However, where the conduct sought to be relied upon as a s 13 offence is that of a public officer exercising compliance or enforcement functions, I consider that conduct is only capable of constituting a s 13 offence if it falls completely outside the exercise of the public officer's functions. By that I mean that the conduct in question must be detached entirely from the officer's employment functions.""


	
	At the hearing of the application, Mr Alexis SC for the applicant was pressed as to whether this should be construed as his Honour referring to the lawful exercise of the public officer's functions. In other words, if the officer was acting beyond the bounds of his or her lawful functions, it is possible that a s 13 offence could be committed. Mr Alexis resisted this interpretation but I believe it is the only sensible way to read it.
	
	
	His Honour's conclusion is encapsulated in the following:
	


""[87] Having regard to all the material to which I have made reference, I am not persuaded that this material constitutes evidence that the conduct of Mr Turner was a serious indictable offence (a s 13 offence) for the purpose of s 23(2)(b) of the Act.""


	
	The judgment continued with his Honour expressing some ""views"" in respect of other aspects of the construction of s 23 ([89]-[99]). Those ""views"" included that ""conduct towards or affecting the accused"" in s 23(2)(a) requires conduct directed personally as between the deceased and the accused and excluded conduct towards other persons (such as the accused's relatives) that may affect the accused. They also included that the ""ordinary person"" test in s 23(2)(d) is a purely objective test.
	
	
	His Honour then dealt with the tendency issue (at [100]-[116]) which is of no present moment.
	
	
	The judgment concludes as follows:
	


""[117] The conclusions which I have reached in this judgment are that:

(a)   the conduct of Mr Turner relied upon by the Accused and as identified in this judgment is not capable of constituting a serious indictable offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900;

(b)   the application of the Accused to rely upon tendency evidence is declined.

[118] As there is a possibility (perhaps theoretical) that the Accused will adduce evidence which is capable of raising the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 within the confines of this judgment, I cannot determine finally that such a partial defence should not be left to the jury. That said, I have had regard to all material before the Court at this pretrial hearing and, upon the construction of s.23 which I have adopted, it may be difficult to conceive a basis upon which this partial defence could be left to the jury.""


	
	The concluding paragraph is the final indication in the judgment that his Honour's conclusion was tentative because it was based upon a potentially incomplete knowledge of all the evidence that might be tendered or adduced at the trial that might be relevant to the s 23 issue.
	


The application for leave to appeal


	
	The proposed grounds of appeal as set out in the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal Against Interlocutory Judgment of Order may be summarised:
	


1.   His Honour erred in determining that the conduct of the deceased relied upon by the applicant was not capable of constituting a serious indictable offence under s 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act.

2.   His Honour erred in holding that ""conduct towards or affecting the accused"" in s 23(2)(a) requires conduct directed personally by the deceased towards the accused.

3.   His Honour erred in holding that the ""ordinary person"" test in s 23(2)(d) is a purely objective test.

Competency of the proposed appeal


	
	It was indicated to the parties that the Court wished to hear first on the question of whether the impugned rulings of Johnson J were interlocutory judgments (or orders) that were amenable to an appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Notwithstanding the efficiency with which the Registrar was able to arrange for the matter to come before the Court, the parties provided detailed written submissions in advance of the hearing that were supplemented by their oral submissions.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to review the submissions in any detail. In short, Mr Alexis SC, on behalf of the applicant, sought to portray the rulings as having a sufficient degree of finality in respect of the subjects with which they dealt to be interlocutory judgments or orders befitting an appeal of this type.
	
	
	In the end I find that I cannot distinguish the situation in this case to that which pertained in A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R [2015] NSWCCA 244. That case concerned an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) against a pre-trial ruling, coincidentally by Johnson J, as to the meaning of the word ""mutilates"" in the context of an offence of female genital mutilation in s 45 of the Crimes Act. With the concurrence of Beazley P and Bellew J I wrote at some length on the subject of whether this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal (at [16]-[27]). The following points relevant to the present case are derived from that writing. (I will not attribute quotations or repeat the citations of authority; they are evident in the source.)
	


The existence of an ""interlocutory judgment or order"" is essential for review under s 5F(3).

A judgment determines the proceedings, or at least an identifiable part of them, and being capable of entry in the records of the Court. An order amounts to a command that something be done or not done.

There is no bright line test for discriminating between judgments or orders, on the one hand, and rulings which do not constitute judgments or orders, on the other.

Commonwealth v Mullane (1961) 106 CLR 166 provides an example of a ruling on a point of law which was raised. It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed. The primary judge might have altered his mind; he might have ruled otherwise; he might have qualified his ruling; there was no determination.

It is necessary to have regard to substance rather than form. It is the character of the question and the effect of the decision, that makes the difference.

The fact that the judgment in question might include a detailed assessment of evidence and submissions and the reasons might be lengthy. That is an irrelevant consideration.

The legal issue dealt with in the judgment might be ""unique"" and not the subject of any binding authority. That is not relevant, let alone determinative.

The rule might be characterised as ""categorical"" and it might be ""of extreme importance to the trial"". Again, that for present purposes is not a relevant matter.

The fact that rulings may affect the outcome does not provide a sufficient basis for permitting an interlocutory appeal. If an appeal was available in such circumstances, many rulings on evidence and disputed directions to the jury would become the potential subject of an interlocutory appeal.


	
	Three examples of pre-trial determinations of legal issues that were held not to be interlocutory judgments or orders for the purposes of an appeal pursuant to s 5F were cited in A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R. In W O v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 275 the ruling was concerned with whether an offence of attempting to have sexual intercourse without consent was an offence of specific intent which would impact upon the relevance of the accused's intoxication at the relevant time. The judge also ruled upon whether s 61HA of the Crimes Act applied. It was held (at [30]) that these ""should be characterised as a preliminary determination of certain questions of law which were anticipated as likely to arise in the course of the proceedings"". They were held not to be interlocutory judgments or orders.
	
	
	R v Adamson [2005] NSWCCA 7 was also concerned with an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F against a pre-trial ruling that a particular offence was not one of specific intent for the purpose of the intoxication provisions in Pt 11A of the Crimes Act. It was held by Spigelman CJ (at [7]) that this was not an interlocutory judgment or order: ""It does not have the requisite element of finality in terms of resolving an issue in the proceedings in a binding manner"".
	
	
	R v Piper [2005] NSWCCA 134 was concerned with a ruling on the admissibility of evidence in relation to a proposed defence of mental illness. It was an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F(2) but still turned on whether the ruling was an interlocutory judgment or order. It was held (at [11]) that it did not.
	
	
	In A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R, the pre-trial ruling of the trial judge bore upon how he would direct the jury as to the elements of the offence. It involved a question of statutory construction of a word in the offence-making provision. In the present case the pre-trial ruling bore upon whether a partial defence could be left to the jury. It, too, involves a question of statutory construction of aspects of the defence-making provision. I see little to distinguish between the two.
	
	
	In A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R, senior counsel for two of the applicants conceded in response to questioning from the bench that it was open to the trial judge to modify the direction he had indicated he would give to the jury. Notwithstanding this was suggested as being only a hypothetical possibility, the very existence of such a possibility was a concession that the ruling lacked the finality necessary for the ruling to be regarded as an interlocutory judgment or order amenable to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3).
	
	
	The same applies in the present case. The judge gave a ruling on a statutory construction question in the context of his appreciation of the evidence that was perceived to be less than complete. Indeed, the defence had held back from disclosing all that it might tender or adduce at trial. As was his right, and as Mr Alexis pointed out at the hearing, the applicant wished to maintain his right to silence by not disclosing the evidence which he proposed to tender or adduce and the material before his Honour was only that provided by the Crown.
	
	
	The ramification of this was that when his Honour indicated that to constitute an offence under s 13 of the Crimes (Personal and Domestic Violence) Act there would need to be evidence of conduct outside the exercise of the deceased's legitimate employment function, his Honour was speaking in the context only of prosecution evidence; being oblivious to any evidence to the contrary. His Honour was not excluding that the partial defence could be relied upon if there was such contrary evidence. His Honour specifically allowed for that possibility at the conclusion of his judgment (at [118] - see above).
	
	
	Mr Alexis pointed to the provision in s 139(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides that a pre-trial ruling is binding on the judge presiding at trial unless that judge determines that it would not be in the interests of justice. The ""interests of justice"" proviso to that provision is a clear indication that a pre-trial ruling, such as was made by Johnson J in the present case, is not final.
	
	
	However, Mr Alexis sought to counter this by saying that it was not expected that there would be any evidence in the trial that the deceased was conducting himself outside the realm of his employment function. Accordingly, his Honour's determination was purely a matter of statutory construction that would abide notwithstanding whatever further evidence the applicant may tender or adduce at the trial. In this way he sought to distinguish the present case from the three examples I have mentioned above, W O v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), R v Adamson and R v Piper. With respect, I do not see the distinction.
	
	
	As in the case of A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R, senior counsel for the applicant conceded that if, hypothetically, prior to or during the applicant's trial another court at the same or at a higher level in the judicial hierarchy made a determination in relation to the offence in s 13 of the Crimes (Personal and Domestic Violence) Act being committed by a person carrying out an employment function that was contrary to Johnson J's determination, it was possible for him to argue that it was in the interests of justice for his Honour to revisit the issue and revise his decision. As in A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R, I see this as an illustration of the lack of finality of the determination rendering it inapt to characterise it as an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F(3).
	
	
	The ""views"" expressed by his Honour regarding s 23(2)(a) and (d) could even less be characterised as an ""interlocutory judgment or order"". For the defence to be left to the jury, his Honour said that there had to be evidence of each of the 4 elements. He indicated that there was no evidence (of which he was then aware) raising the matter in s 23(2)(b). As a result, it was unnecessary for his Honour to formally rule on whether the elements in s 23(2)(a) or (d) could be made out. However (it would seem in deference to the submissions that had been made) he indicated what he specifically referred to as his ""views"". At best, they could only be regarded as an indication based upon an incomplete evidentiary basis of what his Honour thought those provisions entailed. They can hardly be regarded as something that was a definitive judgment or order that finally disposed of some aspect of the proceedings.
	


Conclusion


	
	The application for leave to appeal failed on the basis that it was incompetent. The proposed appeal did not concern an interlocutory judgment or order that was open to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	The foregoing are my reasons for joining in the Court's order that leave to appeal be refused.
	
	
	GARLING J: On 19 April 2016, I joined in with the orders which the Court pronounced that day. I did so because I was satisfied that there was no competent basis for the Court to grant leave to the applicant to appeal to the Court pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This is clearly demonstrated in the reasons of R A Hulme J with which I agree.
	
	
	WILSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2701482,Soyke v R [2016] NSWCCA 112,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J, and with her reasons.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: The applicant pleaded guilty to four computer related offences under s 477 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Another 17 offences of attempt to cause unauthorised access to restricted data under ss 478.1(1) and 11.1(1) of the Code, which each carried maximum penalties of 2 years imprisonment, were also taken into account on sentence, in accordance with s 16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
	
	
	On 15 October 2015, Culver DCJ sentenced the applicant to 3 years imprisonment. He is due to be released on 14 October 2016 on recognisance to be of good behaviour of $5,000.
	
	
	The individual offences to which the appellant entered his pleas were:
	



	
	Sequence 1: Cause unauthorised modification of computer data, contrary to s 477.2(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth); imprisonment for 18 months to commence on the date of sentence (15 October 2015), expiring on 14 April 2017.
	
	
	Sequence 3: Attempt cause unauthorised modification of data contrary to s 477.2(1) and 11.1(1); imprisonment for 12 months to commence on the date of sentence (15 October 2015) expiring 14 October 2016.
	
	
	Sequence 6: Unauthorised access to data with intent to commit serious indictable offence, contrary to s 477.1(1)(a)(i); imprisonment for 2.5 years, to commence on 15 April 2016 expiring on 14 October 2016.
	
	
	Sequence 7: Unauthorised access to data with intent to commit serious offence, contrary to s 477.1(1)(a)(i); imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 15 August 2016, expiring on 14 February 2018.
	



	
	Initially the applicant sought leave to pursue two grounds of appeal:
	


“1.   Her Honour erred in the assessment of the seriousness of the offences.

2.   The sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the Applicant’s case.”


	
	By motion later filed the applicant sought an order under Rule 25A of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), so that he could pursue a third ground of appeal:
	


“3.   The sentencing exercise miscarried in the absence of evidence of the Applicant’s mental state, namely that he had developed an addiction present at the time of committing the offences.”


	
	That leave was sought in order that the applicant could pursue an application for leave to rely on a report of 8 October 2015 of Dr Butler, a consultant paediatrician, which had not been relied on at the sentencing hearing on 15 October, as well as a 4 May 2016 report from the psychologist Ms Robilliard, who had only interviewed the applicant on 21 March 2016.
	
	
	The leave sought was opposed by the Crown. In issue is whether either report is admissible. The resolution of what lies in issue requires consideration to be given to the contents of the reports and the oral evidence given by Ms Robilliard, as well as the affidavit evidence of the applicant’s solicitor.
	


The reports are not admissible

The applicable principles


	
	There is no issue that had the two reports been tendered at the sentencing hearing, they would have been admissible, going as they do to the applicant’s mental health. Dr Butler’s report was then available, but Ms Robilliard's was not. Admissibility of the reports on appeal against sentence depends on their nature.
	
	
	In Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; (2011) 209 A Crim R 509 the applicable principles were discussed at [104] - [110]. The general principle is that “parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence” (at [104]). In criminal cases the rigour with which that rule is applied “must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice” (at [105]). There the competing considerations were identified to be:
	


“(1)    that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance;

(2)    that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied.”


	
	There are also, however, recognised limits on when the Court may legitimately accept additional evidence on sentencing. They depend on whether the evidence is ""fresh"" evidence, or ""new"" evidence. The distinction between the two was identified at [107] to be:
	


“107       ""Fresh"" evidence has been defined by Mason J (as he then was) in Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659 at p 675 as:

""... evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and ... evidence which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence.""

""New"" evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that does not qualify as ""fresh"", either because it was available, but not used, at first instance, or because, in the exercise of reasonable diligence it could have been obtained. The distinction is important in the present case.”


	
	New evidence is not admissible. Even fresh evidence may not be admitted if it is concluded that it would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance (at [108]). If fresh evidence is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless.
	
	
	Further, as discussed in Khoury v R (at 110), because of the provisions of subs-s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), on which the Court’s jurisdiction on a sentence appeal depends:
	


“evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government.”


	
	In this case the application to lead additional evidence arises in circumstances where any psychological conditions which the applicant suffers existed at sentencing and so the evidence is not precluded by s 6(3). The nature of the evidence sought to be led must, however, be properly identified.
	
	
	One of the reports was prepared before sentence and the other afterwards, accordingly one contains the opinions Dr Butler held at the time of sentence and the other the opinions Ms Robilliard formed subsequently. In Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1, Basten JA observed at [45] and [50]:
	


""45    Whether the relevant ‘event or circumstance' is the psychological condition, or the diagnosis, is one of the matters which has not been definitively resolved. There are fine distinctions to be drawn, in a practical way, between susceptibility to and suffering from a particular condition, different degrees of a known condition and the development of a syndrome (such as AIDS) from an infection (with HIV).

...

50   Because such material was not before the sentencing judge, it cannot provide a basis for identifying error on his Honour's part, at least in the ordinary meaning of that term. It may be that ‘error’ is established in a technical sense in that, for reasons with which his Honour was not familiar, the applicant did not have a ‘fair sentencing hearing’ because a particular matter was not exposed. This would appear to be a somewhat artificial approach to what must be treated, in substance, as an appeal by way of rehearing. To support such an appeal, one would expect to find an express power permitting a court to admit either fresh, or further, evidence: cf, Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 75A. Absent such a power, it is usual to characterise the appeal as an appeal ‘in the strict sense’, namely a determination of whether the primary judge erred in applying the law in force at the time of judgment, to the materials before the Court at that time: Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd and Meakes v Dignan [1931] HCA 34; 46 CLR 73 at 109. There is no provision equivalent to s 75A in the Criminal Appeal Act, nor in the Criminal Appeal Rules. In the absence of such a provision, the Court is presumably required to make up its own conditions respecting the admission and use of such material. Although it has been accepted that events occurring subsequent to sentence cannot form the basis of further evidence before this Court - see R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177 at 178D (Street CJ, Moffitt P and Lee J agreeing) - there is a fine line between a psychiatric condition which existed at the relevant time and a diagnosis which occurred subsequently.""


	
	In Khoury, Simpson J considered (at [120] – [121]):
	


“120   For myself, I would question the too ready acceptance that a psychological report post dating sentencing, is, because it is prepared after sentencing, fresh or new evidence. The substance of the evidence is not the existence of the report, but the history and opinions expressed in the report concerning the applicant's psychological condition. That may or may not be something of which the offender was (or his legal representative were) aware at the time of sentencing, but it is almost certainly evidence that, in the ordinary course, could with reasonable diligence have been obtained prior to sentencing.

121   That the evidence may cast light on circumstances known, but not fully appreciated, at sentencing, does not dictate that it will be admitted. The judgment remains a discretionary one. It is proper for the Court examine the circumstances of, and any explanation for, the non-production of the evidence - a deliberate decision on the part either of the applicant, or his or her legal representatives, ignorance in the applicant of the significance of the evidence, resulting in its not being communicated to the legal representatives, incompetent legal representation. At the outer limits, the cases also include those in which post sentencing circumstances are taken into account as relevant to known pre-sentencing circumstances (for example, Springer ). Also relevant will be the potential significance of the evidence to have affected the outcome at first instance (for example, Ashton).”

The reports


	
	The applicant was aged 18 when he committed these offences between November 2013 and May 2014, having been born in November 1995.
	
	
	Dr Butler’s one page October 2015 report disclosed that he had treated the applicant for ADHD from June 2000, when he was aged 4 years, to January 2012, when he was aged 16. When Dr Butler last treated him in 2012, the applicant’s symptoms of impulsivity, aggression and hyperactivity were being treated with medication, without which he became irritable and picked on his siblings and other people. In February 2011 he had also been diagnosed to be suffering a mood disorder, for which a mood stabiliser was prescribed without which he became overly aggressive over confident and not caring about himself or what he was doing. Dr Butler said that his mania was characterised by a distorted perception of reality and a feeling that he was always right and at times invincible. The prescribed medication improved these behaviours.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard saw the applicant when he was aged 20 years. Her May 2016 report indicated that his presentation was consistent with ADHD. He reported having received no treatment since he stopped seeing Dr Butler; that he was taking no medication; and that he was binge drinking when he had sufficient money, as well as smoking cannabis regularly, on occasions daily, as well as MDMA on weekends. He also reported spending 16 to 18 hours per day, including all night, using computers at the time of the offending, about 2 hours of which were devoted to his computer course and the balance looking for hacking opportunities and talking to other hackers. He also described the cyber community in which he was involved, as well as his co-offender. He also reported continuing his level of computer use after being charged with these offences, but then confining his activities to playing online games, particularly “War Game”. He was a “clan leader” for that game because of his skill and experience in that game and was able to recruit people through the cyber system and then to help them as an advisor/mentor.
	
	
	The explanation the applicant gave Ms Robilliard for his offending, committed after conviction for other such offences, was that it was fun at the time and that the urge to re-join his hacker community and his friends, had overwhelmed his self control.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard administered a “Clinical Assessment of Internet Addicted Clients” which suggested that the applicant suffered moderate internet addiction, which she clarified in cross-examination to be “internet gaming disorder”. She considered that his addiction could have been higher at the time of arrest. She also confirmed a now adult ADHD diagnosis. She considered that the urge to engage in his addictive behaviour had been overwhelming and irrational; that the rewards were access to his cyber community and the sense of kudos and social recognition which his ability to hack into data bases gave him, the admiration of others being highly rewarding to someone whose self-image and self-esteem were poor. She also considered that his ADHD facilitated his internet addiction; predisposed him to engaging in reckless impulsive activity; and limited his capacity to limit his behavioural responses.
	
	
	In her cross-examination, Ms Robilliard explained that internet addiction was the first behavioural addiction to be included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria guide used by health care professionals and that there were, as yet, but proposed criteria, which were being hotly debated. Those criteria were not in evidence.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard also explained that while the diagnosis was clinically useful, it was difficult to distinguish between what was compulsive and what was a passionate interest. Her view was that there was a continuum and that the argument about the criteria was around finding a definitive diagnostic point. The diagnosis of “internet gaming disorder” was thus something which required further study.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard agreed that in the applicant’s case he had told her that after he was charged with these offences, he had confined himself to playing online games, which permitted him to communicate with a cyber-community formed around such games and that gave him status and provided him with a reward contingency, which he did not have in real life.
	
	
	Mr Robilliard also said it was the number of hours per day, more than 16, and the resulting disruption to his day and night patterns, which were indicative of addiction. She considered that disruption to be dangerous for mood disorders. In re-examination she also said that it was his online activities generally, which started his addiction and that he had described stopping illegal hacking and focussing on playing the war game after arrest.
	


Dr Butler’s report is not admissible


	
	Dr Butler’s report is not admissible because it is new evidence. It was available, but not used, on sentence. There is no evidence that the applicant was unaware of it. On the evidence, even if he was, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been obtained.
	
	
	There is also no suggestion that the applicant was unaware of his diagnosis of ADHD, or his past treatment for that condition, even though no reference was made to it in the agreed facts. The case advanced in written submissions on sentence also made no reference to his psychological condition. Nor was it referred to in the presentence report in evidence, prepared after interview with the applicant and his parents, or in any of the other evidence tendered. There was no explanation given as to why this issue was not raised on sentence. The applicant did not give evidence on sentence or on appeal.
	
	
	In his 12 May affidavit the applicant’s solicitor deposed that he had spoken to the applicant’s mother, who had informed him that it was she who had obtained the report from Dr Butler and that she believed that she had provided it to the solicitor who represented the applicant on sentence, on the day of the hearing. He had also spoken to that solicitor, who had advised him that she had not previously seen that report. He had reviewed the Legal Aid file and there was no copy of the report on that file. Neither the solicitor nor the applicant’s mother swore an affidavit or were called to give oral evidence on appeal.
	
	
	It was not the applicant’s case that there had been representative error on sentence. The case advanced on sentence turned on the applicant’s motivation for his offending, which was said not to have been malice or to cause damage such as data deletion, or reputational or financial harm, but rather wanting attention.
	
	
	The proper inference from the evidence is that Dr Butler’s report cannot have been provided to the solicitor on the day of the sentence hearing, nor can she have been told about it, or the applicant’s prior diagnosis and treatment for ADHD, either then or previously. Had she been provided with such information, or even if the applicant or his parents had disclosed it to those who had prepared the presentence report, its relevance on sentencing would have been apparent.
	
	
	Dr Butler’s report is thus not admissible on appeal, given that it was available at the time of sentence and even if its existence was not then known to the applicant, or his solicitor, it could undoubtedly have been obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
	


Ms Robilliard’s report is also not admissible


	
	The position in relation to Ms Robilliard’s report is somewhat different, but it cannot be concluded that it is fresh evidence and so admissible. Despite the submission that absent this report, the Court had no information which would enable it to assess the applicant’s motive and the objective seriousness of his further offending, so soon after he was sentenced for similar offences in the Children’s Court, in circumstances where it is now known that he was acting under an irrational and compulsive addiction, the report is not admissible.
	
	
	That is because while the report did not exist at the time of sentence and the applicant was not aware that Ms Robilliard’s examination of him would result in the identification of a new condition, internet gaming disorder, which he had not previously been diagnosed to be suffering, it must also be concluded that reasonable diligence could have resulted in such a report being obtained for sentence.
	
	
	There was no evidence that suggested that there was any impediment to the applicant obtaining an up to date report as to his psychological condition prior to sentence. ADHD is a condition which can, but does not necessarily, persist into adulthood. At the time of his offending he was not pursuing any treatment for that condition. Dr Butler had not treated the applicant since 2012. What he had to say in 2015 could shed limited light on the applicant’s psychological condition at the time he committed these offences in 2013 and 2014.
	
	
	Once a report was sought from Ms Robilliard, she not only identified that the applicant’s ADHD had persisted into adulthood, but also that he was suffering from a previously unidentified addiction. That diagnosis is, however, as she explained in cross-examination, debatable.
	
	
	Even if that be overlooked, it is difficult to see how that diagnosis could explain the applicant’s offending behaviour, or that it could have had much impact on his sentence, if then relied on.
	
	
	In the account which he gave to the author of the presentence report, the applicant said that he was pursuing a Diploma of Information Technology and justified his actions by claiming to be of the belief that the commission of his offences provided a level of appeal to prospective employers in the IT industry, through showcasing his ability. He later told Dr Robilliard that he had pursued his offending because it was fun and the urge to rejoin his hacker community had overwhelmed his self restraint.
	
	
	That evidence is consistent with the applicant’s offending not being the result of an internet gaming addiction, even if he has such an addiction. Such an addiction would help explain the applicant’s pattern of excessive internet use, but not his illegal hacking activities. On his account to Ms Robilliard, the applicant’s internet use continued after he was charged, for similar lengths of time and over similar times of the day, but he was able to limit his internet activities to legal ones.
	
	
	That is not consistent with his criminal hacking being explained by his compulsive internet use. Had such illegal activities formed part of the diagnostic criteria for internet gaming addiction, no doubt that would have been explained.
	
	
	In the result, it is difficult to see how this debatable diagnosis could have affected the outcome of the proceedings, to the applicant’s advantage. While Ms Robilliard’s report would shed light on his subjective circumstances and questions of rehabilitation and risks of reoffending, it is difficult to see that the existence of an internet gaming addiction could have led to favourable conclusions as to his sentence.
	
	
	In those circumstances it cannot be concluded that the report is admissible as fresh evidence and accordingly, the leave sought in the motion must be refused.
	


Ground 1 – the seriousness of the offences


	
	The agreed facts were lengthy and complex; a chart setting out the details of the offences, prepared by the applicant’s solicitor advocate, was attached to the sentencing judgment. In summary, the applicant came to police attention after unauthorised access by an unknown person, using an identified moniker, to the system of an internet service provider, Netspeed Communications. The applicant was identified as having used Vodafone Telecommunication Services held in both his own and his mother’s name to gain that access. He pursued a variety of steps which it is unnecessary to describe, to hide his own Internal Protocol address, but used his laptop to access his personal email and Facebook accounts, where traces of these measures were left behind. The applicant also associated with identified persons online, Australian and Danish nationals, in the pursuit of his offending.
	
	
	Charges 1 and 3 concerned the applicant’s unauthorised intrusion into Netspeed’s systems. Charge 1 involved uploading an exploit file to a directory and making it publically viewable. This provided access to privileges normally reserved for trusted system administrators. The result was that the security of a website was altered, the uploaded file enabling files to be read, modified and deleted, user accounts and passwords to be obtained, programs to be downloaded and other steps to be taken, which would impair the security of the server.
	
	
	Charge 2 involved the uploading of an exploit file which also provided the applicant with access reserved for system and website administrators, impairing the system’s security system.
	
	
	Charge 3 involved the compilation and execution of exploit files which gave the applicant administrator privileges to the entire Netspeed VM, a program hosting 129 separate websites. Commands involving the downloading of files were entered and executed, but failed to run. There were also attempts to obtain further control, which would have given unrestricted access to the system and permitted any function to be performed. There was evidence that the applicant communicated with an unknown person who had viewed the page and obtained access to the website link.
	
	
	Charge 4 involved unauthorised access to an ACT Government account hosted on the Netspeed VM, which gave the applicant access to its Long Service Leave Authority account. Thereby he also gained access reserved for system and website administrators, impairing security of this system.
	
	
	Charge 5 involved unauthorised access to an account belonging to ATM Computers, also hosted on the Netspeed VM. Again the applicant gained access reserved for system and website administrators, impairing security of the system.
	
	
	In April 2014 it became public that a vulnerability known as “Heartbleed” was affecting certain computer systems. The applicant began researching that vulnerability and searching for remote access to sites which may have become vulnerable, using various means, to connect to targeted servers.
	
	
	Charge 6 concerned the applicant’s unauthorised access to a Telstra Corporation Limited server, using the Heartbleed vulnerability. This system included internet names, user names, as well as password and billing information. Telstra captured the internet traffic between its server and the applicant’s computer. His intention was disclosed to have been to upload further exploits, in order to impair the server’s security.
	
	
	Charge 7 involved unauthorised access to a Computer Sciences Corporation website and discussions about further exploits being pursued to gain further access, which resulted in him gaining unauthorised access to another database and attempting to modify the server, to gain further access to the system.
	
	
	Charges 8-24 were matters listed on a form for the purposes of s 16BA and taken into account in sentencing. Charges 8 to 16 involved attempts to gain unauthorised access using the Heartbleed vulnerability to identified State and Federal Government’s servers, which mostly failed because they were not vulnerable to Heartbleed attacks. Counts 17-19 involved three further attempts to gain unauthorised access to other Australian servers. Counts 20-24 involved repeated attempts to gain unauthorised access to international servers including those belonging to NASA, NATO, the United Nations and the American Department of Defence.
	
	
	The applicant was also involved in conversations with others as to vulnerable servers he had identified and steps he was going to pursue, to obtain access to them.
	
	
	On arrest and execution of a search warrant at his home, numerous electronic devices were seized. In his police interview the applicant made certain admissions. At the time of the commission of his offences he was subject to a good behaviour bond under s 33(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), for an earlier cybercrime offence.
	
	
	The Crown’s case on sentence was that, given the number of attacks involved in his offending, the number of victims and the sustained nature of those attacks, when considered with his networking with similar minded hackers, his criminal conduct was serious.
	
	
	It was conceded that it was relevant that the Form 1 offences involving Government bodies did not involve harm, but rather attempts at offending. Further, it was accepted to be relevant that while security of various systems had been impaired, there was no actual harm or change to data in accounts, even though there had been access to private information.
	
	
	While it was agreed that the applicant had boasted about his activities, on sentence his case was that there was no evidence that he had caused actual damage, other than impairing security, or that he had financial or other malicious motives for his offending. Accordingly, the seriousness of his offending was in issue.
	
	
	Offending such as this has long been recognised to be potentially serious. In R v Stevens [1999] NSWCCA 69 it was observed at [54]:
	


“The applicant’s offences must be regarded as grave. Computer technology plays an important role in modern society. The potential for harm by computer abuse of the type that occurred in this case, in a society which is becoming increasingly dependent upon computers, requires that considerations of deterrence, not only of the offender but of others who might be tempted to offend in a similar way, should be adequately reflected when it comes to sentence.”


	
	Culver DCJ concluded at p8-9, that:
	


“I am of the view that these offences are indeed serious offences for the reasons that firstly, the offender committed these offences over a period of some six months. Secondly, the offender targeted numerous victims. Thirdly, the offender engaged in behaviour that was in some respects and to some extent communicated with others potentially opening up access to confidential information by others, or at least another, being Larson.

Fourthly, the offender furthermore has targeted information which is not just simply confidential commercial information, but potentially gave access to I very private and personal information. For example, to hack into the system where the offender had access to the ACT Long Service Leave Board presumably has a potential to reveal quite personal information.

A consideration of the seriousness of the matter cannot be conducted without considering the next item under section 16A(2) and that is in subs (c). The Court is required to consider if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consistent with a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character. Whilst one might assume that hacking would ordinarily occur in a course of conduct, there are matters that deal with one offence, with one considered effort by an offender or one set of acts in order to commit the hacking offence. Here, however, the Crown is not only relying on multiple offences but also multiple acts by the offender in order to complete an offence. I am of the view that a course of conduct is revealed and that adds to the seriousness of these offences as I have described.”


	
	On appeal it was argued that in the absence of harm caused to the victims, the finding that the offending was serious, or particularly serious, was not open.
	
	
	That may not be accepted. In reaching the conclusion that this offending was serious, her Honour had proper regard to the number of attacks involved in the applicant’s offending; the time over which it was pursued; the potential harm that the applicant was prepared to facilitate, by facilitating access to the confidential data bases he targeted to at least one other like-minded person. Her Honour also took into account that while, unlike his earlier offending, there was no evidence that he had defaced the sites he had accessed, she did not accept that this offending had been pursued in order to appeal to prospective employers, as he had claimed when interviewed by the author of the pre-sentence report. That was because this would require the applicant to reveal both his identity and his criminal conduct, after having taken various steps to hide his real identity. In the result she concluded that as a matter of common sense, his offending was pursued to give him notoriety in the hacking world, that is, amongst like-minded and criminally intended people.
	
	
	These were all proper matters to take into account and left the conclusion that this was serious offending well open. The unauthorised introduction of programs into the various targeted websites the subject of charges 1 and 3 involved modifications which impaired their security, making them more vulnerable to attack, by giving access to information and privileges otherwise restricted. During the Heartbleed attacks it was such vulnerability which the applicant was attempting to exploit. That was all serious offending. No error has been made shown in her Honour’s conclusion, notwithstanding that actual further damage did not result and that he did not obtain financial advantage. The substantial risks of damage which his actions gave rise to, may not be overlooked.
	
	
	With respect to the specific sentence for charge 6, two factors were important and sufficient to justify the higher sentence imposed. First, the attack resulted in 1,500 responses that involved downloading (“exfiltration”) of data to the applicant’s computer. Secondly, the sentence reflected the fact that 17 other offences listed on the s 16BA schedule were taken into account. Several involved attempts to gain access to multiple servers.
	
	
	This ground must be dismissed.
	


Ground 2- the sentence was manifestly excessive


	
	Culver DCJ observed at p3-4:
	


“The Court, when sentencing an offender for Commonwealth offences, must take into account and consider the features of s 16A of the Crimes Act. The parties have each provided written submissions which have been taken into account as have their oral submissions in that regard. It is the Crown's position in these proceedings that the offender should be sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment insofar as it is a sentence which is required to appropriately reflect the severity of all the circumstances arising in this case. Therefore, it is the Crown's submission that s 16A(1) is triggered by these circumstances.

Turning to a consideration of the matters in s 16 A(1), the Crown urges the Court to consider that this is a matter deserving of emphasis on general deterrence. I am in agreement with that position. These type of computer hacking offences have the capacity to remain undetected until the risk of extensive damage eventuates. Whilst it may be the case that extensive damage was not actually caused by the offences in this case, when one considers the risk of extensive damage, or extensive disclosure of confidential information, then general deterrence is a vehicle by which such a risk can be minimised in the future.

Let me be very clear, the offender will only be sentenced for the offences he has committed, but those offences clearly involved considerable risk of damage to the reputation of the organizations whose systems were hacked into and a considerable risk of disclosure of sensitive and confidential information. It is that risk that can and ought to be reflected in the emphasis upon general deterrence. As stated by the Crown, it is clear that hacking offences of this kind which target computer networks fundamental to the proper functioning of government departments are very serious and must attract a significant component of general deterrence. The Crown in that regard has provided the court with a number of authorities which in my view are consistent in urging consideration of general deterrence in cases of this nature. I do not see any controversy in that proposition.”


	
	The applicant was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with an order that he be released on recognisance of $5,000 to be of good behaviour, after serving 12 months. The individual sentences were (at p14 - 15):
	


“In respect of sequence 1, the sentence is the sentence of imprisonment of 18 months. It commences today's date being 15 October 2015 and expires at the end of 14 April 2017.

In respect of sequence 3, that is a 12-month sentence of imprisonment. As that offending occurred in the same time frame as sequence 1, I am of the view it is appropriate that sentence commence on the same date, today's date being 15 October 2015 with that matter expiring at the end of 14 October 2016.

For sequence number 6, for which I have taken into account the offences on the certificate, I am of the view that that matter is so serious that it is deserving of a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment. Because it occurred in a different time frame, it will commence six months from now, on 15 April 2016, meaning that it will expire at the end of 14 October 2018.

For sequence number 7, that is a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months, it will commence in ten months time, on 15 August 2016, meaning that that matter will expire at the end of 14 February 2018.”


	
	The applicant’s case was that the sentence imposed was unreasonable and plainly unjust, given the low level of objective seriousness of his offending, his age, prospects of rehabilitation and early plea, and the assessment that he was at low/medium risk of reoffending. It was also submitted that the indicative sentence for count 6, of two and a half years was itself suggestive of excess, given the sentences indicated for the other three principal offences, even though that offence involved both unauthorised access and the taking of data.
	
	
	It was relevant on this sentence that at the time of his offending, the applicant was on 12 months’ probation for other similar offences under ss 477.2, 478.1 and 478.3 of the Criminal Code. Further, because the applicant asked that 17 other offences be taken into account under s 16BA, the sentence otherwise imposed upon him also had to be increased. As observed in R v Lamella [2014] NSWCCA 122 at [48]:
	


“Section 16BA Crimes Act (Cth) permits the court, with the consent of the prosecutor, to take into account other Federal offences to which an offender has pleaded guilty. There is, in my view, no reason to think that Spigelman CJ's approach in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 to New South Wales offences included on a Form 1 does not apply to Federal offences included on a schedule. Spigelman CJ considered at [42] that offences included on a Form 1 are to be taken into account to increase the penalty otherwise appropriate by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences.”


	
	That being so, it is not open to conclude that a lower sentence ought to have been imposed on the applicant for his offences. Her Honour took proper account of his plea, which she accepted demonstrated that he had taken responsibility for his offences, his evident immaturity, despite the absence of any evidence of psychological impairment, his references, his assessed risk of reoffending, and his prospects of rehabilitation, given his youth. Her Honour also took account, as she was obliged to do, of the need to have regard to general and specific deterrence, particularly given that the applicant was on a bond at the time of this offending.
	
	
	Her Honour’s conclusion that a custodial sentence was required, given the totality of the applicant’s offending, that he was on a bond for similar offending and because of the course of conduct which he had pursued over a period of time, against a number of victims, was correct.
	
	
	There was no error in either the sentences imposed for the individual offences, in circumstances where each offence attracted a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment or in her Honour’s approach to questions of concurrence and accumulation.
	
	
	In the result, this ground of appeal must also be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would propose are:
	



	
	Notice of motion dismissed.
	
	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	WILSON J: I agree with Schmidt J.

2701489,R v Birch [2016] NSWSC 816,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 3 December 2014 Luke Robert Birch was arrested and charged with the murder of his partner Carol Penrith. He has been in custody since then and has pleaded guilty to the charge. The offence arose out of a domestic violence situation.
	


Circumstances of the Offence


	
	There are agreed facts that the parties have submitted to the Court and which form the basis for the sentence that the Court is required to impose.
	
	
	The offender and the deceased, both of whom are Aboriginal, were in a relationship for approximately three years. During that time there were incidents of domestic violence, evidence of which has been adduced. These resulted in physical injury to the deceased but no convictions, mostly because charges were not pressed by her and no formal complaint was forthcoming.
	
	
	Domestic violence is an insidious and concerning aspect of some relationships and remains prevalent in some Aboriginal communities. In my view, in the case of Aboriginal men, and some women, it often results from the disempowerment they themselves feel and their exercise violently of control in one area where they perceive they have some power.
	
	
	The foregoing is an attempt to understand the phenomenon, not condone it. The partner, who is or perceives herself or sometimes himself to be weaker does their relationship, themselves and their partners no favours by failing to report incidents or withdrawing complaints. Such failure prevents treatment or education from occurring and entrenches a violent relationship. An offender who is violent, but is perceived to love the victim or as otherwise a good person, will not change behaviours without treatment.
	
	
	Nevertheless this relationship was not one in which the offender had been charged or convicted for domestic violence. He had other violent offences on his record.
	
	
	It seems the altercations in the relationship arose on occasions when the offender and the deceased were drinking or consuming drugs and usually when the offender perceived that the deceased had hidden or taken money, sometimes as little as $5 that he had wanted to use to gamble or drink or otherwise.
	
	
	On Thursday, 27 November 2014, the deceased and the offender were consuming alcohol all day and had been for the two days prior thereto. They had friends or relatives over to their house. The deceased left to drink elsewhere and returned to continue drinking at home. Most of the guests left. The offender’s brother initially commenced to leave only to return because he was hungry.
	
	
	The brother had previously sought to wake the offender but could not. Both the offender and the deceased were extremely drunk. When the brother returned the offender and the deceased were each awake.
	
	
	The offender was looking for his key card, which on previous occasions had been hidden by the deceased to prevent, for example, use of rent money or the like. The offender accused the deceased of hiding the key card on this occasion.
	
	
	The offender and his brother looked for the card and the deceased seemed to try and assist. The offender and the deceased were arguing and swearing at each other. A glass was knocked from the kitchen bench which caused a small scratch to the deceased despite the effort of the offender to prevent her being injured.
	
	
	Finally, the offender’s brother, after offering to pay so the offender would go with him, left. The offender and the deceased were home alone.
	
	
	When the offender’s brother was outside the door to the premises, he heard noises emanating from inside, being the deceased making noises as the offender sounded like he was punching her in the abdomen.
	
	
	The offender’s brother banged on the door and shouted for the offender to stop. He did not. The assault continued. At one stage the offender threatened to fight his brother, accusing him of “being interested in” the deceased.
	
	
	The brother described the offender as being out of control and in a rage. When the assault concluded, the brother was able to obtain entry. He described the offender as drunk and saw the deceased rise from the floor, lie on the couch, roll a cigarette all the while moaning. Apparently the brother left and the offender at some later time crashed on the bed, asleep. What occurred in the meantime is unknown.
	
	
	At 7am the next morning, 28 November 2014, the brother returned to the residence using a rear sliding door. The deceased was lying on her back in the hallway, was cold to touch and was apparently dead. The offender was still asleep. The brother woke him. The offender was shocked, cradled the deceased and started to cry.
	
	
	At 11am the offender attended the police station. He sat crying and could not speak. An address was obtained by police who attended the premises and found the deceased’s body.
	
	
	The autopsy reveals that the cause of death were two lacerations to the heart. These lacerations bled into the heart causing death.
	
	
	The autopsy revealed multiple fractures to the ribcage. Ten ribs were fractured and two were showing signs of healing from recent fractures. One or more of the fractured ribs would have pierced the heart causing death. There was also bleeding into the small bowel mesentery as a result of blows to the stomach.
	
	
	Other less serious injuries were also evident. Plainly multiple blows were inflicted. This was a brutal attack on a weaker, vulnerable and drunk partner by the offender while he too was drunk.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	It is necessary to look at the subjective circumstances of the offender. The Court has the benefit of a psychologist’s report from Ms Robilliard.
	
	
	The offender’s family background is sadly common and he experienced abuse, violence and an environment of alcohol abuse and deprivation from infancy. His care was undertaken by his mother, his grandparents and by foster carers and institutions. He was homeless in his teenage years. He had lived as a victim in refuges, a report from which, including care reports, are now before the Court.
	
	
	Unsurprisingly in the circumstances he was in trouble at school from an early age and was eventually “expelled”, as he described it. He has had limited employment and at the time of the offence was living on social security, as was the deceased.
	
	
	Ms Robilliard describes the dysfunction of the offender’s life. He fits the Fernando criteria (see, Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571) and must be considered accordingly: R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. Those factors do not allow the fixing of an inappropriately inadequate sentence that fails to recognise the seriousness of the offence. The offender abuses drugs and alcohol to block out his early trauma.
	
	
	The offender has shown full remorse and, with proper treatment and supervision, has sound prospects of rehabilitation. The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and will receive a discount on sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea at 25% with certain roundings: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	


Consideration


	
	The injuries that were sustained by the deceased were significant. There was a significant degree of violence exhibited. That is disturbing. Nevertheless I do not consider that Mr Birch intended to kill the deceased or wanted her to die even at the height of the attack.
	
	
	This is a domestic violence situation. I do not consider that the failure to provide a key card, if it were the case, which I doubt, amounts to provocation either to excuse or to lessen culpability.
	
	
	I have no doubt that the offender intended to occasion grievous bodily harm or very serious injury. I do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the deceased. Indeed, I find that he did not intend to do so. I hasten to add that the Crown does not suggest an intention to kill.
	
	
	I do not consider that the level of violence involved gratuitous cruelty. It was certainly violent but it did not suggest that the infliction of pain was an end in itself: see, McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 at [30], per Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed. In the words of the Court of Criminal Appeal it is completely unnecessary in order to form a proper assessment of the seriousness of this crime inflicted upon the deceased to introduce the concept of gratuitous cruelty. It adds nothing significant to the description of what was an assault upon a vulnerable woman.
	
	
	Fundamental in assessing the combination of objective and subjective factors, is the dysfunctional childhood suffered by the offender to which I have referred albeit somewhat summarily. I agree with Simpson J in R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 at [69] that a person who has had that kind of start in life does not bear equal moral responsibility with one who has had a “normal”, whatever that mean, or “advantaged” upbringing.
	
	
	Her Honour said:
	


“Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions … That his background is a relevant consideration affording some (although limited) mitigation is entirely consistent with the approach taken by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, a decision which has repeatedly been followed in this Court.”


	
	Of course, Fernando was given approval by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 249 CLR 571, as was the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 260.
	
	
	The previous personal violence acts are relevant in determining the degree to which specific deterrence and punishment are given a greater preponderance and in so doing where in the range available from the objective circumstances of the offence, the sentence to be imposed upon the offender should lie.
	
	
	I assess the objective gravity of the offence as at or about the midrange of conduct to which the charge of murder applies.
	
	
	The Court has had the benefit of statements relating to victim impact. For my own part all murders have an impact upon the family of the kind that has been suggested. Nothing that the Court can do will bring the deceased back. Her family continues to suffer and will continue to suffer. This is true of every murder, indeed, it is true of every killing occasioned by acts of violence.
	
	
	Murder, as I have already stated, is the most serious of offences and is seen as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. It has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment. A full-time custodial sentence is plainly warranted.
	
	
	Sentencing involves the resolution of goals that pull in different directions and often conflict. They include the protection of society, the deterrence of the offender, the deterrence of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution or punishment and reform or rehabilitation.
	
	
	As is often stated, the goals overlap and cannot be considered in isolation. Sometimes, even seemingly conflicting goals, overlap. The best means of protecting society is to ensure full rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is also the single most effective deterrence of the offender committing offences of the same kind.
	
	
	Nevertheless punishment is required, general deterrence is required and while hope may spring eternal, the reality of sentencing is that rehabilitation is unfortunately not always successful. In some cases, such as this, while personal deterrence is at first blush an important element, the spontaneous nature of this offence and its lack of premeditation and planning suggest that no conscious intention has been brought to bear. The intention to inflict really serious injury was momentary but fatal. On the other hand that spontaneity involves a greater need to have regard to the protection of society, at least until such time as society can be confident that rehabilitation has occurred.
	
	
	Sentencing is an intuitive process in which the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender are considered together with the guidepost of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole periods in order to arrive at a result that implements the purposes of sentencing to which mention has been made and which are prescribed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	As is expressed above, I have had regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in s 21A of the Crimes(Sentencing Procedure) Act, although not by way of checklist. I indicate a starting head sentence of 27 years, but round the results of the discount.

		20 June 2016",2016-06-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701497,R v Turnbull (No. 24) [2016] NSWSC 830,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The sentencing hearing has commenced with respect to the Offender, Ian Robert Turnbull, in connection with the crimes of murder and detaining for advantage.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to rely on victim impact statements as part of the sentencing hearing. The first victim impact statement upon which reliance is to be placed is that of Alison McKenzie, the wife of Mr Glen Turner, the murder victim.
	
	
	Objection has been taken to parts of the victim impact statement by senior counsel for the Offender. It is submitted that the parts which are objected to do not fall within the definition of “victim impact statement” contained in s.26 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which is defined to mean, in the case of a family victim, “the impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family”.
	
	
	It is also submitted that parts of the statement do not comply with Clause 10(6) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Regulation 2010 which states that victim impact statements must not contain, amongst other things, anything that is “offensive”.
	
	
	The parts of the victim impact statement which are objected to have been identified by senior counsel for the Offender (T5-7, 15 June 2016). It is submitted that parts of them go beyond what is the “impact” of the death of Mr Turner upon Ms McKenzie, or, alternatively, in some respects the content is not permissible because of Clause 10(6) of the Regulation.
	
	
	It is the case that parts of the statement refer to the perception of Ms McKenzie concerning the motivation of the Offender in killing Mr Turner, and in other places, to the impact of the trial process upon her. There are at times terms used which are strong in their content.
	
	
	The making of victim impact statements forms a very important part of sentencing, in particular with respect to homicide cases. The law in this State has developed considerably in recent times, so that appropriate recognition should be given to the impact upon the surviving relatives of murder victims of crimes which have deprived them of the primary victim.
	
	
	The term ""impact"" in s.26, in the definition of “victim impact statement”, should not be construed narrowly. The impact of the death of a person on the members of that person's immediate family extends to the influence or effect of the death. It is not confined to the immediate impact. It is not confined to immediate issues of grief, but to the devastation that can be caused to the family of a murder victim. It can extend, in my view, to the thought processes of the victims which, at times, may involve strong feelings with respect to the perpetrator, and what (in their view) may have motivated the perpetrator. To exclude matters of that sort, in my view, would narrowly and artificially confine the very process by which victim impact statements are made.
	
	
	In determining whether any particular phrase contained in a victim impact statement may be considered offensive for the purpose of Clause 10(6) of the Regulation, it is necessary to bear in mind the context of the statement including the facts of the case and related issues. Strong feelings may be expressed.
	
	
	It will be a matter for the Court, in due course, to pass sentence according to law.
	
	
	However, in my view, the matters raised on behalf of the Offender, by way of objection to the victim impact statement of Ms McKenzie, ought not be upheld. I overrule the objections to the victim impact statement which may be given in the terms in which it presently stands.

		21 June 2016",2016-06-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701504,Korolak v Bauer Media Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 98,"Judgment


	
	The defendant brings an application pursuant to r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) for a ruling that none of the pleaded imputations is capable of being conveyed and, pursuant to UCPR r 28.4, for judgment for the defendant to be entered.
	
	
	The matter complained of, which is set out as a schedule to this judgment, is an unusual publication in that, apart from the headlines and layout, the whole of its contents are the plaintiff’s own life story “as told to Sonja Kowanjko” (see paragraph 3 of the schedule below). Written in the first person as one of a series of personal stories published by Take 5 magazine, this paid story (“WE PAY MORE! Up to $2,000 for your story” – paragraph 51) tells how the plaintiff (a hard-working law student with a loving relationship with her mother) coped with her mother’s murder by the plaintiff’s own brother, and her eventual recovery from this family tragedy.
	
	
	The contents of the matter complained of may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	The matter complained of starts with a description of how the plaintiff, a law student with a loving relationship with her mother, was living away from home in a university college when her “nothing but trouble” (paragraph 11) brother and his three teenage friends murdered her mother for financial gain.
	
	
	The plaintiff next describes her ensuing health and emotional problems and her anger after her grandparents told her that her brother needed her help because “you’re a lawyer” (paragraph 24), a request she angrily refused. She then describes the trial at which her brother and his accomplices were found guilty.
	
	
	The balance of the matter complained of describes the years it took before she could come to terms with this “unthinkable” (Headline 3A, paragraph 38) tragedy and “heal her broken heart” (paragraph 49), with a description (illustrated by photographs of the plaintiff with her new husband and baby) of the resolution of these emotional problems, how she gave up her law career due to the stress of the court proceedings and changed professions, how she confronted her brother in jail but decided to forgive him, and how she then obtained a fresh start in life with a new family in a new country, Australia.
	



	
	The imputations pleaded to arise are:
	


4(a) The plaintiff was the sort of person who would kill her mother at the request of her brother.

4(b) The plaintiff was the sort of person who would help her brother in the killing of their mother.

4(c) The plaintiff was an accessory to the killing of her mother.

4(d) The plaintiff is a serious criminal.


	
	There is no suggestion any of these imputations could arise from the text of the matter complained of independently of the first of three headlines to the matter complained of, which are:
	



	
	“My jealous brother KILLED OUR MUM…and asked ME to help him” (front cover and index);
	
	
	“THE BROTHER FROM HELL” (the headline, in capitals, of the article on pages 56 – 57 of Take 5); and
	
	
	“How could he do something so unthinkably evil?” (the sub-headline of the article on pages 6 - 7), followed by the plaintiff’s name and address as the source for this story.
	



	
	Each of the imputations pleaded is argued to arise from the headline in 2(a) and from a boxed subheading “I knew it was Ron who had hurt her”. Mr Rasmussen also relies, for identification purposes, on the name of the plaintiff as appearing below the third of these headlines.
	
	
	Unlike Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2015] FCA 652 (the social media and poster publications reliant upon a headline only), the parties agree that the matter complained of is the whole of the material in the schedule set out at the end of this judgment. Mr Rasmussen also confirmed, in response to a request to do so from Mrs Barnett, that the matter complained of is the whole of the schedule, and not the parts objected to by the plaintiff (i.e. the first headline and the layout of the boxed sub-headline).
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen also accepts that the imputations pleaded are the ones by which his client stands or falls, in that if these imputations are not capable of being conveyed, there would not be any application to replead, as there is no other imputation capable of being conveyed.
	


The tests to apply for summary dismissal under UCPR r 28.4


	
	There are two tests, each with a very high threshold, to apply to the defendant’s application under UCPR rr 28.2 and 28.4.
	
	
	The first relates to the circumstances in which courts will strike out an imputation on the basis that the matter complained of is not capable, at a threshold level, of conveying an imputation. The relevant principles are set out in Corby v Allen & Unwin Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 227 at [135]-[136], namely that the determination of capacity at the threshold level is “an exercise in generosity not parsimony”, as well as being a “matter of impression… the impression is not of what the words mean but of what a jury could sensibly think they meant”. That differs from the consideration of such issues at the trial.
	
	
	The defendant’s application is that no defamatory imputations are capable of being distilled at all. This is not a case where there is a challenge to the defamatory meaning of an imputation (Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 418 at [6]), or a submission by the defendant that the antidote outweighs the bane; these are issues best left to the tribunal of fact, as both counsel acknowledge.
	
	
	A high test applies in summary judgment applications on the basis of total absence of defamatory meaning. Only in the clearest cases would such an issue not go to the jury at trial: Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1979] 2 NSWLR 679n. Even at trial, the test to be applied, according to Herron CJ is the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125. The extreme caution to be used when exercising the summary power is necessary because, as Herron CJ noted, a judge sitting alone should avoid “driving the plaintiff from the judgment seat”. That is all the more the case in a capacity hearing where summary judgment is sought, and Bik v Mirror Newspapers Ltd must therefore be treated with caution.
	


The role of the headline


	
	The central issue in this argument is what to make of the first headline and whether it is capable of conveying, either by itself or as part of the matter complained of, any defamatory imputation. As is noted above, the plaintiff’s argument is that, out of the more than 50 paragraphs, three main headings, two “boxed” quotes, three newspaper reproductions and three photographs, the imputations pleaded all arise from the front page heading (repeated in the contents page), with additional reliance upon one of the boxed quotes (about an earlier incident of violence by the plaintiff’s brother).
	
	
	As to capacity generally, Mr Rasmussen emphasised that the function of the court in determining the capacity of these imputations as being to set the outside boundaries of the possible ranges of meanings, and that this is an exercise in generosity and not parsimony (Corby at [133] – [136] per McColl JA). What Mr Rasmussen called the “salacious” nature of the publication meant that the wide degree of latitude given to the capacity to convey (Lewis v Daily Telegraph [1961] AC 234 at 374) should be interpreted with particular generosity in this case because of the importance of headlines.
	
	
	As to the role of the headline, Mr Rasmussen submitted that an ordinary reasonable reader would emphasise the content of headlines when gaining a general impression, and would be prone to loose thinking as a result. This means that the role of a headline is such that it can overshadow meanings to the contrary in the text of the matter complained of: Chakravarti v The Advertiser Newspapers (1998) 193 CLR 519 at [134] (“Chakravarti”) per Kirby J; Mirror Newspapers Ltd v World Hosts Pty Ltd (1979) 141 CLR 632 at 646 per Aicken J; see also Morgan v Odham’s Press [1971] 1 WLR 1239 at 1245 and 1270.
	
	
	Before considering Kirby J’s statements in Chakravarti, I shall first summarise Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 AC 65 (“Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd”), the decision which Kirby J stated (albeit obiter) should not be followed in Australia.
	
	
	In Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd, there were a series of headlines, some of which contained potentially defamatory meanings. These were: “Strewth! What's Harold up to with our Madge?""; an outline map of Australia bearing the words ""Censored down under""; “Porn Shocker for Neighbours stars”; ""Soap studs: Harold and Madge's faces are added to porn actors' bodies in a scene from the game"" and ""Ramsay rave: 'Madge' in kinky leather gear""). These were illustrated by photographs of the plaintiffs’ faces superimposed on near-naked bodies of models engaged in pornographic poses, with the caption ""Victims: Ian and Anne."". The text of the publication contained expressions of outrage about the pornographic computer game which had been used to superimpose the faces of individuals without their knowledge or consent upon the bodies of others.
	
	
	The plaintiffs in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd agreed that the antidote in the article (and some of the headlines) was sufficient to neutralise any bane in the headlines and photographs. The issue for determination (on a summary judgment basis) was whether the headlines could be severed as a separate publication, on the basis that the headlines alone could permit, to the limited number of readers who only read the headlines, a defamatory meaning to be conveyed.
	
	
	The House of Lords upheld the decisions of the primary judge and of the English Court of Appeal that the publications were incapable of being severed to give rise to what was effectively a separate publication, rejecting a proposition that “the prominent headline, or as here the headlines plus photographs, may found a claim in libel in isolation from its related text, because some readers only read headlines” (per Lord Bridge of Harwich at 73).
	
	
	This reasoning was attacked by Kirby J in Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd:
	


“Their Lordships upheld the decisions of the primary judge and of the English Court of Appeal, sustaining the publisher's objection that the publications were incapable of being defamatory. They rejected the proposition that “the prominent headline, or as here the headlines plus photographs, may found a claim in libel in isolation from its related text, because some readers only read headlines”. They declared that such reasoning was “unacceptable”. Respectfully, I cannot agree with their Lordships’ opinion. In my view it ignores the realities of the way in which ordinary people receive, and are intended to receive, communications of this kind. It ignores changes in media technology and presentation. It removes remedies from people whose reputation may be greatly damaged by casual or superficial perception of such publications. And it overlooks the purpose of defamation law which is to provide redress when reputations are damaged in fact, not to reserve remedies to those cases only where detailed and thorough analysis of the matter complained of has been undertaken. I agree with the criticisms which have been voiced about Charleston. Many people, including not a few judges and jurors, do not look beyond headlines and photographs. If this is the environment in which reputations may be harmed, it would be contrary to the purposes of the law of defamation to withhold redress from cases where harm was held to be done. To the extent that dicta in Charleston or other cases suggest that the courts should attribute to the recipients of matter published in the mass media a close and careful attention to the entirety of the item published, I would not follow that opinion. I would not adopt its reasoning as part of the common law of Australia. To do so would be to defy common experience and, if I may say so, common sense.” [Citations omitted]


	
	Kirby J went on to note the importance of graphics, photographs and other visual lures designed to attract the reader into reading an article either in traditional print media or online.
	
	
	Kirby J’s obiter statements as to the ability of persons to read headlines without reading more have been treated with a degree of caution, not only within the sphere of defamation actions but also in relation to other areas of the law, such as contempt of court (see, for example The Herald & Weekly Times v A-G [2001] VSCA 152 at [25]). In Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186 [17] (“Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd”), the High Court confirmed that the ordinary reasonable reader not only considers the publication as a whole but considers the context as well. The ordinary reasonable reader, especially of a salacious (or simply colourful) publication, will give considerable weight to conspicuous headlines or captions: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin (2003) 201 ALR 77 at [26]–[27]; Mirror Newspapers Ltd v World Hosts Pty Ltd at 646. However, in so doing, that reader will not be avid for scandal: Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd (259–260); John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin at [26]. The issue determined by the House of Lords in Charleston v News Group Newspapers Ltd – namely that there is no separate cause of action for a defamation claim based on the limited number of readers who only read headlines – is unarguably correct.
	
	
	Although in a trial context, the capacity of a headline to convey imputations also arose in Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd, where the plaintiff brought proceedings for publications headed “Treasurer for Sale” or “Treasurer Hockey for Sale”. White J noted McHugh J’s comments in relation to the impact of headlines in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin at [26] as follows:
	


“[26] … A reasonable reader considers the publication as a whole. Such a reader tries to strike a balance between the most extreme meaning that the words could have and the most innocent meaning. The reasonable reader considers the context as well as the words alleged to be defamatory. If “[i]n one part of [the] publication, something disreputable to the plaintiff is stated, but that is removed by the conclusion; the bane and antidote must be taken together.“ But this does not mean that the reasonable reader does or must give equal weight to every part of the publication. The emphasis that the publisher supplies by inserting conspicuous headlines, headings and captions is a legitimate matter that readers do and are entitled to take into account. Contrary statements in an article do not automatically negate the effect of other defamatory statements in the article.” (Citations omitted)


	
	White J went on to state that in Mirror Newspapers Ltd v World Hosts Pty Ltd at 646 Aickin J noted that the emphasis by way of headline or other method given by a publisher is not to be ignored, and that “[t]o say that consideration must be given to the publication as a whole does not mean that the court must give equal significance to each part of the publication” (Hockey v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd at [71]). That is the highest that submissions about headings may be put.
	
	
	White J was determining the issue of capacity in a trial context, not in relation to a threshold challenge to capacity, in circumstances where there was a “bane and antidote” argument. White J’s comments, like those of Kirby J in Chakravarti, are essentially of value as to the degree of attention paid by the ordinary reasonable reader when reading the whole of the matter complained of.
	


The interaction of the first headline with the balance of the publication and context


	
	The first headline and the boxed content are only part of the headings, photographs and layout, all of which were referred to by Kirby J in Chakravarti as being of importance to the loose-thinking reader. Additionally, as the High Court noted in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd, context, and of course content, are important.
	
	
	I make the following observations as to these features in the matter complained of:
	



	
	The other headings and photographs: Only the first of the headings (and a boxed subheading) is relied upon as capable of giving rise to the imputations pleaded. That requires the ordinary reasonable reader to ignore not only the two other headings (a difficult step to take, as these are the headings for the text of the matter complained of) but also all the photographs. Mr Rasmussen acknowledges that anyone who just read the heading on the front cover or index would not know who the plaintiff was, which means they must read the plaintiff’s name on page 6 directly under the third subheading (“How could he do something so unthinkably evil?”). This becomes an exercise in selective reading, to the point of absurdity.
	
	
	The context: Mr Rasmussen submits that this is a “tell all” story with hooks to excite the reader into reading it, of which the first heading is the main one. However, the principal message contained in that context is that the plaintiff’s “tell-all story” is about the murder of her mother by “the brother from hell” and the anguish that caused her, with the genre-driven happy ending of the plaintiff coming to terms with her grief, complete with photographs of the plaintiff’s husband and baby. The context militates against defamatory meanings about the plaintiff arising.
	
	
	Layout: The plaintiff is named on page 6 directly under the heading “How could he do something so unthinkably evil?” as well as photographed grief-stricken at her mother’s funeral and (twice) with her new husband and baby, with captions to the effect that her baby has helped her to heal from this experience. It is revealed from the first that the plaintiff is telling her own story and that story is her outrage at what her brother did. None of this could support defamatory meanings arising.
	
	
	Narrative structure: Where the matter complained of is a story, the power of the narrative structure (especially in a “happy ending” story illustrated with photographs) is significant, in that it aids the ordinary reasonable reader to identify the relevant protagonists – who is the hero, who is the villain, and what the message or theme of the story is. The message likely to be taken away by the ordinary reasonable reader, even from the headings, is that the plaintiff is writing about her grief and anger that her brother “unthinkably” murdered their mother out of “jealousy”. The plaintiff’s role is as the heroine, not a wrongdoer.
	
	
	The rest of the matter complained of: Mr Rasmussen acknowledges that the rest of the matter complained of is incapable of conveying imputations defamatory of the plaintiff.
	



	
	When the above factors are also taken into account, the importance attributed to the first headline by Mr Rasmussen in conveying any imputation capable of defamatory meaning by reason of any asserted ambiguity of meaning can be seen to be misplaced.
	
	
	The body of the text could not make the meaning of “help” in this headline clearer. The plaintiff’s status as a law student (who later changes career and becomes a happy wife and mother) is central to the narrative structure, and thus to the imputations pleaded. This is of particular relevance when determining what to make from the word “help” in the first heading. From the opening words of the story, we are told that the plaintiff’s fateful last meal with her mother and brother is part of a rare visit home by the plaintiff who is studying law. She is told of the murder by the university dean and her response to the shock of the murder is to pour herself into her studies as a distraction. In this context, the circumstances in which the plaintiff’s grandparents plead with her to help her brother, saying “You’re a lawyer” and “he needs you” (paragraph 24) are not buried in an unremarkable and small paragraph as claimed by Mr Rasmussen, but part of the main (and repeated) thread of the narrative and thus highly significant to the meanings in the matter complained of. This is underlined by the revulsion the plaintiff expresses not only in relation to this request, but to her distress when she graduated without her mother and was unable to work as a lawyer because she “couldn’t face another courtroom” after the murder trial.
	
	
	Having made these preliminary observations, I next consider the imputations pleaded. The parties dealt with them in two groups, so I propose to do the same.
	


Imputations 4(a) and 4(b)


	
	Each of these imputations suffers from the same fatal difficulty. If the ordinary reasonable reader does construe any ambiguity in the heading “My jealous brother KILLED OUR MUM… and asked ME to help him” in the way advocated by Mr Rasmussen, how can his asking the plaintiff “to help him” impute any defamatory meaning as to her character?
	
	
	Mr Rasmussen submits that the mere fact that the plaintiff was asked to perform such an act indicates that she must be the sort of person likely to perform it. To adopt the language of McCallum J in Sharp v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2015] NSWSC 1536 at [9], this is, in the language of earlier jurisprudence in this field, a case of an “inference upon an inference”, namely an imputation only capable of arising by reason of missing steps between the matter complained of and the imputation conveyed.
	
	
	While there is no absolute rule precluding an inference upon an inference having the capacity to convey a defamatory imputation, the “ultimate question to be asked is whether the ordinary, reasonable person would treat the pleaded meaning as capable of being conveyed by the matter about which complaint is made” (Rayney v Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd [2014] WASC 129 at [35]).
	
	
	The fact that a person is asked to help with the commission of a crime is not, without more, capable of conveying an imputation of an act or condition of a defamatory nature.
	
	
	That is all the more the case because of the language of the heading. First, the brother committing the murder is described as motivated by being “jealous” (a state of mind which could not impute any wrongdoing to the plaintiff). The use of the phrase “our mum” and the degree of outrage conveyed by the use of the word “ME” in capital letters in the headline (although not on the index page) make the plaintiff’s disgust at his request for her help evident.
	
	
	For these reasons, not even the portions of the matter complained of relied upon by Mr Rasmussen can give rise to these imputations. Nor can the material in the box (to the effect that the plaintiff knew her brother had hurt her mother) overcome these hurdles.
	
	
	The lack of defamatory meaning of this headline is further reinforced by the storyline of the matter complained of, which underlines that the plaintiff is the good child who has gone to university to study law while her “nothing but trouble” brother has fallen in with a bad crowd. I accept Mrs Barnett’s submission that the ordinary reasonable reader would understand that the “help” referred to was her grandparents’ pleading with her to help her brother at his trial, because: “You’re a lawyer. He needs you.” (paragraph 24)
	
	
	I was not addressed as to whether any of the three boxed newspaper clipping headings (the third of which includes the word “helper”) assisted in the conveying of any meaning. I am, however, satisfied that the ordinary reasonable reader who considers the whole of the matter complained of, giving additional weight to headings in the manner advocated by Mr Rasmussen, would not consider that these newspaper headlines add anything to the capacity of any of the imputations pleaded; if anything, they convey a meaning to the contrary.
	
	
	Each of imputations 4(a) and 4(b) involves such “strained processes” of reasoning (Woodward v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 27 June 1996)) that neither is capable of arising. Each should accordingly be struck out.
	


Imputations 4(c) and 4(d)


	
	Imputation 4(c) is an attempt to capture a sting of the plaintiff knowing about a proposed killing of her mother, or of being asked for subsequent help with the murder, and to treat that knowledge as amounting to her being an accessory.
	
	
	For the same reasons set out above, I am satisfied that this imputation also fails the capacity test. The imputation as pleaded requires the ordinary reasonable reader to draw too many inferences, inferences which are contradicted by the words “jealous” and the capital letters for “ME” in the first heading.
	
	
	As to capacity of the headline to take on any meaning from the rest of the matter complained of, the crime was “unthinkable” and the language of all three headings (as well as the text) both show not only no foreknowledge, but that no help was given in the commission or concealment of the crime. I have already set out the passages which indicate the actual “help” the plaintiff was asked for.
	
	
	The context of the story (namely the narrative’s structure of suffering and healing), the role of the law student plaintiff in the narrative structure and the contents’ message of overwhelming grief and loss render this imputation incapable of arising from the whole of the matter complained of. No loose-thinking reader, even putting the worst connotation on “asked me for help” and the boxed subheading that the plaintiff “knew” her brother had previously hurt their mother physically, could come to the conclusion that this imputation arises.
	
	
	Imputations 4(d) is even more hopeless, in that the highest even the first headline puts the allegation against the plaintiff is that her brother asked her to help (which, from the tone of the heading, clearly was not given). The first headline makes it clear that she is indignant at such a request (by the use in capital letters for “ME”) and that the brother’s motivation for the crime is his own jealousy. That does not make her a criminal, let alone a serious criminal. Nor is any such imputation capable of arising from the whole of the matter complained of, even by a loose-thinking reader concentrating on the headlines.
	
	
	Imputations 4(c) and 4(d) are each not capable of being conveyed. Each should be struck out.
	


The orders to make


	
	Mrs Barnett submits that the statement of claim should not be dismissed, but that judgment should be entered for the defendants pursuant to UCPR r 28.4, in view of the inability of the matter complained of to convey any imputations defamatory of the plaintiff.
	
	
	As noted above, no submissions to the contrary were put by Mr Rasmussen. No leave is sought to replead any of the imputations in order to avoid the entry of summary judgment (cf International Financing and Investment Pty Ltd v Kent (Supreme Court of Western Australia, Bredmeyer M, 8 May 1997)).
	
	
	I accept Mrs Barnett’s submissions that this is one of those rare cases where no defamatory meaning of any kind is capable of arising. Accordingly I have entered judgment for the defendant.
	
	
	The parties have asked for liberty to apply as to the appropriate costs orders.
	


Orders


	
	Statement of claim dismissed; judgment for the defendant pursuant to UCPR r 28.4(2)(a).
	
	
	Liberty to apply in relation to costs, such liberty to be exercised in 28 days.

	The maximum penalty for count 1 on the indictment is imprisonment for five years or whichever is greater of a fine amounting to 4,500 penalty units and three times the total value of the benefits that have been obtained and are recently attributable to the commission of the offence or both. The maximum penalty for each of the other counts is imprisonment for 10 years with the same pecuniary penalty.
	
	
	The offences are contrary to s 1043A(1)(c) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
	


The facts of the offending


	
	Mr Hull holds a Bachelor of Accounting Science and a Post Graduate Diploma in Accounting.
	
	
	At the time of the offences Mr Hull had worked in corporate finance advisory services and funds management for approximately 10 years. From December 2004 until June 2006 he worked in the mergers and acquisitions team at ANZ. He subsequently worked at ABN AMRO and then from April 2008 to 30 September 2011 he was employed by Infrastructure Capital Group Limited (ICG) (formerly known as ANZ Infrastructure Services) in the role of Associate Director.
	
	
	In December 2004 Darren Wayne Thompson also commenced employment with ANZ and worked together with Mr Hull for a number of years. Mr Thompson remained at ANZ until he joined Credit Suisse (Australia) Limited in 2007. Between May 2007 and September 2011 Mr Thompson was employed by Credit Suisse Management Australia as vice president in the Investment Banking Department (IBD) in Sydney.
	
	
	After Mr Thompson joined Credit Suisse, he and Mr Hull remained close friends, maintaining frequent contact through emails, regular lunchtime runs, social gatherings of their families and occasional weekend camping trips.
	
	
	ICG manages Australasian infrastructure investments on behalf of large institutional investors. Mr Hull's role at ICG involved assessment and analysis of listed infrastructure funds and investment committee recommendations, as well as analysing complex financial models for investment purposes and negotiating terms for potential new investments. In his previous roles at ANZ Infrastructure Services and ABN AMRO he was involved in profiling takeover opportunities, valuation work, and managing acquisitions and divestments.
	
	
	As a condition of his employment with ICG Mr Hull was required to comply with policies set out in the company's Corporate Governance Manual (the Manual), including the Code of Conduct (The Code). The Code refers to a Staff Trading Policy, and the requirement by staff to comply with provisions designed to prevent insider trading.
	
	
	As a result of these policies Mr Hull had a general understanding of the legal prohibitions against insider trading.
	
	
	Credit Suisse is a global financial services company operating three global divisions; private banking, investment banking, and asset management. It has offices located in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
	
	
	The IBD provides advice to corporate clients of Credit Suisse in a range of services including corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, divestments, equity and debt raisings, initial public offerings and schemes of arrangements. The IBD also ""pitches"" to prospective or current clients. A pitch involves giving a sales presentation to a client or potential client, which provides an overview of a company or a particular industry or a proposed transaction, with the aim of securing a '""mandate"" to advise the client and act on their behalf.
	
	
	Mr Thompson's employment within the Sydney office of Credit Suisse predominantly involved him working on proposed transactions relating to public companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Some of these proposed transactions which, if sufficiently advanced and publicly announced, had potential to affect materially the price or value of financial products including securities relating to the company or companies involved.
	
	
	As a vice president in the IBD Mr Thompson was a senior support person on deal teams led by a Credit Suisse director or managing director who had the relationship with the client. Mr Thompson was part of the mergers and acquisition team within the IBD and was known for his technical expertise in public market transactions. He was involved in preparing and reviewing formal documentation for proposed corporate transactions, and undertaking financial modelling and valuations. As a senior member of a deal team he frequently engaged directly with clients and other third party advisors relating to proposed corporate transactions, and routinely acquired and had access to highly confidential information about proposed corporate transactions.
	
	
	At all material times Mr Hull knew that Mr Thompson was employed within the IBD at Credit Suisse. By virtue of Mr Hull's employment experience in the finance industry (particularly in investment banking) and his own role at ICG, he had an understanding of the type of advisory services that the IBD of Credit Suisse provided and Mr Thompson's role. Mr Hull understood that Mr Thompson routinely had access to information that was likely to include inside information because of his role at Credit Suisse.
	
	
	Mr Hull and Mr Thompson often communicated about aspects of their work, including Mr Hull actively inquiring about significant matters Mr Thompson was working on.
	
	
	Mr Hull has been an active investor in the stock market since 2004 and in his own estimation is a knowledgeable and experienced investor. In November 2005 he opened a share trading account with E*Trade Australia Securities Ltd (E*Trade) in the names of Michael Hull and his wife, Catriona Hull, being account number 3097662 (Hull trading account No. 3097662). On 26 May 2008 he opened a further share trading account with E*Trade in the names of Michael Hull and Catriona Hull, being account number 3722226 (Hull trading account No. 3722226). The Hull trading account No. 3722226 was the main share trading account through which he conducted trading during the period from June 2008 to 3 June 2011.
	
	
	At all material times Mr Thompson was aware that Mr Hull invested in the stock market. During their lunchtime runs Mr Hull and Mr Thompson regularly discussed the share market, potential investment ideas, performance of particular shares or sectors, and sought each other's views on particular stocks.
	


Count 1: Acquisition of shares in The Mac Services Group Limited


	
	Mr Hull's acquisition of five separate parcels of shares in Mac Services is the subject of Count 1 on the Indictment.
	
	
	In March 2010 Credit Suisse was verbally mandated by Mac Services Group Limited (Mac Services) to act as its advisor in relation to the possible sale or joint venture of its business (the Mac Services Transaction). At that time three separate parties, including Oil States International Inc. (Oil States), had shown an interest in either entering a partnering arrangement at both the project and corporate level with Mac Services, taking a stake in the business of Mac Services, or an outright purchase of the company.
	
	
	Shortly after being verbally engaged by Mac Services, Credit Suisse formed a deal team, consisting of staff largely from the IBD. The proposed Mac Services Transaction was known within Credit Suisse as ''Project Mars"" and ''Project Angus"". Despite the initial interest shown in Mac Services by potential parties in March 2010, there was little progress made by any of these parties over the ensuing five month period to further a transaction.
	
	
	In late August 2010 Mac Services received a confidential non-binding cash offer from Oil States for all the shares in Mac Services. At this time Credit Suisse was verbally engaged to assist Mac Services in evaluating the offer from Oil States and to act as its financial advisor. Following receipt of the offer from Oil States, Mr Thompson, while not a member of the Project Angus deal team, was called upon to provide advice to the deal team on specific aspects of the transaction given his expertise in public company mergers and acquisitions.
	
	
	On 1 September 2010 Mr Thompson assisted in drafting the scope section of an engagement letter for Credit Suisse and Mac Services, and advised on aspects of a confidentiality deed between Mac Services and Oil States. Mr Thompson also became aware at this time of an indicative announcement date for a completed transaction of 5 October 2010.
	
	
	At about 12.45 pm on 2 September 2010 Mr Hull and Mr Thompson met for a lunchtime run. During this run, or at some other time before 8 September 2010, Mr Thompson said to Mr Hull words to the effect of:
	


""Take a look at MAC Services'' and '""this stock is worth a punt.''


	
	On 3 September 2010 Mr Thompson received a copy of a non-binding offer letter from Oil States to Mac Services dated 2 September 2010 to review and comment. The Oil States offer letter referred to a cash offer of up to $3.60 per Mac Services share to all Mac Services shareholders subject to certain contingencies, and that the transaction would be implemented either through a takeover or scheme of arrangement.
	
	
	Other than reviewing the offer letter in early September 2010 Mr Thompson had little if any input into the transaction for the remaining weeks of September 2010. During this period due diligence was performed on Mac Services by Oil States and negotiations between the parties continued.
	
	
	On 8 September 2010 Mr Hull placed an order for 7,500 Mac Services shares at $2.90. The order was only partially filled on this day with 2,213 being acquired. The remaining balance of the order was cancelled on 27 September 2010 at 8.16am.
	
	
	Thereafter on 24, 28 and 30 September 2010 he placed orders to buy in total 15,000 Mac Service shares for $3.20 a share.
	
	
	In the meantime, on 27 September 2010 he met with Mr Thompson for a lunchtime run.
	
	
	In late September/early October 2010 Mac Services received a revised indicative offer from Oil States of $3.70.
	
	
	On 1 October 2010 Mr Thompson was requested to review a draft scheme implementation deed between Mac Services and Oil States, setting out the terms of the proposed scheme of arrangement. Mr Thompson had no further involvement in the transaction after providing feedback on the draft scheme implementation deed at this time.
	
	
	Between 8 September 2010 and 1 October 2010 Mr Hull, through a number of separate transactions, acquired a total of 17,213 Mac Services shares at prices between $2.90 and $3.20 for a total consideration of $54,418.
	
	
	On 4 October 2010 the Hull and Thompson families met for a children's birthday party.
	
	
	On 5 October 2010 Mr Hull placed an order to acquire 5000 Mac Services shares at $3.15. The order did not immediately fill.
	
	
	On 7 October 2010 he met Mr Thompson for a lunchtime run.
	
	
	At 2.35pm on 7 October 2010 Mr Hull placed an order to acquire 7500 Mac Services shares at $3.20. This order was not immediately filled. At 3.17pm on 8 October 2010 he amended the 5 October 2010 order to acquire 5000 Mac Services shares at $3.20. Again this order did not fill immediately. At 1.27pm on 8 October 2010 he amended the 7 October 2010 order to acquire 7500 Mac Services shares at $3.21. This order also did not fill immediately. Two further amendments between 3.57pm and 4.26pm to $3.23 and $3.21 respectively also did not result in a trade.
	
	
	Finally, following further amendments to both the 5 October 2010 and 7 October 2010 orders, each order traded on 11 October 2010 at $3.24 and $3.25 respectively.
	
	
	Altogether he purchased 29,713 Mac Services shares at prices of between $2.90 and $3.25 for a total consideration of $94,992.70.
	
	
	On 15 October 2010 Mac Services issued a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", entitled ""The Mac Services Announces $3.90 Per Share Recommended Proposed Acquisition by Oil States International” (the 15 October announcement) in which it was stated that Oil States proposed to acquire all of the shares in Mac Services for $3.90 cash per share (less any dividends declared or paid by Mac Services after 15 October), which represented a premium of 16.4% to the closing price of Mac Services shares on 14 October 2010 or a premium of 21.6% to the 30 day VWAP of Mac Services shares up to 14 October 2010.
	
	
	When trading in Mac Services shares on the ASX resumed following the 15 October announcement the opening price of Mac Services shares was $3.84 per share representing an increase of approximately $0.49 (or 14.63%) from its closing price of $3.35 on 14 October 2010, the last trading day prior to the announcement.
	
	
	On 18 October 2010 Mr Hull sold his entire holding in Mac Services at $3.85 per share for $114,395, realising a gross profit of $19,402.35.
	


Count 2: Acquisition of shares in Giralia Resources NL


	
	Mr Hull's acquisition of nine separate parcels of shares in Giralia is the subject of Count two on the Indictment.
	
	
	Giralia Resources NL was an Australia iron ore explorer whose ordinary fully paid shares traded on the ASX up until 6 April 2011.
	
	
	On 12 December 2010 Giralia Resources NL (Giralia) retained Credit Suisse to advise on strategic and financial planning matters specific to an offer from Atlas Iron Limited (Atlas), an emerging iron ore producer and explorer, to takeover Giralia (the Giralia Transaction). As at 12 December 2010 an in-principle agreement had been reached between Giralia and Atlas on a proposed transaction.
	
	
	The Giralia Transaction was given the code name ""Project Farm"" by Credit Suisse to maintain confidentiality of the transaction. Information about the Giralia Transaction was restricted within Credit Suisse to members of the Project Farm deal team. On 12 December 2010 the Credit Suisse manager of the transaction advised Mr Thompson of the Giralia Transaction.
	
	
	On the following day Mr Thompson travelled to Perth with other members of the deal team and met with representatives of Giralia to assist in progressing the transaction and discuss the terms and conditions of the offer received from Atlas, including the indicative offer price. Between 13 December and 14 December 2010 he attended various meetings concerning the proposed transaction and reviewed transaction documentation, such as draft implementation agreements, pre-bid agreements and the transaction timetable.
	
	
	By Tuesday, 14 December 2010, an announcement of the Giralia Transaction was imminent. In an email from Mr Thompson to Mr Brett Jolly of Credit Suisse on 14 December 2010 he stated ""we are hoping to announce next Monday"".
	
	
	At about 12.45 pm on 16 December 2010 Mr Hull and Mr Thompson met for one of their regular lunchtime runs. During the course of the run Mr Thompson said to Mr Hull words to the following effect:
	


""Giralia is a good opportunity. Giralia has the infrastructure to get its deposits up and is an attractive target. ""


	
	As a result of that conversation on returning to his office after his run Mr Hull placed an order to acquire 10,000 Giralia shares at $2.96 at 1.34pm and 5,000 Giralia shares for $2.95 per Giralia share at 1.37pm. Both orders traded between 1.34pm and 2.27pm following amendments of the bid prices. This was the first occasion he had purchased Giralia shares.
	
	
	On 16 December 2010 at 2.29pm he also placed a further order to acquire 5,000 Giralia shares at $2.95 per share. As the bid price entered by him was below the existing market price for Giralia shares the order was not filled. On 17 December 2010 his unfilled order for 5,000 Giralia shares was executed. On the same day he also acquired an additional 20,000 Giralia shares.
	
	
	On 20 December 2010 at 11.25am he acquired a further 10,000 Giralia shares.
	
	
	Between 16 December 2010 and 20 December 2010 he acquired 60,000 Giralia shares for a total consideration of $179,265.27.
	
	
	On 21 December 2010 at 10.15am Giralia and Atlas jointly issued a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive"", entitled ""Recommended Takeover Offer For Giralia by Atlas” (the 21 December Announcement), in which it was stated that Giralia and Atlas had signed a Bid Implementation Agreement for an off-market takeover bid by Atlas for all of the shares in Giralia at an implied offer price of $4.57, which represented a premium of 52.9% to the closing price of Giralia shares on 20 December 2010 and a premium of 53.5% to the 1 month VWAP of Giralia shares to 20 December 2010.
	
	
	When trading in Giralia shares resumed following the 21 December announcement the opening price of Giralia shares was $4.11, representing an increase of $1.18 (or 39.5%) from its closing price of $2.99 on 21 December 2010, the last full day of trading on the ASX prior to the 21 December announcement.
	
	
	Based on the opening price of Giralia following the 21 December announcement Mr Hull's holding in Giralia was valued at $250,200.00 representing a notional gross profit of $70,934.74.
	
	
	On 1 March 2011, as a result of the takeover he received 90,000 Atlas shares in consideration for his 60,000 Giralia shares. On 5 April 2011 he sold 25,000 Atlas shares at $3.87 per share for $96,750, realising a gross profit of $46,954.09 on those shares. The notional gain on the remaining unsold 65,000 Atlas shares was $114,930.64.
	
	
	On 22 December 2011 he acquired a further 10,000 Atlas shares at $2.70 per share. On 18 June 2013 he sold 50,000 Atlas shares at $0.75 per share, realising a substantial loss. As at 10 March 2016 Atlas shares have a share price of $0,025 per share. The remaining 25,000 Atlas shares are presently valued at $625. He made a substantial loss in relation to this trading activity.
	


Count 3 and Section 16BA Schedule: Acquisition of shares in Jabiru Metals Limited


	
	Mr Hull acquired 13 separate parcels of shares in Jabiru Metals Limited. The acquisition of seven of those parcels between 7 January 2011 and 31 January 2011 are the subject of the offence listed on the s 16BA Schedule. The subsequent six acquisitions between 1 February 2011 and 9 February 2011 are the subject of Count three on the Indictment.
	
	
	Jabiru was an Australian resources company whose ordinary fully paid shares traded on the ASX up until 22 June 2011. In or around August 2010 representatives from the IBD of Credit Suisse in Sydney approached Independence Group NL to discuss the possibility of Independence acquiring Jabiru (""the Jabiru Transaction""). On 10 November 2010 Credit Suisse was engaged by Independence to act as its exclusive financial adviser and broker with respect to Independence's proposed acquisition of Jabiru.
	
	
	Shortly after being engaged for the proposed transaction Credit Suisse assigned a deal team to work on the Jabiru Transaction. The Jabiru Transaction was treated confidentially by Credit Suisse and given the code name ""Project Kangaroo"". Information about the Jabiru Transaction was restricted within Credit Suisse to members of the Project Kangaroo deal team.
	
	
	By early December 2010 Mr Thompson had become a member of the Project Kangaroo deal team working on the Jabiru Transaction. From this point and until 9 February 2011 Mr Thompson was involved in discussions with Independence's advisors, and drafting and reviewing formal documentation for the Jabiru Transaction such as a bid implementation agreement, pre-bid terms sheets, draft ASX announcements and drafts of confidentiality agreements between Independence and Jabiru.
	
	
	On 8 December 2010 Mr Hull and Mr Thompson met for a regular lunchtime run. During the course of the run Mr Thompson said words to Mr Hull relating to JML to the following effect:
	


""It's worth a punt on Jabiru.""


	
	On 13 December 2010 at 9.29am Mr Hull entered an order to acquire 40,000 Jabiru securities at $0.55 per share. As the bid price he entered was below the existing market price for Jabiru shares the order remained unfilled.
	
	
	On 20 December 2010 preliminary discussions took place between executives from Independence and Jabiru regarding a potential transaction involving both companies.
	
	
	On 21 December 2010 at 12.36pm he amended the bid price of his existing (unfilled) order to acquire 40,000 Jabiru shares by raising the bid price from $0.55 to $0.59, which was still below the existing market price for Jabiru shares and the order remained unfilled.
	
	
	On 22 December 2010 and 24 December 2010 Mr Hull and Mr Thompson spoke on the telephone for 4 minutes and 6 minutes respectively.
	
	
	On 24 December 2010 confidentiality agreements were signed by Independence and Jabiru, respectively, to allow due diligence on Jabiru.
	
	
	On 7 January 2011 at about 12.45pm Mr Hull met with Mr Thompson for one of their regular lunchtime runs. At 1.38pm, after returning to his office following his run, Mr Hull amended his existing unfilled order to acquire 40,000 Jabiru shares by raising the bid price from $0.59 to $0.655. His order to acquire 40,000 Jabiru shares executed later that day. This was the first occasion he had purchased Jabiru shares.
	
	
	At 1.40pm on 7 January 2011 he placed a further order to acquire 40,000 Jabiru shares at $0.65 per share. The order traded in full later that day. At 2.50pm on 7 January 2011 he entered an order to buy an additional 50,000 Jabiru shares at $0.64 per share. As his bid price was below the existing market price for Jabiru shares the order was not filled. The order traded in full on 10 January 2011.
	
	
	On 11 January 2011 at 11.02am he placed an order to acquire 30,000 Jabiru shares for $0.625. The order traded in full that same day between 11.47am and midday.
	
	
	On 13 January 2011 at 12.29pm he placed an order to acquire a further 60,000 Jabiru shares for $0.645. The order was not filled on this day.
	
	
	On 20 January 2011 at 12.26pm he amended the order he originally placed on 13 January 2011 by increasing the price from $0.645 to $0.65. The order subsequently traded in full a short time later between 12.28pm and 12.29pm.
	
	
	On 21 January 2011 at 10.15am he placed an order to acquire a further 50,000 Jabiru shares at $0.63. The order traded in full on this same day at 11.13am.
	
	
	On 11, 18, 20 and 24 January 2011 Mr Hull and Mr Thompson met for a run at around 12.45pm.
	
	
	On 28 January 2011 they met at their usual time of 12.45 pm for a lunchtime run. Later that day at 3.25pm Mr Hull placed an order to acquire 50,000 Jabiru shares at $0.61 per share. As the bid price was below the existing market price the order did not trade until 31 January 2011.
	
	
	On Tuesday 1 February 2011 at 12.25pm he sent an email to Mr Thompson titled ""Cricket Sunday"" inviting him to participate in a social game of cricket. Mr Thompson responded by email a short time later stating (in reference to the Jabiru Transaction): ""Definitely keen to play - presuming I am not in Perth stitching up this deal"". At 3.06 pm on 1 February 2011, Mr Hull and Mr Thompson had a 6 minute telephone conversation. At 3:25pm Mr Hull placed an order to buy 28,662 Jabiru shares at $0.605 per share. The order was executed later that day.
	
	
	On 2 February 2011 and 4 February 2011 Mr Hull met Mr Thompson for lunchtime runs. After returning to his office following his run on 4 February 2011 Mr Hull made his largest single daily purchase of Jabiru shares when he acquired 150,000 shares in two separate transactions for a total consideration of $98,750. The orders were placed between 1.28pm and 2.09pm.
	
	
	On Sunday 6 February 2011 Mr Thompson and Mr Hull played in a social cricket match.
	
	
	On 7 February 2011 at 6.10am Mr Thompson flew to Perth for the transaction.
	
	
	On 7 February 2011 at 9.11am Mr Hull amended the bid price of his existing unfilled order for 50,000 Jabiru shares (which had been placed at 3:42pm on 4 February 2011) by raising the bid price from $0.65 to $0.655 per Jabiru share. The amended order subsequently traded in full on 7 February 2011.
	
	
	At 10:36am on 7 February 2011 he placed an order to buy an additional 51,338 Jabiru shares.
	
	
	At 9.25am on 8 February 2011 he placed an order to purchase a further 40,000 Jabiru shares at $0.655. Later that day at 1.47pm he amended the order price to $0.66. The order traded in full at 11.18am on 9 February 2011. This was the last order placed by him to acquire Jabiru shares.
	
	
	Between 1.39pm on 7 January 2011 and 9 February 2011 he acquired 640,000 Jabiru shares for a total consideration of $413,073.59.
	
	
	On 9 February 2011 at 5.26pm Jabiru and Independence jointly issued a public ASX announcement, classified as ""price sensitive”, entitled ""Independence Group Announces Recommended Takeover of Jabiru Metals"" (""the 9 February Announcement""), in which it was stated that Jabiru and Independence had signed a Bid Implementation Agreement for an off-market takeover offer by Independence for all of the issued and outstanding shares in Jabiru at an implied offer of A$0.961 per Jabiru share, which represented a 44.5% premium to the closing price of Jabiru shares on 9 February 2011 and a 50.2% premium to the 1 month VWAP of Jabiru shares to 9 February 2011.
	
	
	When trading in Jabiru shares resumed following the 9 February announcement the opening price of Jabiru shares was $0.855, representing an increase of $0.19 (or 29%) from the closing price on the ASX prior to the announcement. Based on the opening price of Jabiru shares following the 9 February Announcement Mr Hull's holding in Jabiru was valued at $547,200, representing an unrealised profit of $134,126.41.
	
	
	On 14 June 2011, as a result of the takeover offer Mr Hull received 80,000 Independence shares in consideration for his Jabiru shares. Between 7 April 2011 and 5 April 2012 he sold 25,000 Independence shares at prices between $4.20 and $6.85 per share for $141,815.87, and realised a gross profit of $12,730.37 on those shares.
	
	
	The value of the remaining unsold 55,000 Independence shares when valued at the closing price of Independence shares on the ASX on 31 March 2011 (date used by Independence to calculate the Jabiru shares for the takeover) was $362,450. The notional gain on this parcel of shares was $78,461.91. The total realised profit and notional gain was $91,192.28.
	
	
	He subsequently bought and sold further parcels of Independence shares. The price of Independence shares on 10 March 2016 was $2.99 per share. If the remaining 55,000 shares relevant to this count were sold at this price, he would realise an overall loss in excess of $100,000.
	


Additional Aspects of Mr Hull's trading


	
	During the period from 27 May 2008 to 3 June 2011 the Hull E*TRADE trading account no. 3722226 held up to 37 different securities in its share portfolio at any one time.
	
	
	During that period two of the top five investments made through that account were Mr Hull's acquisitions of securities in:
	


a.   Jabiru - valued at $413,073.59; and

b.   Giralia - valued at $179,265.27.


	
	The total amount invested by him in Jabiru, Giralia and Mac Services shares referrable to the counts on the indictment was $483,381.56. He invested an additional $203,950.00 in Jabiru in respect of the matter on the s. 16BA schedule.
	
	
	His investment in Jabiru was the largest investment he made in any one stock while his acquisition of Giralia shares was his fourth largest single investment in the period May 2008 to June 2011.
	
	
	On 1 November 2010, prior to acquiring shares in Jabiru and Giralia, he sent an email identifying stocks in the coal, gold and iron ore sectors which were on his watch list. The stocks identified did not include any of the securities which he subsequently went on to acquire on the basis of the information received from Mr Thompson.
	
	
	In each case, possession of the inside information was a significant consideration in Mr Hull's decision to acquire the relevant securities, along with his own research and assessment of the stock.
	
	
	His purchasing of shares in Mac Services, Jabiru and Giralia resulted in a total gross realised profit of $79,086.81 on those shares.
	
	
	Based upon the information given to him by Mr Thompson, the total realised and unrealised profits (excluding subsequent actual or unrealised losses) was approximately $272,479.36.
	


Sentencing considerations


	
	I now deal with the relevant matters to be taken into account for the purposes of s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act.
	


Section 16A(2)(a) and (b) – nature and circumstances of offending and other charges


	
	The circumstances of the offending have been set out earlier. Senior Counsel for Mr Hull argued that the offences should be seen as falling at the lowest end of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. That was because Mr Hull was the tippee rather than the person breaching trust in providing the information, the information provided was vague and unspecific, it could not be said that he knew that the information was inside information as opposed to the position that he ought reasonably have known that it was, that the conduct was opportunistic, that he did not take steps to conceal the transactions and that ultimately he made a significant overall loss in relation to the trading activity.
	
	
	I do not agree. It may be accepted that a person in his position as a tippee should be regarded as less culpable than the person who breaches trust. However, the offending in the present case was systematic and prolonged over a five month period. Whilst what was imparted to him might be relatively non-specific in terms of what would happen in the target companies or to their share price, the information was quite enough in the circumstances of the relationship between Mr Thompson and Mr Hull to give a clear indication to Mr Hull that he ought to act to purchase shares in the named target companies. The timing of the contact between the two men and the purchase of the shares in each case is also significant. Further, the amounts invested totalling a little over $685,000 were considerable. The realised profit of $79,086.81 might have been relatively small but the extent of any profits or losses is governed by matters other than the amount of the investment and is of less significance in determining objective seriousness.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, this was not a one-off use of information which might place the matter in the lowest category of offending. Moreover, Mr Hull’s motivation was financial profit, albeit for himself and his family.
	
	
	I consider the offending is below the mid-range of seriousness but not at the lowest end. In that regard, I take into account the offence constituted by the matters on the s 16BA schedule but I note that there appears to have been a somewhat arbitrary split between the first period in which shares in Jabiru were purchased prior to February 2011 with the balance being the offence of Count 3 of the indictment. I also take into account that the three counts on the indictment and the offence on the s 16BA schedule are all rolled-up offences.
	


Section 16A(2)(d) and (e) – victims and damage


	
	Cases such as R v Hartman [2010] NSWSC 1422; (2010) 81 ACSR 121 at [45] and Kamay v R [2015] VSCA 296 at [45] have stressed that insider trading should not be seen as a victimless crime, and that the integrity of the market is damaged causing loss to other persons.
	


Section 16A(2)(f) – contrition


	
	Although Mr Hull did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing I accept from his guilty pleas, his co-operation with the authorities (dealt with in the next section) and from what I have read in the medical reports and references that he is remorseful for his wrongdoing.
	


Section 16A(2)(g) and (h) – plea and co-operation


	
	Mr Hull was charged by Court Attendance Notices with 67 offences on 9 April 2014. On 12 May 2015 he was committed for trial on 63 of those offences after a contested committal hearing. The matter was first listed in the Arraignments List in this Court on 5 June 2015. After a number of subsequent appearances in the Arraignments List he pleaded guilty on 6 November 2015 to the three counts on the indictment and asked that the matter on the s 16BA schedule be taken into account. The delay from June to November was occasioned by negotiations in relation to the offences. The pleas of guilty are to be taken into account as recognition of his willingness to facilitate the course of justice. In that regard it is appropriate to consider the issue in conjunction with the matter of his co-operation with law enforcement agencies.
	
	
	He was first interviewed by ASIC officers on 3 August 2011. Although there was an initial reluctance to provide a fully frank account of his offending, in a second interview of the afternoon of that day he made a number of admissions including that he had acquired the shares in the three companies, that his friend Mr Thompson who worked in the investing banking team at Credit Suisse communicated to him confidential, price sensitive information in relation to and ahead of those acquisitions, and that he knew that the relevant information provided by Mr Thompson was inside information.
	
	
	On 4 November 2015 he signed an induced statement and entered into an undertaking under s 21E of the Crimes Act that he would give evidence in any future prosecution of Mr Thompson. The evidence of the relevant officer from ASIC was that some of the information provided, particularly that of Mr Thompson’s involvement, was significant and that if Mr Thompson was charged and went to trial Mr Hull would be the only person who could give evidence about the relevant conversations with Mr Thompson. The officer considered further that Mr Hull had made a genuine effort to cooperate fully with ASIC in relation to Mr Thompson, and that he gave full, frank and truthful information in his 2015 interviews. The officer noted that in the 2011 interview Mr Hull made voluntary admissions against interest as to his own involvement. The officer said that absent those admissions ASIC may not have been able to obtain direct admissible evidence to prove Mr Hull’s own offending to the criminal standard. It is clear, therefore, that the co-operation in that regard must be regarded as significant.
	
	
	Further, when proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) were commenced by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police against him, Mr Hull offered to settle the proceedings in a way which was, in substance, accepted by the Commissioner. I have regard, therefore, pursuant to s 320(a) of the Proceeds of Crime Act, to that co-operation.
	
	
	The Crown did not dispute that the plea had been made at the earliest opportunity nor that Mr Hull had made genuine efforts to co-operate fully with ASIC in relation to Mr Thompson.
	
	
	I consider in all the circumstances that a combined discount should be provided of 50% for the plea of guilty and the high order co-operation with law enforcement agencies.
	


Section 16A(2)(j), (ja) and (k) – deterrence and punishment


	
	The Crown correctly submitted that the primary sentencing considerations in the present matter should be general deterrence, denunciation and appropriate punishment. Personal deterrence does not seem to me to be a significant consideration. It seems most unlikely that Mr Hull will ever be in the position to commit similar offences again. Moreover, the absence of any prior offending suggests that the commission of any other type of offending is most unlikely.
	
	
	On the other hand, the significance of general deterrence on white collar offenders and offences of the present type has been stressed in a number of cases including DPP (Cth) v Gregory [2011] 34 VR 1 at [53] and R v Pogson, Lapham & Martin [2012] 91 ACSR 420 at [141]. These and other cases such as Khoo v R [2013] NSWCCA 323 at [78] and [79] have emphasised the need for a clear deterrent that insider traders should expect to go to gaol.
	


Section 16A(2)(m) and (n) – the Offender


	
	Mr Hull was born in South Africa on 28 November 1974. He is a British citizen with Australian residency status. He met his wife in London in 2001. They returned to Australia in 2004 and married in 2005. They have four children aged 10, 8, 4 and 2. His qualifications and work history were noted earlier.
	
	
	By all accounts he was a hardworking man who devoted himself to his family. References from a number of persons attest to his good character and essential decency. That was, for example, exemplified when he attempted to apprehend a person stealing from motor vehicles near the Art Gallery in Sydney. A letter from the Assistant Deputy Commissioner of Field Operations of the NSW Police demonstrates the gratitude the police felt for his actions in that regard.
	
	
	Mr Hull has suffered from depression since 2009. He initially consulted Richard McBride, a clinical psychologist who treated him in conjunction with his general practitioner. He was medicated on anti-depressants for a period of time and underwent a series of consultations with Mr McBride from August 2009 until May 2010. That depression recurred in August 2011 after he was first interviewed by ASIC for these offences and subsequently lost his job.
	
	
	Dr Bruce Westmore provided two differential diagnoses of major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder, the former being in the mild to moderate range.
	
	
	His problems in that regard have not been assisted by his wife’s own psychiatric problems that led to her being twice admitted to hospital and undergoing electroconvulsive therapy after the birth of their fourth child in November 2013.
	
	
	Although Mr Hull told Dr Westmore, in answer to questions about why he committed the offences, that he felt his state of mind (his depression) affected his capacity to make clear decisions or consider the potential impact of his behaviour, I note that he had recovered enough from his depression by the time of the offences that he had both been off his anti-depressant medication and ceased his consultations with Mr McBride some three to four months earlier. Further, since Mr Hull did not give evidence at the sentence proceedings, I cannot place much if any weight on his statement to Dr Westmore in the circumstances. In that regard, the extended period of offending tells against the explanation.
	
	
	Dr Westmore considered that his risk of reoffending was in the lower range. For that reason, for the reason of the remorse he has shown, and for the fact that he is unlikely ever to be in a similar position again, I consider that his prospects of rehabilitation are high.
	


Section 16A(2)(p) – effect of sentence on the family


	
	Before hardship on an offender’s family can be considered to be a mitigating factor exceptional circumstances must be shown: Markovic v The Queen [2010] VSCA 105; (2010) 200 A Crim R 510 at [11] and [18]. The view of Beech-Jones J in R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 at [109]-[118] urged upon me by Senior Counsel for Mr Hull must be regarded as a minority view.
	
	
	Two matters, considered together, seem to me to provide exceptional circumstances in the present matter. The first is the mental health of Mrs Hull and issues concerning her parents. The second concerns Mr Hull’s status in Australia as a person lacking Australian citizenship.
	
	
	As to the first matter, I have read a report from Dr Nicholas Di Ciaccio who has been Mrs Hull’s treating psychiatrist since March 2014. He noted that her depressive illness began shortly after the commencement of the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against her husband in June 2013. Her condition worsened and peaked in the two months following May 2014 when he was charged. At that time she became extremely stressed, suicidal, infanticidal and required two consecutive hospitalisations and a course of electroconvulsive therapy. Dr Ciaccio said that the factors that contributed to her fragility, which she still has, are both constitutional as well as situational. She has a strong family history of mental illness. A concomitant problem was an extremely debilitating stroke suffered by her father a short time after Mr Hull was first interviewed.
	
	
	Dr Ciaccio concluded in this way:
	


I believe that without the emotional and practical support from her husband Mrs Hull would probably not have maintained her recovery following her serious mental illness. I also think that she very much continues to need her husband’s on the ground support in order to continue to function normally. The removal of this support very much increases the probability of Mrs Hull developing overwhelming anxiety and precipitating another debilitating depressive illness.


	
	Mrs Hull has very limited other support from family or friends. Her father died on 14 May and the funeral was held two weeks ago. Mrs Hull is, naturally enough, grief-stricken. She says, in an affidavit put forward two weeks ago, that she is terrified of losing her husband as well. In addition, medical evidence put forward for the first time two weeks ago, indicates that her mother needs surgery to have both her hips replaced. The first of these will be done in June 2016 and after a rehabilitation period of about six weeks the other hip will be replaced. This means that Mrs Hull’s mother will not be in a position to assist Mrs Hull with the children for some time to come.
	
	
	As unfortunate as the timing of these events is, those circumstances alone would not, in my opinion, have constituted exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	As to the second matter, as noted, Mr Hull was born in South Africa. He has both British and South African citizenship. He is a permanent resident of Australia and possesses a Class BB, Sub-class 155 resident visa. Mrs Hull is an Australian citizen and holds no other citizenship. The four children are Australian born and hold only Australian citizenship.
	
	
	Section 501 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides:
	


501   Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds

Decision of Minister or delegate - natural justice applies

(1)   The Minister may refuse to grant a visa to a person if the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.

Note:          Character test is defined by subsection (6).

(2)   The Minister may cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if:

(a)   the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and

            (b)   the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test.

Decision of Minister - natural justice does not apply

(3)  The Minister may:

(a)   refuse to grant a visa to a person; or

            (b)   cancel a visa that has been granted to a person;

if:

(c)   the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test; and

            (d)   the Minister is satisfied that the refusal or cancellation is in the national interest.

(3A)   The Minister must cancel a visa that has been granted to a person if:

(a)   the Minister is satisfied that the person does not pass the character test because of the operation of:

(i)   paragraph (6)(a) (substantial criminal record), on the basis of paragraph (7)(a), (b) or (c); or

                        (ii)   paragraph (6)(e) (sexually based offences involving a child); and

(b)   the person is serving a sentence of imprisonment, on a full‑time basis in a custodial institution, for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory.

…

Character test

(6)   For the purposes of this section, a person does not pass the character test if:

(a)   the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or

…

(7)   For the purposes of the character test, a person has a substantial criminal record if:

(a)   the person has been sentenced to death; or

(b)   the person has been sentenced to imprisonment for life; or

(c)   the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or

(d)   the person has been sentenced to 2 or more terms of imprisonment, where the total of those terms is 12 months or more; or

(e)   the person has been acquitted of an offence on the grounds of unsoundness of mind or insanity, and as a result the person has been detained in a facility or institution; or

(f)   the person has:

            (i)   been found by a court to not be fit to plead, in relation to an offence; and

            (ii)   the court has nonetheless found that on the evidence available the person committed the offence; and

            (iii)   as a result, the person has been detained in a facility or institution.

Concurrent sentences

(7A)   For the purposes of the character test, if a person has been sentenced to 2 or more terms of imprisonment to be served concurrently (whether in whole or in part), the whole of each term is to be counted in working out the total of the terms.

Example:   A person is sentenced to 2 terms of 3 months imprisonment for 2 offences, to be served concurrently. For the purposes of the  character test, the total of those terms is 6 months.


	
	The effect of those provisions is that if on any single offence Mr Hull is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more the Minister must cancel his visa. Thereafter, under s 501CA of the Act the Minister may revoke the decision to cancel the visa. However, a decision not to exercise the power to cancel a revocation by the Minister is not reviewable. Once Mr Hull becomes an unlawful non-citizen he must be placed in immigration detention until he is granted a visa, deported, or removed from Australia.
	
	
	The situation would be, therefore, that Mr Hull is liable to be removed from his family and eventually this country. Even if Mrs Hull and the children were able to move to Britain or South Africa to be with him there can be no doubt that the effect of that on them would be an exceedingly heavy burden. None of them has known other than life in Australia and Mrs Hull’s family all reside here, most in close proximity to her. As mentioned earlier, Mrs Hull’s father has recently died. Mrs Hull’s desire to support her mother would provide a further reason why moving the family overseas would be emotionally very difficult.
	
	
	The precise effect on sentencing of offenders who might fall within the provisions of s 501(3A) is unclear. It is not necessary to examine the debate contained in a number of judgments of the Victorian and Queensland Courts of Appeal. What is clear, and I take into account, is that the prospect of deportation is a proper matter for consideration, as well as the certainty of cancellation of Mr Hull’s present visa, whatever may subsequently happen concerning his status in Australia.
	
	
	In my opinion, such cancellation and prospect of deportation is such a significant matter when taken in conjunction with Mrs Hull’s fragile mental health state and her family situation that Mr Hull demonstrates that the effect on his family of a sentence that brought about that result amounts to exceptional circumstances.
	


Delay


	
	The authorities are clear that significant delay in concluding the proceedings may result in a substantial discount on the sentence even where the fault lies with an offender. Nothing in the present case suggests that any fault lies with Mr Hull for the delay.
	
	
	The time line is briefly this. Mr Hull was first interviewed on 3 August 2011 when, as noted, he made a number of admissions about the offending. ASIC continued to investigate the matter from that time until 20 December 2012 when a brief was sent to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. It was not until 9 April 2014 that Court Attendance Notices were issued to him for 67 offences. The committal took place on 12 May 2015. He pleaded guilty on 6 November 2015 to the three offences on the indictment and asked for the offence now on the s 16BA schedule to be taken into account. The matter was fixed for sentencing proceedings before me on 7 March 2016 but was adjourned on Mr Hull’s application for ten days to 17 March. At the present date almost five years have elapsed. Where that delay has resulted in significant stress for an offender or left him to a significant degree in uncertain suspense, the delay will be a mitigating factor on sentence: Sabra v R [2015] NSWCCA 38 at [37] adopting what had been said in R v Scook [2008] WASCA 114 at [57] to [65].
	
	
	Whilst it may be accepted that investigation of the types of offences charged here might have some complexity the delay was nevertheless considerable. The evidence from Dr Westmore, and from Mrs Hull at the sentence proceedings, together with what is contained in some of the references provided, together point to the level of stress caused by the delay and uncertainty. The matter has been exacerbated by the issue of his being deported hanging over him and his family.
	


Appropriate sentence


	
	Section 17A of the Crimes Act requires me to consider all other available sentences before I can be satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment should be imposed. Senior Counsel for Mr Hull submitted that the case was appropriate for either a suspended sentence, a community service order or a referral for an Intensive Correction Order. That was put on the basis of a very low level of culpability and the strong subjective case.
	
	
	I have already determined that the objective seriousness of this matter is not at the lowest level principally because it was an extended course of conduct involving the investment of large amounts throughout that period in three different companies. Further, the charges were effectively rolled up charges involving a large number of transactions. The use of rolled up charges is a matter of considerable advantage to an offender: R v Jones [2004] VSCA 68 at [13]; R v Richard [2011] NSWSC 866 at [65].
	
	
	I consider particularly in the light of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Khoo v The Queen and R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 that there is no alternative to a period of imprisonment as the appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this offending. Although I have found that the combination of the family’s circumstances when coupled with the prospect of deportation amounts to exceptional circumstances, the consideration of the effect of a sentence on the family is only one of a number of matters to be taken into account. When the offending otherwise requires a period of fulltime custody, as I have found, the finding of exceptional circumstances cannot override that determination although it may, as it does here, influence the length of the sentence. In fixing the periods of imprisonment for each offence I have had regard to the 50% discount for the pleas and assistance and to the considerable delay involved in these matters coming to the Court for sentence. I have also had particular regard to the effect of the provisions of the Migration Act on Mr Hull and his family. There must be a measure of accumulation in respect of the three counts because each involved separate criminality albeit arising from a similar course of conduct.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 16AC of the Crimes Act I indicate that the sentences I would have imposed but for the reduction for co-operation with law enforcement agencies are these: Count 1 – imprisonment for 8 months; Count 2 – imprisonment for 14 months; Count 3 taking into account the matter on the S 16BA schedule – imprisonment for 15 months.
	
	
	Michael William Hull,
	


(a)   in respect of Count 1 on the indictment I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of six months commencing 3 June 2016 and expiring 2 December 2016;

(b)   in respect of Count 2 I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of ten months commencing 3 September 2016 and expiring 2 July 2017;

(c)   in respect of Count 3 and taking into account the offence on the s 16BA schedule I sentence you to a period of eleven months commencing 3 December 2016 and expiring 2 November 2017.

(d)   I order that you be released after serving a period of seven months imprisonment upon giving security by way of recognisance in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months commencing on 2 January 2017.

2701507,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Vo [2016] NSWSC 711,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the plaintiff) commenced these proceedings by summons filed on 28 June 2013 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth). Except where otherwise indicated, all references to legislative provisions in these reasons are to this Act.
	
	
	On 5 August 2013 this Court made restraining orders over a sum of cash and a property at 11 Donovan Street, Lalor in the State of Victoria (the Property) pursuant to s 19. The orders made provision for the mortgagee, Bankwest (formerly Commonwealth Bank of Australia), to deal with the registered mortgage over the Property in accordance with its terms. The Court also ordered that Thi Thuy Linh Vo, the defendant, be examined pursuant to s 180.
	
	
	By notice of motion filed on 25 May 2015, Ms Vo seeks the following orders:
	


1.   Pursuant to sections 77 and 78 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (“the Act”):

1.1   A declaration that a proportion of the value of the Defendant’s interest in item 2 in the Schedule to the Order of the Court made on 27 August 2013 (“the Donovan Street Property”) was not derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from the commission of any offence; and

1.2   An order directing the Commonwealth, once the Donovan Street Property has vested absolutely in the Commonwealth, to pay to the Defendant an amount to be calculated by the Court in accordance with section 77(2) of the Act.


	
	Since these proceedings were commenced, Bankwest obtained default judgment for possession in respect of the Property on 18 September 2015. A writ of possession issued on 4 November 2015. The Property was sold at auction for $550,000. Settlement occurred on 20 May 2016. The surplus sale proceeds were $99,000.66 and were paid to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, in accordance with the Court’s orders. This is the sum in respect of which the compensation order is sought.
	


The facts

The purchase of the Property


	
	On 29 April 2011 Ms Vo applied for a loan from Bankwest to purchase the Property. She made a written declaration in support of her loan application, in which she made the following three representations (each of which has been established to be false to her knowledge):
	



	
	she worked full time as a “Supervisor Accounting Clerk” at Schembri Earthmoving Repairs for a salary of $74,989.20 and had been employed there for two years;
	
	
	her assets included savings of $86,000 at “WBC” (Westpac Banking Corporation) and $52,000 (which was the deposit she had paid for the purchase of the Property);
	
	
	she intended to rent out the Property for an expected rental income of $15,600.
	



	
	In support of representation (1), Ms Vo provided two documents which appeared to be pay slips from Schembri Earthmoving Repairs. They were expressed to be for the respective periods: 28 March 2011 to 1 April 2011; and 4 April 2011 to 8 April 2011. The hourly rate was expressed to be $37.95/hour, for 38 hours a week. Figures for gross pay, PAYG withholding, net pay, superannuation and sick leave were expressed for “this pay” and “YTD” (year to date). On the second of the two payslips, which was endorsed with the company seal of Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd, the following calculation appeared in bold:
	


$1,442.10 x 52 = $74,989.20.


	
	Of the “assets” referred to in (2), the sum of $132,000 represented a liability to Mrs Schembri who had advanced the money to Ms Vo.
	
	
	As to the “rental income” in (3), Ms Vo admitted that she intended to live at the Property with her three children.
	
	
	In reliance on these representations Bankwest advanced Ms Vo the sum of $495,930.17 so that she could purchase the Property from Oaklake Investments Pty Ltd for $520,000.
	
	
	On 9 May 2011 Ms Vo became the sole registered proprietor of the Property. Bankwest was registered as mortgagee over the Property to secure the loan referred to above.

	The records of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) show that TLC Contractors Pty Ltd was registered on 28 August 2009. Ms Vo was its sole director, secretary and shareholder.
	
	
	On 1 July 2009 LPTP Clothing Pty Ltd opened an account in respect of Ms Vo and deposited $225.69 into an account in the MLCS Superannuation Trust.
	


Schembri Earthmoving Repairs


	
	The plaintiff obtained documents from the ATO and ASIC which establish the following:
	



	
	the business of Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd, which was established on 4 February 1999, is operated by the Schembri Family Trust;
	
	
	Mrs Schembri and her husband Jason Schembri are beneficiaries of the Schembri Family Trust and receive distributions from the trust from time to time;
	
	
	since the time of the registration of Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd on 4 February 1989, Mr Schembri has been its sole director, shareholder and secretary;
	
	
	Mr and Mrs Schembri declared their income (which comprised distributions from the Schembri Family Trust) in their tax returns as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Financial year
			
			
			Mrs Schembri
			
			
			Mr Schembri

			$48,851
			
		
	



	
	Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd did not lodge any tax returns for the 2008-2011 financial years.
	



	
	Ms Vo called Phillip Borg, the accountant for Mr and Mrs Schembri, to give evidence. He deposed in his affidavit that he prepared the tax returns for the Schembri Family Trust, which he identified as the relevant trading entity. He gave evidence that between 2008 and 2011 Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd did not file tax returns because it does not trade in its own right. He confirmed in cross-examination that Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd did not employ anyone and had neither financial outgoings nor income during the period 2008 to 2011.
	


Credit licence


	
	The evidence reveals that neither Ms Vo nor Hui Schembri has ever held a credit licence. A credit licence is required before a person is entitled to lend money. Section 29(2) of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (NSW) provides that it is an offence to lend money without a licence. The plaintiff relied on the circumstance that Mrs Schembri did not have a credit licence for the purposes of the question whether Ms Vo had discharged the onus of proving the matters in s 77(1)(c) and (d) of the Act.
	


Credibility of witnesses

Ms Vo’s evidence


	
	Ms Vo’s evidence is not consistent. Because of the importance of her credibility in the present proceedings I propose to address the various statements she has made over time in the order in which she made them.
	


Ms Vo’s statement dated 19 February 2013


	
	In her statement of 19 February 2013 Ms Vo said, relevantly:
	


3.   I worked in a number of factories for many years. In 2009 I started my own sewing business. I own my own house.

4.   I have been a gambler for many years now. I normally gamble at Crown Casino in Melbourne Treasury Casino in Brisbane, and Sky City Casino in Adelaide Casino.

5.   I am in the process of getting my Turnover documents from these Casinos. I have won more than $1million over the past 3 years.

6.   On 16 February 2013 I was flying from Melbourne to Sydney. I had intended to gamble at the Star City Casino. I normally take a large amount of cash money with me when I gamble. When I win, I take money in the form of cheques as well as cash. But I normally prefer to get cash as it’s quicker.

7.   When I take money in the form of cheques [sic]. I bank the cheque into my CBA account [number provided].

The examination of Ms Vo pursuant to s 180 of the Act


	
	On 21 November 2013 and 12 December 2013 Ms Vo was examined (pursuant to the order referred to above which was made on 5 August 2013) (the 2013 Examination). She was asked about the payslips she submitted in support of her application to Bankwest. The transcript for 19 December 2013 records the following:
	


MR McCARTHY:   Now, you submitted this application to Bankwest to get a mortgage, didn’t you?

INTERPRETER:   Yes

MR McCARTHY:   You were never employed with Schembri Earthmoving Repairs, were you?

INTERPRETER:   No, I did not work there.

MR McCARTHY:   So how did you get payslips in your ---

INTERPRETER:   Yes. At that time I needed a loan to buy an accommodation. I use my business. I try two different banks but this was not – they all rejected that, so I needed somebody to help me with that so I used Schembri Earthmoving Repairs to do this paper for me so that I could get a loan with the bank.

MR McCARTHY:   So you asked Schembri Earthmoving Repairs to give you the payslip?

INTERPRETER:   Yes.

MR McCARTHY:   Even though you were not employed there and you never received any payments from that company?

INTERPRETER:   Yes, I just ask them to do a paper.

MR McCARTHY:   And your purpose in asking for this payslip was so that you could get a loan?

INTERPRETER:   Yes.

MR McCARTHY:   So you accept that it was false to say that you worked at Schembri Earthmoving Repairs?

INTERPRETER:   Yes. I did use my business to – across many banks but they all rejected that because my business was very young, so I needed to do this, ask Schembri to help me so that I could have a home loan.

MR McCARTHY:   Who did you ask in Schembri Earthmoving Repairs for this?

INTERPRETER:   Hu Schembri.

MR McCARTHY:   And was she the person who gave you these?

INTERPRETER:   Yes.

Mr McCARTHY:   And did you tell her why you wanted them?

INTERPRETER:   Yes, I did.


	
	The transcript of the examination also records the following exchange about Ms Vo’s money-lending business:
	


Mr McCARTHY:   And is it part – have you been requested to give that money back to Ms Schembri?

INTERPRETER:   I did offer to pay back but she said, “No, keep the money there,” because she and I agree – took part into our business lending money to others to earn interest and we can share the interest with each other.

Mr McCARTHY:   So you were – if I understand, you were in business with Ms Schembri lending money?

INTERPRETER:   Normally everyone would know that I am a gambling person. I have money. So they just gave me the money, or if I can use the money to earn interest, I can share the interest with people who gave me money.

Ms Vo’s affidavits sworn 27 March 2014, 16 December 2015 and 2 May 2016


	
	Ms Vo’s native language is Vietnamese. She speaks some English but, at times, requires the assistance of an interpreter, both with speaking and reading English. Her affidavit sworn 27 March 2014 bore an endorsement pursuant to s 27A of the Oaths Act 1900 (NSW) but it had not been completed. Section 27A provides:
	


Affidavits by persons unable to read written English

If it appears to the person before whom an affidavit is made (the authorised person) that the person making the affidavit (the deponent) is blind, illiterate or otherwise unable to read written English, the authorised person must certify, in or below the jurat:

(a) that the affidavit was read to the deponent in the presence of the authorised person, and

(b) that it appeared to the authorised person that the deponent understood the affidavit, and

(c) that the deponent subscribed the affidavit (by signature or mark) in the presence of the authorised person.


	
	Ms Vo’s second and third affidavits, dated 16 December 2015 and 2 May 2016 respectively, did not bear the required endorsement.
	
	
	Ms Vo gave oral evidence that before she swore the affidavits her solicitor, Tran Minh Phuoc, who is bilingual in English and Vietnamese, translated the affidavits into Vietnamese for her. She also gave evidence that, on the day of the hearing, 24 May 2016, this process of translation was repeated following which she confirmed that she adhered to what was written in English in her affidavits, with a minor correction to her second affidavit to change the word “week” in paragraph 9 to “month”.
	
	
	In her first affidavit, Ms Vo relevantly deposed (as to her occupation and the loan):
	


“I have worked consistently in a number of factories for many years. I did process work mainly.

I also started and operated a number of businesses for many years. I owned and operated a beauty salon Ninh Kieu for some 3 years. I also owned and operated a sewing business called TLC Contractors Pty Ltd.

In May 2011, I used some of the money from my savings to buy my own home at 11 Donovan Street, LALOR, VICTORIA. The purchase price was $520,000. I borrowed $408,408 from BankWest Home Loans. I also borrowed $130,000 from my friend Hieu Thi SCHEMBRI to pay the deposit. Annexed and marked “A” is a copy of the “Letter of Confirmation” signed by myself and Hieu Thi SCHEMBRI.”


	
	In her first affidavit Ms Vo also deposed to her money-lending business:
	


“I am in the business of loaning money to people and receiving a high interest in return. I would obtain money from my close friends and family and then loan this money to close friends. I trusted at the casinos who were in need of money to gamble. I would charge them a high interest rate and they would pay me back. I would then repay the principal and some of the interest to the original persons who gave me the money.”


	
	In her second affidavit Ms Vo relevantly deposed:
	


“10.   Hieu [Schembri] told me that I was paying too much rent, and that she would lend me some money to buy a house.

11.   Hieu told me that she got the $130,000.00 to loan me by drawing down on the equity from her home loan account. As a result, Hieu had to pay interest plus the principal back to the bank.

12.   The $130,000.00 borrowed from Hieu was put into my Westpac bank account – Account No. XXXX.

…

14.   Hieu and I made an informal lending agreement that went like this:

a.   Hieu would lend me $130,000.00 for a deposit to buy the property;

b.   I would pay Hieu the interest on this loan, at about $200-$400.00 per time. This would be paid immediately and in cash; and

c.   If the house was ever sold, I would pay off the mortgage to the bank, pay Hieu back the $130,000.00 and then split the capital gain equally with Hieu.”


	
	In her third affidavit Ms Vo deposed as to the break-up of the $130,000 which she had borrowed from Mrs Schembri to buy the Property and the dates on which each amount was paid.
	


Ms Vo’s oral evidence at the hearing on 24 May 2016


	
	An issue as to the quality of the interpreter was raised in the course of Ms Vo’s cross-examination by Ms Dobraszczyk, who appeared on behalf of Ms Vo. Ms Dobraszczyk informed me that her instructing solicitor, who is bilingual in the English and Vietnamese languages, had raised the concern. Following the raising of the issue, Ms Vo was invited to answer the questions posed in English, if possible. However, it was made clear to her that she would have the assistance of the interpreter, if required. Following a short adjournment granted for that purpose, Ms Dobraszczyk confirmed her instructions to continue with the same interpreter. After the luncheon adjournment, another interpreter took over, about whom no complaint was made. I am satisfied, in these circumstances, that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that Ms Vo understood what was being put to her, and that any inconsistencies in her evidence were not the product of issues associated with the standard of interpreting.
	
	
	In her evidence, Ms Vo described her occupation as a beautician. She admitted that she was not working as a beautician, although said that she had done so in the past. She said that she had done a beautician course for one year in about 1992 or 1993. She could not remember the name of the institution that had run the course; the names of any of the teachers; or the names of any of her fellow students. She agreed that she had not worked as a beautician for about 20 years.
	
	
	Ms Vo confirmed the accuracy of the ATO’s records set out above as to her income and the names of her employers. She said that she had three children, who were born in 1994, 1996 and 2002 respectively, whom she supports financially.
	
	
	Ms Vo confirmed that she had known Mrs Schembri for about ten years, in the course of which they developed a close friendship. She said that she speaks to Mrs Schembri every day and spoke to her most recently on the previous day (23 May 2016).
	
	
	Ms Vo agreed that, in 2011, when she decided that she wanted to buy the Property, she had “next to nothing” by the way of assets or income. She realised that, in order to have her loan application with Bankwest approved, she would have to give false information about her financial position. Ms Vo did not, however, agree that the picture of her financial position which she painted for Bankwest was entirely false and maintained that she had in fact worked for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd for “three months to get some income” in 2011. The evidence she had given in the 2013 Examination (that she had not worked for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs Pty Ltd) was put to her in cross-examination. She insisted that she had worked for Mrs Schembri for a few months in 2011.
	
	
	The following exchange ensued in her cross-examination:
	


Q. It [the paperwork provided to Bankwest] was false because you never did any work in relation to those pay slips. Correct?

A. WITNESS: No, I did some ‑ I did come to work with her but ‑ but ‑ but not ‑ not payment. I just come every day. Sometimes I work myself and sometimes I have the time, I come to help her, just to help. Because she and me like sister. I come help to her but not payment. That's right. Just do the paper to borrow the bank.


	
	Mr O’Mahoney, who appeared for the plaintiff, then put to Ms Vo the actual payslips submitted to Bankwest. Ms Vo agreed that they gave an entirely false impression and that she had never received any payments from Schembri Earthmoving Repairs. Ms Vo admitted that she had asked Mrs Schembri to prepare the payslips for her and that she had explained why she needed them. Ms Vo admitted that she had made false representations to Bankwest in order to obtain the loan. She explained why she had done so in the following answer:
	


A. WITNESS: I know it ‑ I know I done this wrong. I done this wrong because my low income, I can't borrow the bank. That's why I done this paper wrong to ‑ because I want to borrow the money. That's why I do this. Not true, yeah, I know it wrong, yeah.


	
	Ms Vo admitted that she had made the following representations that were false to her knowledge in the loan application: that she was employed by Schembri Earthmoving Repairs; that her occupation was supervisor accounting clerk; that she had been employed there for two years; that her annual income was $74,989.20; that she intended to rent out the Property for $15,600 per annum (when the fact was that she intended to live there with her three children); that she had no dependants (when she actually had three dependent children); that she had assets which included savings of $86,000; and that she had paid the deposit of $52,000 from her own money.
	
	
	Ms Vo explained the work she was to do for Mrs Schembri in the following terms:
	


A. WITNESS: Sometime I come in. I come to help her when she sick or something. I come to cook, clean and help everything. I can do everything and as only for work over there, just I didn't work much, only to ‑ after do the paper, just write ""yes, I work for you, Schembri"". I still have her come because she's very sick, to cook for her, to clean, to do everything, to help her just like sister, like my family.

Q. I understand?

A. WITNESS: And I'm not work in the business, just do the laundry and do the lawn.


	
	Ms Vo admitted in cross-examination that Bankwest approved her loan only because of the false representations she had made about her income and savings. She admitted that what she had falsely represented in the loan application to be savings were in fact monies (totalling $130,000) which Mrs Schembri had transferred to her account for that purpose.
	


Findings regarding Ms Vo’s credibility


	
	As is apparent from what is set out above, Ms Vo’s evidence was, at times, inconsistent. The inconsistency between her evidence in the 2013 Examination that she had not worked for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs and her evidence before me that she had performed some work in the business, albeit of a menial and occasional kind, was never resolved. She was particularly evasive about her occupation and did not explain why she had described herself as a beautician when she had worked in that area for a short period about twenty years ago. She provided no documentary support for any of her statements about her gambling winnings or the income she had earned from her work from time to time.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the matters referred to above, Ms Vo was prepared to make substantial admissions, including that: she had intentionally misrepresented her income and savings to Bankwest for the purpose of obtaining a loan; that she had asked Mrs Schembri to prepare fake payslips for her to give the impression that she had a regular and substantial income in secure employment; and that she had asked Mrs Schembri to transfer funds to her bank account in order to give Bankwest the false impression that she had substantial savings.
	
	
	As to the somewhat vexed question whether she ever actually worked for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs, I am not satisfied that Ms Vo actually received any payment for work in that business. Whatever she did for Mrs Schembri appears to have been no more than sisterly acts of assistance by way of household help. To the extent to which Mrs Schembri paid Ms Vo any money I am not persuaded that these sums were other than gifts to assist her with her maintenance and support and that of her children.
	


Mrs Schembri’s evidence


	
	Mrs Schembri affirmed three affidavits, on 14 May 2015, 16 December 2015 and 2 May 2016 respectively. They suffered from the same defect as those of Ms Vo in that they did not bear an endorsement under s 27A of the Oaths Act. However, I was satisfied that Mrs Schembri understood the contents of her affidavits as they had been translated for her by Ms Vo’s bilingual solicitor, Ms Phuoc, before she affirmed them. Further, the court interpreter also translated them for her before she gave oral evidence in Court on 24 May 2015, following which she adhered to their contents, save for one matter. Mrs Schembri took issue with the description of her occupation as “retired” and said, in further evidence in chief, that she was helping her husband with his business.
	
	
	Mrs Schembri deposed as follows in her affidavit of 14 May 2015:
	


1.   I have known the Defendant for approximately 15 years. I am her adopted sister. Her mother adopted me when I was 34 years old.

2   On 8 April 2011, I lent the Defendant $130,000.00 for the purpose of purchasing property at 11 Donovan Street, Lalor, Victoria 3075, pursuant to the Contract of Sale dated 22 March 2011 and settlement due on 4 May 2011 in the price of $520,000. Annexed and marked “A” is a copy of the “Letter of Confirmation” signed by myself and the Defendant.

3   On 23 March and 11 April 2011, I transferred the amount of $130,000 – in instalments of $45,000 and $85,000 – from the equity in my home mortgage account into the mortgage account of the above property that the Defendant was purchasing. Annexed and marked “B” is a copy of the relevant bank account statement.

4   The Defendant agreed to pay me back once she sold the above property for a profit in the future.


	
	Mrs Schembri admitted that she knew that Ms Vo wanted to buy the Property and needed a bank loan to do so. She admitted that the payslips were “entirely fake” since Ms Vo did not earn those amounts. Mrs Schembri said that, in so far as Ms Vo did any work for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs, it was looking after the shop when Mrs Schembri was away or doing some cleaning on the premises. From time to time Mrs Schembri would give Ms Vo money to help her support the children.
	
	
	Mrs Schembri’s evidence about the provenance of the $130,000 was relatively scant. She annexed the Westpac bank statement which recorded the withdrawals of the constituent sums but gave inconsistent evidence about her own income and occupation. In her affidavits, she stated that her occupation was “retired” but she said in evidence that she performed work for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs, which she implied was an entity engaging in profitable commercial enterprise. However, when she was challenged by reference to the evidence given by Mr Borg (referred to above, that Schembri Earthmoving Repairs had never traded), she said that there was actually another entity, “JMV”, which worked alongside Schembri Earthmoving Repairs and that JMV was the entity for which she performed work.
	
	
	Mrs Schembri said that she last spoke to Ms Vo about two weeks ago (which was inconsistent with Ms Vo’s evidence that they had spoken on the previous day).
	
	
	Mrs Schembri’s evidence was largely against interest and, to that extent, I accept it. She was evasive about whether Ms Vo worked for Schembri Earthmoving Repairs and contradictory in her evidence about whether she herself worked at all and for whom she worked. I have set out my findings above as to that matter.

	The provisions relied on by the plaintiff are the following:
	


82   Obtaining financial advantage by deception 

(1)   A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or another any financial advantage is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to level 5 imprisonment (10 years maximum).

(2) For purposes of this section deception has the same meaning as in section 81.

81   Obtaining property by deception 

. . .

(4) For the purposes of this section, ""deception""—

(a) means any deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or any other person;

Criminal Code (Schedule 1 to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth))


	
	Section 400.9 of the Criminal Code relevantly provides:
	


400.9 Dealing with property reasonably suspected of being proceeds of crime etc. 

(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and

(b) it is reasonable to suspect that the money or property is proceeds of crime; and

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $100,000 or more.

Consideration


	
	It is common ground that the requirements of s 77(1)(a) and (b) of the Act were met, since Ms Vo has made an application for a compensation order and she has an interest in the Property, as registered proprietor, and an interest in the surplus proceeds as a result of its sale. Section 77(1)(c) and (d) are in issue. In order to obtain a compensation order, Ms Vo must establish that the balance of the surplus proceeds of sale of the Property was not derived or realised, directly or indirectly, from the commission of any offence and that her interest is not the instrument of any offence. These matters will be considered in turn.
	


Section 77(1)(c): whether Ms Vo has established that any proportion of the value of her interest was not derived, or realised, directly or indirectly, from the commission of any offence

The parties’ submissions

Ms Vo’s submissions in chief


	
	Ms Dobraszczyk submitted that the plaintiff was required to identify the offence or offences, the commission of which were said to have resulted in the proportion of the value of Ms Vo’s interest, in respect of which Ms Vo claimed a compensation order. She submitted that the plaintiff had failed to identify any such offence or offences.
	
	
	Ms Dobraszczyk submitted that Ms Vo had discharged the onus imposed on her by s 77(1)(c) by showing that the monies advanced by Mrs Schembri had been advanced from a home loan account at Westpac in the names of Mrs Schembri and her husband.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Mr O’Mahoney submitted that to require the plaintiff to nominate the offence or offences from which Ms Vo’s interest in the Property was said to be derived would be to reverse the onus of proof and disregard the statutory wording.
	
	
	The plaintiff submitted that, but for the commission of the offence of obtaining financial advantage by deception, Ms Vo would not have acquired the Property at all. In these circumstances, Mr O’Mahoney contended that Ms Vo could not discharge her onus of establishing that any proportion of the value of her interest was not derived, or realised, directly or indirectly, from the commission of any offence.
	
	
	Mr O’Mahoney confirmed that the plaintiff relied on the admissions made by Ms Vo that she engaged in the business of money lending and the evidence that she was not licensed. He submitted that these admissions could be taken into account in deciding whether Ms Vo had discharged the onus under s 77(1)(c).
	
	
	Mr O’Mahoney submitted further that there was no objective evidence as to how the monies which were advanced by Mrs Schembri came into Mrs Schembri’s possession. He pointed to the absence of any tax records, financial statements or other business records for the relevant time which indicated what Mrs Schembri did for a living, what she owned, what income she earned and what tax was paid on it. He submitted that the absence of such documents was telling in itself in light of the unreliability of her oral evidence. He referred to her inconsistent evidence about whether she was retired or not, employed or not, and by whom, if at all, she was employed.
	
	
	Mr O’Mahoney also relied on the circumstance that Mrs Schembri was central to the fraud perpetrated by Ms Vo on Bankwest in that she falsified the payslips which gave unwarranted verisimilitude to Ms Vo’s false representations to Bankwest that she earned income from Schembri Earthmoving Repairs (at the level and for the period indicated in the payslips). She also advanced the monies which permitted Ms Vo to represent (falsely) the amount of the loan from Mrs Schembri as an asset (savings and the deposit) rather than as a liability (which was its true character). In these circumstances, Mrs Schembri was not an arm’s length-third party lender to Ms Vo but a substantial collaborator in the deception.
	


Ms Vo’s submissions in reply


	
	To the extent to which the plaintiff relied on the circumstance that neither Ms Vo nor Mrs Schembri had a credit licence, Ms Dobraszczyk contended that the plaintiff ought not be permitted to make submissions, since neither Mrs Schembri nor Ms Vo had been cross-examined about their evidence of money-lending or any unauthorised lending in which they had engaged. She submitted that, in these circumstances, the plaintiff was not entitled to rely on Ms Vo’s admissions that they were involved in a money-lending business.
	
	
	In response to Mr O’Mahoney’s submission that there were no business records to substantiate Mrs Schembri’s income, Ms Dobraszczyk asked rhetorically, “what is so magical about the documents he has submitted have to be there?”
	


Consideration


	
	I do not understand it to be in issue that the loan was obtained from Bankwest as a result of representations made to the bank, which were false to Ms Vo’s knowledge at the time she made them. Indeed Ms Vo made specific admissions to that effect. In these circumstances, I cannot be satisfied that the Property was not purchased as the result of the commission of an offence contrary to s 400.9 of the Criminal Code, the offence being obtaining a financial advantage (a loan from Bankwest) by deception contrary to s 82 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic).
	
	
	As Ms Vo bore the onus of proof, she would have had to exclude the possibility that the monies were obtained in connection with an illegal money-lending business. For present purposes, Ms Vo was a borrower, and not a lender. In these circumstances the legality or otherwise of her own money-lending business may not have been relevant. Nonetheless, Ms Vo’s admissions that Mrs Schembri was engaged in a money-lending business (or that they were together engaged in a money-lending business) were relevant to the question under s 77(1)(c). However, in light of the view to which I have come set out above, it is not necessary to determine the consequences (if any) of Mr O’Mahoney not cross-examining Ms Vo or Mrs Schembri about the money-lending business about which Ms Vo gave evidence and made admissions both in her examination and in her affidavit evidence.
	
	
	For these reasons, Ms Vo has failed to discharge the onus she bears of proving that any portion of the value of the Property (represented presently by the surplus funds which are under the control of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy) was not derived or realised whether directly or indirectly from the commission of any offence (s 77(1)(c) of the Act).
	


Section 77(1)(d): whether Ms Vo has established that her interest is not an instrument of the offence

The parties’ submissions

Ms Vo’s submissions


	
	Ms Dobraszczyk argued that the $130,000 advanced to Ms Vo by Mrs Schembri was not an instrument of an offence since it was not used in connection with Ms Vo’s obtaining the Property by deception and is to be distinguished from the fraudulent representations made to Bankwest as to Ms Vo’s income (in which Ms Dobraszczyk accepted Mrs Schembri was incontrovertibly involved).
	
	
	Ms Dobraszczyk relied on Milne v The Queen [2014] HCA 4; 252 CLR 149, where the meaning of the word “use” was considered in the context of s 400.3 of the Criminal Code which prohibits dealing with money or other property if the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime. The term “instrument of crime” is defined by s 400.1, which relevantly provides that money is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of an offence. The High Court (French CJ, Hayne, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ) said, of present relevance, at [33]:
	


“For property to become an instrument of crime within the meaning of s 400.3(1) it must be “used”. An ordinary meaning of the verb “use” is “[t]o make use of (some immaterial thing) as a means or instrument; to employ for a certain end or purpose” . That is the relevant ordinary meaning for the definition of “become an instrument of crime” which involves the “use” of property to serve a purpose, namely the “commission of an offence” . . .”

[Footnotes omitted.]


	
	Ms Dobraszczyk submitted that it could not be said that the $130,000 was used to obtain a financial advantage by deception, as the word “used” was interpreted in Milne v The Queen.
	


The plaintiff’s submissions


	
	Mr O’Mahoney submitted that what occurred, in substance, was that Ms Vo and Mrs Schembri devised a plan whereby Ms Vo could buy the Property, which would have been impossible without a loan from a bank. Ms Vo and Mrs Schembri knew that her income was insufficient to obtain bank approval and collaborated to prepare false invoices. Mrs Schembri also lent $130,000 to Ms Vo, which Ms Vo represented as an asset when it was actually a liability. But for the $130,000 and the false pay slips, the loan from Bankwest would never have been advanced and Ms Vo could not have purchased the Property. Accordingly, he contended that I could not be satisfied that the $130,000 was not an instrument of the offence since it was used in connection with the offence (of obtaining a financial advantage by deception).
	
	
	Mr O’Mahoney relied on the extended definition of “instrument of an offence” in s 329(2) (set out above) which includes not only property which has been used in the commission of an offence, but also property which has been used “in connection with” the commission of an offence. These words have been found to be words of “wide import”: Taylor v Attorney-General (SA) (1991) 55 SASR 462 (Debelle J). Mr O’Mahoney also referred to White v Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) [2011] HCA 20; 243 CLR 478 at [21] where French CJ, Crennan and Bell JJ (Gummow J agreeing at [33]) considered a similar expression in the corresponding Western Australian legislation and found that the statutory wording went beyond the ordinary meaning of “use” because of the phrase “in connection with”. Justice Gummow agreed with this approach: [33]. Mr O’Mahoney also relied on the approach taken by Edelman J in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Courtenay Investments Ltd (No. 4) [2015] WASC 101 at [474]-[518].
	


Consideration


	
	Although the Property was subsequently sold, this does not affect the status of the surplus funds as an instrument of the offence: s 330(2).
	
	
	The surplus funds have been realised as a result of the sale of the Property which was purchased, in part, with the loan funds from Mrs Schembri and, in part, with funds advanced by Bankwest as a result of Ms Vo using the false payslips created by Mrs Schembri to obtain a financial advantage by deception. The surplus funds are, therefore, proceeds of an unlawful activity. Bankwest was a victim of the criminal conduct that led to its lending on the basis of the false payslips and it has been paid out, as first registered mortgagee, following the sale. Accordingly, the only property in respect of which a compensation order could be made (if Ms Vo discharged her onus of proving the matters in s 77(1)(c) and (d)) is the surplus funds under the control of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (since Bankwest had priority over Ms Vo’s interest in any remaining equity in the Property, in any event).
	
	
	The issue in dispute is whether the funds advanced by Mrs Schembri were “used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence”. The onus lies on Ms Vo to satisfy me that they were not.
	
	
	I have considered the authorities to which I have been referred and had regard to the particular statutory wording addressed in them. Milne v The Queen involved a different statutory wording in that the word “use” did not bear the extended meaning of “use in connection with”. This is a significant distinction since the words “in connection with” require no more than some relationship (which is neither tenuous nor remote) between the property and the offence, which is a lower threshold than is required when the test is “used in the commission of an offence” (as in Milne v The Queen).
	
	
	As Edelman J observed in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Courtenay Investments Ltd (No. 4) at [492], it is necessary to define the alleged facts in the commission of the offence. In the present case, the offence postulated is the offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception.
	
	
	I cannot be satisfied that the loan funds from Mrs Schembri were not an instrument of an offence since there was a substantial connection between the use of the $130,000 obtained from Mrs Schembri and the commission of the offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Ms Vo requested that Mrs Schembri transfer funds from the Westpac account held jointly with her husband to Ms Vo’s bank account for the purpose of Ms Vo using them to obtain a financial advantage (a loan from Bankwest) by deception. The transfer enabled her to represent (falsely) to Bankwest that the funds deposited (from Mrs Schembri) were actually her own savings, rather than (as was the case) monies advanced by Mrs Schembri. Ms Vo admitted that Bankwest would not have lent her the money but for the misrepresentation as to her assets (which included the monies that comprised the loan from Mrs Schembri and which the Bank was led to believe constituted savings).
	
	
	In these circumstances, Ms Vo has failed to discharge the onus she bears of proving that the funds advanced to her from Mrs Schembri (which led to the purchase of the Property) were not an instrument of an offence (s 77(1)(d) of the Act).

		03 June 2016",2016-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701508,Dinh v Commissioner for Fair Trading [2016] NSWCATOD 72,"Reasons for decision


	
	The Applicant held an Endorsed Contractor Licence in the work category of ‘Carpentry’ issued by the respondent in May 2011. In November 2011 the applicant applied to vary his contractor licence to include plumbing and drainage. The variation was granted by the respondent in January 2012.
	
	
	However as part of it’s compliance and audit function the respondent commenced inquiries into the circumstances of the applicant (and other persons applying for licences) in respect of the plumbing licence variation. In early 2014 the respondent issued notices to various referees and other persons who provided information in support of the applicant’s licence variation application (plumbing in November 2011). The respondent prosecuted the applicant for providing false information in support of his November 2011 application and he was convicted and fined in the Local Court in January 2015.
	
	
	As a result of the matters outlined above, the respondent suspended the applicant’s trade licences under section 61A of the Home Building Act 1989 (the HB Act) and in February 2015 issued a Notice to Show Cause as to why his licences should not be cancelled or be disqualified from holding any licence for a period of three years. The applicant responded to the Notice in late February 2015. After following the relevant processes in the HB Act, and hearing the applicant’s response to the finding, the respondent took disciplinary action. On 26 March 2015 the respondent determined that the applicant have his licences cancelled and be disqualified from holding any licence for three years.
	
	
	The applicant applied for an internal review in early April 2015. The respondent determined the matter on 14 May 2015 in April 2015 and affirmed the original decision. On 2 July 2015 the applicant lodged his application for administrative review with the Tribunal.
	


Background


	
	The applicant was prosecuted in the Local Court for the offence of Use false document, to influence the exercise of a public duty under provisions of the Crimes Act 1900. Whilst there were initially three counts of the offence, the respondent withdrew one count and the applicant pleaded guilty to the remaining two counts and was convicted. The applicant was issued with fines totalling $7,700 and other costs of approximately $470 on 30 January 2015.
	
	
	It is primarily these adverse findings which cause the respondent to subsequently determine that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to hold a contractor licence. In making a dishonesty finding against the applicant the respondent then took disciplinary action under the HB Act and cancelled the contractor licence and disqualified the applicant from holding such a licence for a period of three years.
	
	
	The matter was heard by the Tribunal on 17 December 2015. The applicant was legally represented by Counsel and gave evidence at the hearing.
	


The Issue to be decided


	
	The primary issue before the Tribunal in this application is whether the applicant is a fit and proper person (on the available evidence before the Tribunal). Matters relating to the disciplinary action taken are determinative following a primary finding.
	


The Legislative Provisions


	
	Part 4 of the HB Act provides at sections 50 to 69 inclusive for the taking of disciplinary action and proceedings. The HB Act provides for disciplinary action to be taken by the regulator in a number of instances. Section 56 relevantly provides:
	


56 Grounds for taking disciplinary action against holder of a contractor licence

The Secretary may take disciplinary action under section 62 against the holder of a contractor licence on any of the following grounds:

…….

(b) that the holder is not a fit and proper person to hold the contractor licence,

…….


	
	Section 62 provides that disciplinary action may include:
	


62 Disciplinary action that may be taken by Secretary

If, after compliance with this Division, the Secretary is satisfied that any ground on which disciplinary action may be taken against the holder of an authority has been established in relation to the holder, the Secretary may do any one or more of the following:

(a) determine to take no further action against the holder,

(b) caution or reprimand the holder,

(c) make a determination requiring the holder to pay to the Secretary, as a penalty, an amount not exceeding $11,000 (in the case of an individual) or $50,000 (in the case of a corporation) within a specified time,

(d) vary the authority held by the holder, by imposing a condition on the authority, including a condition requiring the holder to undertake a course of training relating to a particular type of work or business practice within a specified time,

(e) suspend the authority for a period not exceeding its unexpired term,

(f) cancel the authority,

(g) disqualify the holder, either temporarily or permanently, from being any one or more of the following:

(i) the holder of any authority, or any specified kind of authority,

(ii) a member of a partnership, or an officer of a corporation that is a member of a partnership, that is the holder of an authority,

(iii) an officer of a corporation that is the holder of an authority.


	
	The respondent after making it’s finding in respect of the applicant not being a fit and proper person, imposed penalties under section 62 (f) and (g) (above), with the disqualification under section 62 (g) being for a period of 3 years.
	


The Hearing


	
	In addition to his initial application for administrative review with attached respondent material, the applicant filed a signed statement and tendered two sets of written submissions. In addition the applicant gave evidence at the hearing and was subject to cross examination. The respondent did not call any witnesses but filed detailed material in accordance with section 58 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997.
	


Applicant's Evidence.


	
	The applicant gave oral evidence at the hearing. In evidence in chief he advised that he arrived in Australia in 1989 and finished university in Queensland in 2003. The applicant studied information technology (IT) at university. The applicant’s evidence was that he did not do any legally based subjects or components in his studies.
	
	
	The applicant’s counsel asked what was the understanding of the Local Court matter, to which the applicant replied that he ‘used the wrong reference’.
	
	
	In cross examination the applicant was asked what he was told after the conclusion of the Court matter, to which her replied that he was told to ‘just pay the fine / fee.’ When questioned further by the respondent’s solicitor about whether anything else arose in respect of his work, the applicant advised that it was his understanding that as he had not received any paper or order prohibiting work, then he was still able to work in his chosen field.
	
	
	The respondent asked the applicant about a specific vocational course that he had attended (‘Greenskills’). He gave evidence that he worked for Ahmed for a short period but that you can’t work for short periods ‘up and down’. The respondent sought to clarify the nature of the applicant’s evidence by further questions on this aspect of subsequent work. At this point the Tribunal issued a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 in respect of the applicant’s evidence. The certificate was given without objection.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he did not know that he could not continue to work with someone else with a contracting qualification / licence. There was evidence concerning one side of a conversation about the applicant obtaining a referee reference for his application to the respondent regulator. The applicant allegedly asked a third party ‘T.H.’ about whether they could help with his obtaining reference. The applicant’s evidence was that ‘T.H.’ answered that he could assist but that it would cost the applicant his car.
	
	
	When he received the reference the applicant questioned its contents with ‘T.H.’ noting that the reference was not from ‘T.H.’ but from ‘C.H.’ who was ‘T.H.’s brother. The applicant stated that there were discrepancies (in his view) between the contents of aspects of the documents that he submitted and the contents of the documents before the Court. His evidence before the Tribunal was that on the application forms he had stated in respect of his work history that he only worked for himself, whereas on the Court documents it said that the entire work history was false. The Tribunal accepts that aspects of what the applicant submitted to the respondent regulator, and its characterisation remain contentious to him.
	
	
	By way of further explanation in his evidence, the applicant stated that he had no real concerns about continuing to work (in the absence of any order from the Department or the Court), as he had to keep his younger employees in work. However by way of clarification in his evidence the applicant stated that whilst those matters (concerning work) were correct, the applicant himself did not actually ‘do any work’. The applicant re-iterated his assessment of events in that he went to Court, the Court made findings and imposed penalties however the Court did not tell him that he could not work.
	
	
	In defence of the information contained within his reference submitted to the regulator – respondent, the applicant advised that ‘it was not my reference, not my writing, not responsible for what was submitted on the day’. The forms it was submitted, ‘that he had filled in were correct when he last dealt with them.’
	
	
	However, on reflection of the conduct in submitting the forms, the applicant stated that ‘I think it in my head now that it is and was the wrong thing to do. I did not know at the time it was wrong because I filled the proper form in.’ In closing his evidence when asked about how he felt after the Court finding and penalty the applicant stated that, ‘After Court I was happy, because I don’t have to lose my licence. Because the Reference was false that is why I went to Court.
	
	
	The applicant had prepared a written statement prior to the hearing. The Statement was prepared approximately seven weeks prior to the hearing. The applicant stated that the Magistrate fined him almost $8,000.00 for the offences, and that he … took the view from the words of the Magistrate that this would be the end of the matter. (Para 4 Exhibit A-2).
	
	
	The applicant in his statement (Para 7 of Exhibit A-2) stated:
	


7. I had no notice from Fair Trading of any further action against me or any further restriction on me between the Court date at Parramatta on 31 January 2015 and the service upon me of a suspension notice at or about 15 February 2015.

8. I certainly had in my mind no thoughts of acting in contempt or lack of respect to the licensing system. My only thoughts were to regularise my licence and I wrongly assumed that Fair Trading would allow me to do that.


	
	When referring to aspects of his work and discussing how he performed his compliance matters arising from that work between the Court finding and the notice from Fair Trading the applicant stated:
	


10. The bookings for inspection of plumbing/drainage work were done in the normal way and were certainly not done in any secretive or clandestine way.

11. There had been no warning or advice to me between the Local Court appearance and the suspension of my licence and once I was on notice of the suspension of my licence I ceased all activities.


	
	The applicant also tendered a document titled ‘Evidence of Requisite Plumbing Experience’ (Exhibit A-1) whereby T. Geagea, C. Hanna and J. Seely provided occupational / character references. Their evidence was tendered without objection and none of the referees were required for examination. The references were directed solely at the applicant’s experience as a tradesperson and specifically in the plumbing area. All three were cognisant of the proceedings before the Tribunal for which they had been prepared.
	


Respondent’s Evidence


	
	Whilst the respondent raised various issues with the applicant continuing to work between the Court date and the initialisation of disciplinary proceedings, their case significantly focussed on the improper conduct of the applicant.
	
	
	In the section 58 material that was tendered as Exhibit ‘R-1’ in the proceedings, it was clear that the disciplinary action was predominantly based on the conduct proven at Court. In this regard the respondent tendered the Agreed Statement of Facts. The following relevant matters are set out in those Facts.
	


Particulars: The defendant used false documents, knowing them to be false, intending to induce a Licensing Officer from Home Building Licensing Division to accept it as genuine, and, because of it being accepted as genuine, influence the exercise of a public duty, being the issue of a plumbing contractor’s licence by the Home Building Division.

False documents being a Fair Trading application for a plumbing contractor’s licence and a referee statement purportedly in the name of Charlie Hanna in support of the application.


	
	The Notice to Show Cause dated 13 February 2015 set out that the grounds for disciplinary action were that the applicant had: improperly obtained the licence – section 56 (j) of the Act (the HB Act).
	
	
	Under the Grounds for Disciplinary Action the respondents Notice stated : You are not a fit and proper person to hold a contractor licence – section 56 (b) of the Act (the HB Act).
	
	
	The Respondent’s evidence comprising some 211 folios did contain a significant amount of material which had ether been prepared by the applicant or had been prepared on his behalf. Included in that material was copies of various statements from the brief of evidence in the criminal proceedings, which included statements and material identifying an organisation ESBT Management as the principal perpetrators of the ‘fraudulent’ scheme of which the applicant became a participant.
	


Applicants Submissions


	
	It was submitted that the applicant had admitted the serious matters and was content to have the Tribunal re-determine the appropriate penalty aspect of the decision under review. This it was submitted was particularly in respect of the adverse inferences drawn against the applicant due to the brief period of work in February 2015 following the Court outcome.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that he had shown genuine regret and remorse by entering pleas of guilty at the first opportunity before the Court. It was submitted that in relation to the improper conduct in agreeing to the scheme put forth by ESBT Management, the applicant was not trying to excuse his behaviour to the respondent or the Tribunal, but merely attempting to explain it.
	
	
	The applicant’s Counsel re-iterated that in their view, the respondent’s officers had formed an unfair characterisation of Mr Dinh in their subsequent dealing with him.
	


11. The Respondent through the primary decision maker and then through the review officer has found contempt by Mr Dinh to the regulator and its authority by continuing to book (and attempting to book) inspections under his contractor licence after the Local Court proceedings. (Para 11 applicant’s subs filed 1 September 2015).

12. The explanation for this conduct is simply that Mr Dinh was operating under the impression that he could operate until such time as he was formally contacted by the Respondent.


	
	The respondent submitted that the Court fines were intended to act as a punishment for the applicant, and Counsel submitted that this was clear from the sentencing Magistrates words. It was also submitted that in the criminal law jurisdiction / context judicial officers take note of the total criminality.
	
	
	Finally submissions were made as to the high quality of the applicant’s work and his ensuing high level of skill. It was submitted that there had been over 300 inspections by Fair Trading of the applicant’s work without any apparent complaint.
	


The Respondent's submissions


	
	The respondent filed written submissions. Reference was made to subsections 33A of the HB Act.
	


33A Disqualification from holding authorities

(1) A person is disqualified from holding an authority (other than an owner-builder permit) if the person:

(a) has been convicted in New South Wales or elsewhere of an offence involving dishonesty within the last 10 years, unless the Secretary has determined under subsection (2) that the offence should be ignored, or

(2) The Secretary may determine that an offence committed by a person should be ignored for the purposes of this section because of the time that has passed since the offence was committed or because of the triviality of the acts or omissions giving rise to the offence.


	
	The respondent submitted that these provisions reflect the Parliament’s clear intention to provide a set period of disqualification, which can then be reduced depending on when the application is lodged, if the factors in subsection 33A (2) warrant a reduction of this period.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the three references tendered by the applicant should be given little weight. A number of grounds are set out by the respondent concerning the relevance to these proceedings (being ‘disciplinary proceedings’), the fact that they were not on approved Fair Trading forms, and the fact that the applicant (whilst at the relevant time licensed) appears to have been supervised by these referees and the references all post date the offences actually occurring.
	
	
	Whilst the relevance of these objections was a matter of some conjecture in the proceedings, I note that the Respondent did not seek to challenge the referees’ evidence directly by putting propositions to them at hearing.
	


Applicant’s Further Submissions


	
	The applicant filed further submissions in the matter and addressed matters raised by the respondent. The applicant addressed matters pertaining to rehabilitation and double punishment in his further submissions. Reference was made to the case of Grenfell v Director General of the Department of Finance and Services [2013] NSWADT 57. At paragraph 15 Judicial Member Molony stated:
	


the Tribunal is required to take into account the nature and seriousness of the original misconduct, any events relevant to an assessment of the applicant's fitness which have occurred since then, the candour with which the applicant has approached the issue of past misconduct, the applicant's explanation of the misconduct, the impact of the effluxion of time, and the applicant's present circumstances and reputation.

Consideration


	
	The respondent submitted that the case of Hughes and Vale Pty Ltd v New South Wales (No 2) [1955] HCA 28 at paragraph 9 sets out the considerations which make up the meaning of the expression. Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Webb JJ said at paragraph 9 that:
	


The expression ""fit and proper person"" is of course familiar enough as traditional words when used with reference to offices and perhaps vocations. But their very purpose is to give the widest scope for judgment and indeed for rejection. ""Fit"" (or ""idoneus"") with respect to an office is said to involve three things, honesty knowledge and ability: ""honesty to execute it truly, without malice affection or partiality; knowledge to know what he ought duly to do; and ability as well in estate as in body, that he may intend and execute his office, when need is, diligently, and not for impotency or poverty neglect it"" - Coke.


	
	The Tribunal was also taken to the case of Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 where Toohey and Gaudron JJ at paragraph 36 of the decision addressed the issue.
	


36. The expression ""fit and proper person"", standing alone, carries no precise meaning. It takes its meaning from its context, from the activities in which the person is or will be engaged and the ends to be served by those activities. The concept of ""fit and proper"" cannot be entirely divorced from the conduct of the person who is or will be engaging in those activities. However, depending on the nature of the activities, the question may be whether improper conduct has occurred, whether it is likely to occur, whether it can be assumed that it will not occur, or whether the general community will have confidence that it will not occur. The list is not exhaustive but it does indicate that, in certain contexts, character (because it provides indication of likely future conduct) or reputation (because it provides indication of public perception as to likely future conduct) may be sufficient to ground a finding that a person is not fit and proper to undertake the activities in question.


	
	In the respondent’s submission the import of these cases is that the Tribunal should note that the notions of ‘fitness’ etc. take their meaning from the context. However I note that the main cases concerning fit and proper (including the ADT case of Grenfell) were relied upon by both parties.
	


Consideration


	
	I have carefully considered all of the material submitted by the parties in these proceedings. It is clear from the evidence and submissions that the applicant was responsible for the submission of an application, which on the face of the record was fraudulent.
	


Finding of Fact


	
	The Tribunal is therefore satisfied and I make a finding that the applicant has knowingly or deliberately provided false or misleading information to the respondent. Whilst this matter was not controversial between the parties during the hearing before the Tribunal, and was predicated on a finding in the Local Court, in my view it is necessary to make that finding afresh in order to completely review the administrative decision of the respondent regulator.
	


Further consideration


	
	On the evidence before the Tribunal it is clear that the applicant had significant deficits in his ability to assertively communicate and advocate a position. The Tribunal noted the applicant came to this country in the late 1980’s and has an adequate (if somewhat limited) understanding of English.
	
	
	It is clear that he followed the suggestions of others, but failed to verify material prepared on his behalf and independently satisfy himself as to its veracity.
	
	
	It is also clear however that he has taken responsibility for his actions and when faced with the import if those actions, he has been compliant with the process.
	
	
	I reject the respondent’s submissions in respect of the references provided in these proceedings. Whilst the respondent’s technical objections are arguable, in my view they do little to diminish the applicant’s case, especially in respect of the fact that the respondent did not require those persons for examination. However, those references only assist the applicant in verifying the standard of his work, and in that regard address one of the prongs of fit and proper.
	
	
	In addition having had regard to all of the evidence and submissions of the parties, I reject the notion that the applicant (in continuing to trade for a short period in February 2015), was in any way contemptuous of the authority of the regulator.
	
	
	Whilst such a matter is not clearly imported into the respondent’s calculation of the appropriate penalty (period of disqualification to impose), I note from the written reasons of the delegate in first instance, and on review, that significant additional weight was placed on this finding against the applicant.
	
	
	On a separate aspect, in my view in these proceedings there is a clear honesty deficit going directly to the notion of ‘fit and proper’ as set out in the head cases, and which in some part substantiates the actual basis of the respondent – regulator’s actions against the applicant as a result of the criminal findings.
	
	
	However when turning to the criminal findings, in my view the penalty imposed whilst not custodial, is at the high range of penalties dispensed by the Local Court by way of a fine. I accept the evidence and submissions that the penalty was predominantly a punishment of the applicant, with some deterrent effect. I note that the purpose of the sanctions under the HB Act is by way of consumer protection rather than punishment.
	
	
	I therefore note that the HB Act is a consumer protection statute, and in that regard it is protective not punitive in nature. This is therefore a protective jurisdiction. The legislation that regulates the home building industry is not only protective of consumers, but future consumers in that the public can have confidence in the integrity of residential construction. The Crimes Act on the other hand is a proscriptive statute the purpose of which is to prevent persons from committing crimes, by both setting out a significant number of offences against the individual or society, and prescribing penalties for transgression. In this manner that statute could be considered as being proscriptive and punitive, with a significant deterrent value. The HB Act however aims to safeguard the public confidence in the industry. A high level of honesty and trust are of paramount importance but candour with the regulator is also required to maintain that public confidence. It is also imperative that licensees can be trusted to protect the interests of the community.
	
	
	In my view it is clear that the role of the Local Court was to impose a penalty to both punish and deter the applicant from reoffending (or others) from offending. Depending on the quality of the evidence, it would be open to the regulator to prosecute persons in the applicant’s position, and take regulatory action against them under the HB Act, or to merely take regulatory disciplinary action. In making this observation I am in no way critical of the action taken to date by the respondent. The actions are clearly sanctioned by law (on the available evidence before me) and in addition such action is in my view in the public interest.
	
	
	The full suite of grounds that the Respondent can take in respect of disciplinary action is set out at section 57 of the HB Act. The section provides that:
	


57 Grounds for taking disciplinary action against holder of a supervisor or tradesperson certificate

The Secretary may take disciplinary action under section 62 against the holder of a supervisor or tradesperson certificate on any of the following grounds:

(a) that the holder is not entitled to hold the certificate,

(b) that the holder is not a fit and proper person to hold the certificate,

(c) that the holder is guilty of improper conduct,

(d) that the holder is not capable of doing all or part of the work that the certificate authorises the holder to do,

(e) that the holder has failed to comply with a condition of the certificate imposed by a determination under this Part,

(f) that the certificate was improperly obtained,

(g) that the Secretary has become aware of information about the holder that, if known at the time the application for the certificate was determined, would have been grounds for refusing the application.


	
	Section 62 sets out the nature of disciplinary action.
	


62 Disciplinary action that may be taken by Secretary

If, after compliance with this Division, the Secretary is satisfied that any ground on which disciplinary action may be taken against the holder of an authority has been established in relation to the holder, the Secretary may do any one or more of the following:

(a) determine to take no further action against the holder,

(b) caution or reprimand the holder,

(c) make a determination requiring the holder to pay to the Secretary, as a penalty, an amount not exceeding $11,000 (in the case of an individual) or $50,000 (in the case of a corporation) within a specified time,

(d) vary the authority held by the holder, by imposing a condition on the authority, including a condition requiring the holder to undertake a course of training relating to a particular type of work or business practice within a specified time,

(e) suspend the authority for a period not exceeding its unexpired term,

(f) cancel the authority,

(g) disqualify the holder, either temporarily or permanently, from being any one or more of the following:

(i) the holder of any authority, or any specified kind of authority,

(ii) a member of a partnership, or an officer of a corporation that is a member of a partnership, that is the holder of an authority,

(iii) an officer of a corporation that is the holder of an authority.


	
	Having regard to all of the evidence and material submitted before the Tribunal, in my view there should be some variation to the decision of the respondent, without disturbing the primary finding of the respondent. In that regard the matter can be remedied by varying the penalty imposed on the applicant.
	


Orders


	
	The Respondent’s decision to cancel the applicant’s contractor licence is affirmed.
	
	
	The Respondent’s decision to disqualify the applicant for 3 years from being the holder of any contractor licence, supervisor certificate or tradesperson certificate, a member of a partnership that is the holder of a contractor licence or an officer of a corporation that is the holder of a contractor licence is set aside.
	
	
	In substitution for the Respondent’s decision set out in Order 2 above, the following decision is made:
	


The applicant is disqualified for 2 years from 14 May 2015 from being the holder of any contractor licence, supervisor certificate or tradesperson certificate, a member of a partnership that is the holder of a contractor licence or an officer of a corporation that is the holder of a contractor licence.

		03 June 2016",2016-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal
2701524,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 56) [2016] NSWSC 773,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The jury in these proceedings retired in the early afternoon of Thursday 2 June 2016. At approximately 8.45 am today I was advised by the Sheriff that a member of the jury had telephoned to say that he had fallen ill and could not attend court. At that stage I was given no further information about the nature and extent of the juror’s illness. I requested the Sheriff to ensure that a medical certificate was provided to me by 2pm today.
	
	
	When the Court convened at 10.00 am I informed counsel of what had transpired. The Crown foreshadowed that he may make application that the juror be discharged and that the deliberations continue with a jury of 11. The Crown asked I take whatever steps might be available to expedite the provision of a medical certificate. In indicating his position, the Crown made reference to (inter alia) the desirability of ensuring, if at all possible, that the jury's deliberations continued without interruption.
	
	
	The Sheriff, at my direction, then telephoned the juror to enquire firstly as to the nature of his illness, and secondly as to what arrangements he had made to obtain medical assistance. The Sheriff was informed that the juror had made arrangements to attend upon a medical practitioner at 10.45 am today. The Sheriff was also informed by the juror that he was suffering from some form of gastroenteritis, and that he was prone to suffering from anxiety. The nature and extent of the latter condition was not further explained. The information provided to the Sheriff was conveyed to counsel.
	
	
	A medical certificate (which is now MFI 217) was subsequently received and provided to me, from which I redacted information which had the potential to identify the juror in question. The Certificate read:
	


“Mr (name of juror) is medically unfit for jury duty today as he has acute viral gastritis today.”


	
	The certificate is under the hand of Dr Tien Phan. It made no reference to the anxiety to which the juror referred in his earlier conversation with the Sheriff.
	
	
	Appraised of that information, the Crown made an application that I exercise my discretion to discharge the juror and order that the trial continue with eleven members of the jury. The Crown submitted that central to the exercise of my discretion was the necessity to maintain what he described as ""the integrity of the trial process"". The Crown submitted that the jury were obviously working towards a verdict and had been retired now for some days and that in the circumstances, and even though there had been an intervening weekend since the jury’s deliberations commenced, it was undesirable to have the continuity of those deliberations further interrupted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that even if the discretion was exercised in favour of discharging the juror, there was no danger of the number of the jury descending to anywhere near the minimum number required. The Crown further submitted that, in light of the terms of the certificate, there was a level of uncertainty as to whether the juror would be able to resume tomorrow. The Crown also pointed out that the certificate made no reference to the juror’s reported anxiety. The Crown submitted that a combination of all of these factors supported the making of an order that the juror be discharge.
	
	
	Mr Wendler, who appears for McNamara, opposed the Crown’s application. Although he made references to the determination being mandatory, he ultimately accepted that it was a matter for the exercise of my discretion, taking into account all relevant factors. He submitted that the operative section was s. 53B(a) of the Jury Act 1977 NSW (“the Act”) and that, if I concluded that the discretion should not be exercised under that section, I should then proceed to consider the wider discretion contained in s. 53B(d). Shortly put, Mr Wendler’s position was that the evidence established nothing more than the fact that the juror could not attend today. He pointed out, in particular, that there was no evidence before the Court which indicated, one way or the other, what the position might be tomorrow. Although he accepted that if the present situation was to extend into the Crown’s position would be stronger, he submitted that to discharge the juror at this point would be premature.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, also opposed the Crown's application and essentially adopted the submissions made by Mr Wendler. In doing so, he submitted that to the extent that any inference could be drawn from MFI 217, it was that the juror’s inability to discharge his functions extended (at least at this point) only to today. He submitted that in light of the length of this trial, the loss of one day would cause no real disruption. Like Mr Wendler, Mr Thomas also appeared to accept that the position might be different if the present situation prevailed tomorrow.
	
	
	Section 53B of the Act is in the following terms:
	


Discretionary discharge of individual juror

53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest discharge a juror if:

(a) the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or

(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

Note : Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.


	
	As the Crown pointed out in argument, there may be some doubt in the present case as to whether s 53B(a) applies at all. Given the view that I have reached, that is not an issue I am required to determine. That said, the terms of s. 53B(a) appear to contemplate the exercise of discretion where a juror is able to discharge his or her duties but has become so ill to the point where (inter alia) he or she is likely to become unable to serve as a juror. On the evidence before me the juror in question is not able to discharge his duties, at least today. If that interpretation were correct, then the Crown’s application would attract the application of s. 53B(d), which confers a wide discretion to discharge a juror. Irrespective of the provision pursuant to which any discretion might be exercised, I have come to the conclusion that the Crown’s application should be refused.
	
	
	Some of the factors which inform the exercise of the discretion were discussed in the decision of the High Court in R v Wu [1999] HCA 52; (1999) 199 CLR 99 (as well as in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Wu v R (1998) 103 A Crim R 416). The facts of that case are similar to those in the present case before me, at least to the extent that the issue involved the discharge of a juror on account of illness.
	
	
	There is a necessity in a case such as the present to obtain such information as might be available and to engage in a discussion with counsel before making any determination. Factors which inform the exercise of the discretion include the length of the trial, and the consequent hardship to an accused. Whilst the Act obviously contemplates an accused being tried by a jury of less than 12 persons, I must have regard to the right of an accused person to a trial by a jury of 12. The desirability of ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay is also a relevant consideration.
	
	
	Obviously, the present trial has proceeded for far longer than was initially envisaged. As a consequence, the members of the jury have been put to considerable inconvenience over a long period of time. However on the evidence before me, the circumstances which prevent the juror from attending are limited to today. There is nothing in MFI 217 which might suggest that the problem will extend into tomorrow. It follows that as matters presently stand, if I were to refuse the Crown’s application what will be lost in terms of the jury's deliberations will be one day. Counsel for each of the accused, without ultimately conceding the point, have recognised that if the present situation were to extend into tomorrow, the Crown’s position would clearly be stronger.
	
	
	In my view, whilst there will necessarily be some degree of interruption to deliberations if the remaining 11 jurors are sent away and asked to come back tomorrow, such interruption is not of a magnitude which would justify the Crown’s application being granted. Whilst I accept unreservedly the Crown's submission that it is important to preserve the integrity of the trial process, I am not satisfied that such integrity will be compromised in any way at all if the juror is given an opportunity to recuperate today, with a view to deliberations resuming tomorrow.
	
	
	For those reasons, the Crown’s application is refused.

		15 June 2016",2016-06-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701539,Hammond v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 701,"Judgment


	
	By Amended Summons filed in the Registry of this Court on 8 April 2016, the plaintiff seeks leave pursuant to s 53(3)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the CAR Act”) to appeal against interlocutory orders made on 16 November 2015 by his Honour Magistrate Richardson sitting in the Local Court of New South Wales. Alternatively, relief of the nature set out in ss 65 and 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) is sought.
	
	
	The matter came before me for hearing on 31 May 2016 but was ultimately resolved, with the parties agreeing that proceedings in the Local Court had miscarried, and asking for orders to be made by this Court by consent setting aside the orders of the Local Court.
	
	
	The orders made by this Court on 31 May 2016 are:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 54(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act leave granted to the plaintiffs to appeal.
	
	
	The appeal is upheld.
	
	
	The order of the second defendant refusing the plaintiffs’ applications for separate hearings pursuant to s 21(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) is set aside.
	



	
	These are my reasons for the orders made on 31 May 2016.
	


The Background to the Application


	
	The plaintiffs read and relied upon affidavits of Michael Jaloussis of 11 April 2016 and Helen Langley of 18 May 2016, together with annexures referred to by each deponent. What follows is drawn from that evidence.
	
	
	The plaintiffs are all corrective services officers employed by the Department of Corrective Services and working within prisons as members of a tactical response squad, known as the Immediate Action Team. They, together with six other officers who are not party to these proceedings, have been charged with a number of offences connected with the alleged assault of inmates of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (“MRRC”), a correctional facility in Sydney operated by the Department. All of the charges against the plaintiffs are offences listed in Table 1 or 2 to Schedule 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and are ordinarily heard summarily in the Local Court. These matters will proceed to finality in that jurisdiction.
	
	
	The prosecution of the plaintiffs is being conducted by the first defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“the DPP”), and is presently before the Local Court at Burwood.
	
	
	On 28 October 2015 the matters were listed before the Magistrate for a number of interlocutory applications to be heard and determined. The DPP sought to adduce tendency and coincidence evidence pursuant to ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) against the plaintiffs, and to conduct the hearings as a joint hearing pursuant to s 29(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The plaintiffs objected to the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence, and sought an order separating the proceedings pursuant to s 21(2) of the same Act.
	
	
	The applications were heard on 28 October 2015, and rulings made on that date and on 16 November 2015. The Magistrate held that both tendency and coincidence evidence was admissible with respect to the plaintiffs Hammond and Faitua, whilst tendency evidence was admitted with respect to the plaintiff Chasle. The application by the plaintiffs for separate hearings was refused.
	
	
	The plaintiffs challenge the rulings of the Magistrate, contending that the orders made by the court were not open to it to make.
	
	
	The first defendant concedes that proposition, and submits that the orders of the Local Court with respect to a joint hearing should be set aside.
	


The Error in the Local Court Proceedings


	
	Since the parties both agree that the proceedings before the Local Court miscarried, the nature of the error can be briefly stated.
	
	
	The interlocutory applications were determined in the Local Court by the tender of statements of some witnesses, principally of those inmates who alleged assaults by the plaintiffs. A summary chart was also provided referencing the documentary evidence. No witnesses were called and, although reference was made in submissions to evidence in the nature of recordings from closed circuit security cameras in operation at the MRRC, no recordings were in fact tendered to the Local Court. The parties each made written and oral submissions as to the orders that should be made.
	
	
	The evidentiary material tendered to the Local Court has not been provided to this Court, but the parties agree that there was no evidence before the Local Court that was capable of identifying the plaintiffs as the individuals involved in the alleged assaults. The absence of such evidence was a feature noted during the course of the proceedings by the Magistrate, who commented that identification of the plaintiffs was simply “assumed.”
	
	
	Unhelpfully, the summary chart prepared jointly by the parties that was tendered to the court relied on such an assumption. The chart was provided to his Honour as, in the words of counsel for the plaintiff, “a heads up as to particular alleged victims, particular prison officers, particular dates, so your Honour can see where they are on each date” (T10:44 – 46 of 28.10.2015). The chart named the plaintiffs in the context of the allegations made by the various plaintiffs, presuming the identification of each.
	
	
	The matter should not have been advanced before the Local Court on the basis of presumed identification, where no concession as to that point had in fact been made and where there was no evidence before the Magistrate which could make good the identification of the plaintiffs. The chart did no more than further cloud was should have been, absent a concession, a fundamental issue of proof.
	
	
	Although the question of identification of the plaintiffs was plainly a significant point that ought to have figured prominently during the proceedings, it was not raised in the submissions for the first defendant, or in the oral submissions for the plaintiffs. Counsel for the first defendant has advised the Court that there was a reference to identification in the plaintiffs’ written submissions to the Local Court, but those submissions do not form part of the evidence before this Court.
	
	
	In an ex tempore decision delivered on 28 October 2015, the Magistrate referred again to the issue of the absence of evidence capable of identifying the plaintiffs:
	


“I say this, repeating the observation I made earlier, which is that between the statements being made by these complainants and today, here, there would appear to have been identification either conceded or established or in some other way. There is very little identification evidence in any of these statements, on the face of it, but it would appear from the submissions that something has happened between then and now to enable names to be put to phrases like “Islander squad member”, “Caucasian squad officer”. I will only say that once, I will not say it again, but it appears to me that that has occurred somehow and I accept, for the sake of this decision, that there is no issue for me to dwell on in regard to that.” (T27:39 – 48 of 28.10.2015)


	
	Proceeding on the basis that the issue of identification was not one that he had to determine, the Magistrate went on to consider the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence, and the consequential issue of separate hearings, ultimately making the orders referred to in summary form above.
	
	
	It is clear from his Honour’s remarks extracted at [18] that, probably misled by the chart and the complete absence of focus upon the issue by the parties, he considered identification to have been conceded by the plaintiffs or, at least, that no issue was taken with that aspect of the evidence for the purposes of the applications then being determined.
	
	
	How that error could occur, given the way the matter was approached by the parties, is entirely understandable; that it was an error however, is plain.
	
	
	His Honour’s erroneous conclusion as to the concession made concerning the identification of the plaintiffs as the squad members responsible for the alleged assaults of inmates was a conclusion fundamental to the rulings concerning the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence, and in turn a conclusion fundamental to the order made for the matters to proceed as a joint hearing. In that sense, the orders of the Local Court have been fatally infected by the error as to identification evidence.
	
	
	The review sought in the first instance by the plaintiffs is pursuant to s 53(3)(b) of the CAR Act. That provision is in the following terms:
	


“53   Appeals requiring leave

[…]

(3)  Any person against whom:

(a)  […]

(b)  an interlocutory order has been made by the Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings,

may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court.

(4) An application for leave to appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction, sentence or order as may be prescribed by rules of court.”


	
	The orders made in the Local Court for a joint hearing pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act are interlocutory orders susceptible to review pursuant to s 53(3)(b).
	
	
	The grounds relied upon by the plaintiffs in the Amended Summons do not include a ground asserting error of law in the decision to order a joint hearing. Instead, grounds are advanced relevant to the decision to admit tendency and coincidence evidence. This Court has not been asked to determine those grounds which were, in effect, abandoned.
	
	
	Before this Court the plaintiffs contend, and the first defendant concedes, that there was error of law in the order made for a joint hearing. I am satisfied that there was such an error of law infecting the order for a joint hearing, and that it is therefore appropriate to make the orders that the parties jointly seek.
	
	
	Whilst this Court is not asked to set aside the orders of the Local Court as to the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence, the Local Court can itself reconsider those questions if necessary, pursuant to s 130A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	It is noted that the determination of questions connected with the admissibility of such evidence is a matter for the Local Court, as is the determination of the application for separate trials that is to be pursued by the plaintiffs. Nothing said in this judgment can, or should, have any bearing on those questions.
	


**********

ADDENDUM TO THE JUDGMENT OF 1 JUNE 2016: Following publication of this judgment, the parties contacted the Court to advise that the documents referred to at [14] and [17] as not being before the Court on the hearing of the application, were in fact filed with the Registry as part of the evidentiary material relied upon. It would therefore appear that some of the documentary evidence annexed to the affidavit material submitted through the Registry was not placed with the Court's file. Although the absence of the material is of no significance in the determination of the matter, or to the Court's reasons, the fact that it was filed is acknowledged here by this addendum.

2701542,R v Blanks [2016] NSWSC 707,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

Introduction


	
	The defendant, Judith Thelma Blanks, was charged on indictment that on 15 January 2012 at Wondabyne in the State of New South Wales, she did murder Shayne MacDonald. To that charge she is taken to have pleaded not guilty: s 21(3)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”).
	
	
	On 25 May 2015 this Court (RS Hulme AJ) made an order that the defendant was unfit to be tried in accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 and referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
	
	
	On 1 September 2015 the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to s 16 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act determined that the defendant was unfit to stand trial, that is, that she did not have the mental capacity to meet the requirements for a fair and just trial and would not become fit to be tried for the offence with which she had been charged within 12 months of the Court’s finding of unfitness. Consequently pursuant to the MH (FP) Act it was necessary that she be tried under a special procedure in accordance with the provisions of ss 19 and 21 of that Act.
	
	
	Following a special hearing conducted under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the MH (FP) Act”) without a jury, on 15-17 and 23-24 February 2016, the defendant was found, on the limited evidence available, not guilty of murder but guilty of the offence of manslaughter of Shayne McDonald.
	
	
	The proceedings were then stood over for sentence on 28 April 2016.
	
	
	The Mental Health Review Tribunal will in due course determine whether the defendant is still suffering from a mental illness and whether she should be detained in a mental health facility for treatment.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of manslaughter is a term of imprisonment of 25 years: s 24 Crimes Act 1900. It has often been recognised that the offence of manslaughter covers a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Determining an appropriate sentence for manslaughter, it has been stated, is “notoriously difficult”: R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97 at [24].
	
	
	The range of degrees of culpability in relation to a conviction for manslaughter is so wide that it is not possible to point to any established tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability: R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, 12 December 1995, unreported) per Gleeson CJ.
	
	
	It is now my task to nominate a limiting term of imprisonment, as required by s 23(1)(b) of the MH (FP) Act. I do so on the basis of the finding I made that, on the limited evidence available, the defendant committed the offence of involuntary manslaughter (by unlawful and dangerous act). The term to be imposed must be my best estimate of the sentence which would have been appropriate if the defendant had been found guilty of manslaughter at a normal trial.
	
	
	At the hearing on 28 April 2016, the Crown tendered a folder of documents entitled Crown Materials on Sentence. The folder of documents was marked as Exhibit A on the sentence hearing. In accordance with the index to Exhibit A the following documents were included in it:

Submissions


	
	Following the hearing, by leave, Ms Loukas SC who appeared on behalf of the defendant, submitted a bundle of reports and medical treatment notes which formed Annexure A to the Further Submissions on behalf of Judith Blanks dated 16 May 2016. The documents comprising Annexure A include a report of Dr Iyer dated 4 June 2012, a report of Dr Michael Harrison dated 13 November 2014, and serial reports of Dr Neil Janes. The additional medical reports to which I have referred, and to which the Crown does not object, has been marked as Exhibit 3 in the proceedings.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon written submissions dated 27 April 2016. Those submissions were supplemented with further oral submissions on 28 April 2016.
	
	
	On 28 April 2016, Ms Loukas SC relied upon her written submissions dated 28 April 2016, together with a folder of sentencing decisions, and her oral submissions. Subsequently by leave, as I have stated, Ms Loukas relied upon her Further Submissions on Behalf of Judith Blanks dated 26 May 2016 together with the documents constituting Exhibit 3.
	
	
	I have, of course, had regard to all submissions made on sentence.
	
	
	Under the MH (FP) Act a person is not sentenced in the ordinary way. Rather, the trial judge is required to nominate a term, called under that Act the limiting term, being the maximum period for which a person may be detained in institutional care for the offence.
	
	
	In accordance with the provisions of s 23 if, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court:
	



	
	Must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and
	
	
	Where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term in respect of that offence, being, as I have stated, the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence: s 23(1)(a) and (b).
	



	
	Once the limiting term has been nominated, the Court refers the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) and makes such orders with respect to custody as it considers appropriate: s 24(1). The Tribunal determines the appropriateness of hospital treatment and notifies the Court accordingly: s 24(2), (3). The Court may make an order as to the custody of the accused: s 27.
	


Provisions Concerning the Limiting Term


	
	Section 23 of the MH (FP) Act does not authorise a division of a limiting term into a minimum and additional term. It only requires the nomination of a total term: R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120 at [21]. As observed in that case, a minimum term would be inconsistent with the MH (FP) Act review process: at [21].
	
	
	It was also observed by the Court in Mitchell that the purpose of the comparative estimate referred to in s 23 of the Act is to ensure that a limiting term under the MH (FP) Act is neither more harsh, nor more lenient, than a total sentence would have been in a case of a person fit to plead: at [32].
	


The Approach in Determining a Limiting Term


	
	As s 23 requires that the best estimate be made of the sentence that the accused would have received after a normal criminal trial a sentencing judge must have regard to the usual sentencing principles: Mitchell at [35]. Accordingly, it is necessary in the present case to have regard, inter alia, to the following matters:
	



	
	The maximum penalty provided by statute for the offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	The gravity of the objective features of the case.
	
	
	All relevant subjective considerations relevant to the defendant.
	
	
	The “well-established principles of sentencing” as identified by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476, which include the “protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform”: Mitchell at [36].
	



	
	In determining the limiting term to be imposed in this case, I must have regard to the defendant’s mental condition at the time of the offence and the impact that it had, including upon the subjective features relevant to sentence.
	
	
	An offender’s mental condition is relevant to the length of the limiting terms in at least three ways:
	



	
	The offender’s culpability.
	
	
	The likelihood of re-offending.
	
	
	The protection of the community.
	



	
	Precisely how each affects the length of a limiting term depends upon the circumstances of each case: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [3].
	


The Objective Circumstances of the Offending


	
	The facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the Court’s previous judgment: R v Blanks [2016] NSWSC 361 and, aside from some matters, need not be repeated here. In brief, the defendant and the deceased lived a nomadic lifestyle, often camping in wilderness areas. They had spent a good deal of their time drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis. Both took medication under prescription being an opiate called Tramadol.
	
	
	At the time of the offence they were camping in a remote area of the Brisbane Waters National Park. The relationship between them was a tempestuous one. The evidence indicated that on the day of the offence the defendant was the aggressive partner constantly yelling and swearing at the deceased. There was other evidence that indicated that the defendant had exhibited conduct as the aggressive partner prior to the day of the offence.
	
	
	On 14 January 2014, the defendant at one point had threatened to stab the deceased and to tip over his beer. She denied that she had assaulted the deceased at any time in her ERISP.
	
	
	On 15 January 2012, the defendant was preparing a meal. She was cutting up vegetables with a blue knife and she was then located in the tent. The deceased entered the tent and, on the Crown case, an argument ensued with the defendant lashing out at the deceased with the knife, she then being in the seated position, striking him in the upper thigh severing his femoral artery, as a result of which he bled to death.
	
	
	In the judgment delivered on 1 April 2016, I examined the evidence relating to the circumstances of the offence, including the expert evidence relied upon by the Crown. In proceeding to sentence the defendant I am to have regard to, and act upon, the basis of the findings made in the judgment that I delivered on 1 April 2016. Those findings include the following:
	



	
	That the deceased died by reason of a knife wound inflicted by the defendant. As indicated on autopsy performed by Dr Beer on 17 January 2012, the stab wound was located in the upper inner medial aspect of the deceased’s left thigh. The wound, after penetrating muscles, soft tissues of the thigh, severed the left femoral artery. Dr Beer noted the stab wound to the left upper thigh had gone up approximately at a 45 degree angle.
	
	
	At the time of inflicting the wound the defendant was, as I have stated, in the seated position using the knife in question to cut vegetables for an evening meal. Following an argument after the deceased entered the tent then being used, the defendant lashed out with the knife in an upwards movement from that position.
	
	
	The defendant’s reaction in doing so, though unlawful and dangerous, was found to have exhibited features characteristic of a spontaneous reactive action, though one which carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. The defendant’s action in doing so was devoid of any actual intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	On a consideration of the whole of the evidence I was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of stabbing the deceased the defendant had an intention to kill the deceased, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.
	
	
	In acting as she did in stabbing the deceased, the defendant was aware that her act was dangerous and a reasonable person would have appreciated that the act was one which, in the circumstances, exposed the deceased to the risk of serious injury. Such an unlawful and dangerous act occasioning the death of Mr MacDonald in the present case constituted the offence of manslaughter.
	



	
	The defendant’s abusive conduct towards the deceased is to be examined and understood, and assessed in light of the medical evidence. That evidence establishes that, from a reasonably young age, the defendant had developed a chronic alcoholic and substance abuse disorder. Her conduct towards the deceased when she inflicted the stab wound upon him was, on that evidence, related to her chronic alcoholism and substance abuse disorder and associated impairment of her cognitive processes.
	


The Defendant’s Medical Condition


	
	The defendant is presently aged 58 years. She has a relatively slight and essentially irrelevant criminal record. There is evidence that her mother was of Aboriginal heritage.
	
	
	The evidence as to her unhappy childhood upbringing which included her exposure to violence, and the fact in her later years of her two traumatic relationships with her first and second partners, are principally based upon her accounts as given by her to various medical practitioners. Caution must be exercised in relying upon self‑reporting by an accused person to examining and treating medical practitioners where there is no direct evidence from the person charged with an offence: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353. It has accordingly been necessary to examine all the medical reports, including those written by medical practitioners who have been involved in treating the defendant. The reports have been examined in order to determine whether there exists a consistency and therefore a reliability in her accounts. They also, of course, have been examined with a view to reaching a full and proper understanding of the defendant’s mental state as at the date of the offence.
	
	
	It is noteworthy that in the report of Dr Iyer, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 4 June 2012, written to Dr Michael Harrison following the latter’s referral of the defendant for psychiatric assessment, that Dr Iyer noted that the defendant was reluctant to disclose personal information. However, with encouragement, she admitted that she had had a very unhappy childhood and she gave an account of three traumatic relationships. The partners of the first two relationships were said to have inflicted domestic violence or physical abuse upon her. The defendant admitted to smoking marijuana on a regular basis and drinking alcohol on almost a daily basis, and that she had led a vagrant lifestyle. Dr Iyer noted that the defendant’s condition had been complicated by substance abuse suggestive of a “Schizotypal personality” which is characterised, amongst other things, by unstable relationships and substance abuse.
	
	
	Dr Michael Harrison in his report of 13 November 2014 to Aboriginal Legal Services, stated that he had taken over the care of the defendant in 2011 that is the year before the offence. Dr Harrison said that based upon his initial consultations:
	


“…at the time I wondered whether she might have bipolar disorder or schizophrenia but could not convince myself of either diagnosis. She has been on [sic] long-term user of marijuana which can clearly cause psychosis …”


	
	Dr Harrison noted that he had in the few years prior to his report treated her with the use of Seroquel XR and subsequently with the antidepressant drug Citalopram.
	
	
	Dr Harrison in a report dated 29 December 2011 to Dr Lester in relation to Ms Blanks, recorded a past history of bipolar disorder.
	
	
	On 20 July 2009, Dr Raj Soni, Respiratory Physician, wrote to Dr Sutherland. In that report he noted that at the age of thirty the applicant had been smoking marijuana mixed with tobacco which he estimated approximated twenty cones a day. He also noted that she drank one or two glasses of wine or beer. He discussed a referral of the defendant to the Drug and Alcohol Service to wean her off marijuana.
	
	
	Dr Richard Furst, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, in his report of 18 December 2014, identified the sources of information available to him. These included the medical reports of Dr Harrison and Dr Neil Janes. He recorded the following matters in relation to the defendant’s psychiatric history.
	


“Ms Blanks was apparently exposed to domestic violence and her father’s drinking, claiming that he would ‘bash mum all the time’. Her mother later became a drinker herself.

Ms Blanks recalls feeling unhappy as a child, staying with her sister after leaving home from the age of 14‑16 years. She believes that she was depressed throughout her childhood.

Her previous relationships, including her marriage, have mostly been violent; Ms Blanks being the victim of domestic violence on numerous occasions.” (Report, p 3)


	
	He also noted that she had drunk alcohol from the age of 18 years and that she averaged 1.5 litres of wine daily and was still drinking. He also obtained a history of cannabis abuse: Report, p 3.
	
	
	Dr Furst also noted both the concerns expressed by Dr Harrison in his report of 13 November 2014 relating to the defendant’s mental health as well as the comments of Dr Iyer on assessment of the defendant on 31 May 2012 in which he had noted that the defendant had had a very unhappy childhood and was exposed to domestic violence and cannabis misuse and daily drinking of alcohol.
	
	
	Dr Hepner, Clinical Neuropsychologist, in her report of 11 May 2015, noted the history obtained by Dr Furst in relation to the defendant’s reported history of having been a victim of domestic violence during previous relationships, including her marriage. Dr Hepner expressed the opinion that the defendant had memory deficits, and probably had cognitive deficits.
	
	
	Dr Hepner also obtained a history from the defendant that her father had alcohol problems and beat her mother, and that she [the defendant] was hit by her father sometimes around the head: Report, p 3. Dr Hepner also noted that the defendant’s ex‑husband (apparently her first partner) abused alcohol and hit her and was psychologically abusive towards her: Report, p 4.
	
	
	Finally, Dr Hepner observed that the defendant stated that she had commenced drinking from the age of 14 or 15 years of age and that she said she had drank on a daily basis after her separation and divorce. On her account, in the previous five to ten years she had consumed about half a bottle of spirits and 1.5 litres of wine per day: Report, p 5.
	
	
	Dr Olav Nielssen, Forensic Psychiatrist, examined the defendant on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 9 February 2015 and provided a report dated 3 March 2015. It is noted that he obtained a history of the defendant’s childhood years. He recorded that the defendant told him that she was well cared for during her upbringing and did not report neglect or periods of trauma: Report, p 2.
	
	
	It is, however, to be noted that on the single occasion that Dr Nielssen interviewed the defendant, he observed that she was “affected by alcohol and was taking several sedative medications”. He agreed that she should undergo more detailed neuropsychological evaluation once she was free of drugs and alcohol for a period.
	
	
	However, Dr Nielssen recorded that the applicant said she had had contact with mental health services during her adult life and that she had seen a psychiatrist in Gosford who diagnosed her with schizophrenia, bipolar, depression and anxiety: Report, p 2.
	
	
	Her history of substance abuse was consistent with other recorded histories in that the defendant told him that she had been drinking alcohol from the age of 14 years and that she continued to drink “more and more”: Report, p 3.
	
	
	She also gave a history of having smoked cannabis for most of her adult life. He noted that she said that her mother was of Aboriginal heritage.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen noted “corroborative information” was provided at his interview with the defendant by the defendant’s daughter. He concluded that the diagnosis of possible substance‑related brain damage was made on the basis of the defendant’s daughter’s account of a decline in social performance and cognitive function in a pattern that would be consistent with the effects of long‑term hazardous alcohol intake: Report, p 7.
	
	
	Finally, I note that Dr Sathish Dayalan, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, in a report dated 22 April 2016, obtained a consistent psychiatric history of a violent and disruptive home environment. He noted that her father was described as a violent alcoholic who used to hit the children with rubber hoses and iron rods.
	
	
	He also obtained a consistent history of alcohol abuse and cannabis abuse as at the time of the offence. A diagnosis was made that the defendant was suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the offence. It was also noted that she had been assessed as having impairment of frontal lobe functions on the psychometric assessment. That was followed by the comment:
	


“…poor impulse control and impaired judgment are often features of frontal lobe impairment. It is likely that her mental health issues impaired her judgment at the time of the offence and ability to restrain impulsive behaviour. Her prior history of witnessing domestic violence and being a subject of domestic violence might have contributed to her behaviour at the time of the offence if there was indeed violence perpetrated by the victim towards her.”


	
	Dr Dayalan also noted that the defendant is likely to have:
	


“…a genetic predisposition to substance use disorder given both her parents and all her siblings suffer from substance use disorder. Her early traumatic experiences and disruptive environment are likely to have been contributing factors to substance use disorder and depressive symptoms.”


	
	In the Further Submissions on Behalf of the Accused, Senior Counsel for the defendant, Ms Loukas, submitted that the preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that the defendant’s upbringing was characterised by domestic violence, disruption and substance use by her family members. That background, it was submitted, was attested by three of the four experts in the case, as well as by Dr Iyer’s letter. It was further submitted the inconsistent history found in Dr Nielssen’s report should be viewed in light of the defendant’s reluctance to divulge information about her personal history and the limitation on Dr Nielssen’s report given that the defendant was stated to be under the influence of alcohol and sedatives when interviewed. I accept those submissions.
	


Self-Induced Intoxication


	
	Under s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the self-induced intoxication of the defendant at the time the offence is committed, is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor. See also s 428A of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence that the defendant was substantially affected by alcohol and was intoxicated on the day of the stabbing incident. In my judgment of 1 April 2016, I stated that I accepted the Crown’s submission that this was a case involving self-induced intoxication which is not to be taken into account in accordance with the provisions of s 428E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	However, it remains for me in determining the limiting term to be imposed whether the evidence establishes more than mere self-induced intoxication on the day of the offence. I raised this question with counsel and have had the benefit of their submissions directed to that issue.
	
	
	I have earlier referred to the medical histories which I accept. Those histories establish that the defendant was herself a victim of domestic violence, in particular, during her childhood at the hands of her father, and, subsequently, during the course of her first two relationships during which, I accept, she was subject to violence by her first two partners in accordance with the history that she has provided to examining medical practitioners. On the medical evidence, the personal violence to which she was exposed has a causal connection with her abuse of alcohol and cannabis.
	
	
	On sentencing it is necessary to take into account the relevant background history of violence as a mitigating factor in determining sentence. In Bugmy v R (2013) 249 CLR 571, the High Court referred to the principles that were articulated by Wood J (as his Honour then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. The High Court referred to those principles with approval. French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ observed:
	


“The proposition stated in Fernando are largely directed to the significance of the circumstances that the offender was intoxicated at the time of the offence. As Wood J explained, drunkenness does not usually operate by way of excuse or to mitigate an offender’s conduct. However, his Honour recognised that there are aboriginal communities in which alcohol abuse and alcohol‑related violence go hand in hand. His Honour considered that where an offender’s abuse of alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he or she was raised it should be taken into account as a mitigating factor …” (at [38])


	
	The medical evidence in my opinion establishes, as I have stated, that the defendant was exposed to domestic violence over many years and that her alcohol/substance disorder has resulted in cognitive impairments. In accordance with accepted sentencing principles, the defendant’s mental and psychiatric condition at the time of the offence must be taken into account, inter alia, in determining the nature and level of the defendant’s culpability. So also in some cases where drug addiction gives rise to impulsivity or disorder in thought processes, or where addiction is not a matter of personal choice but is due to circumstances for which an offender is not primarily responsible: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273] per Wood CJ at CL. Such circumstances, in my opinion, apply in the present case.
	
	
	The critical question is what limiting term is required to reflect the objective and subjective facts. The sentencing exercise must, as I have earlier stated, take into account the objective gravity of the offence, involving as it did the loss of a human life, as well as the circumstances of the defendant.
	
	
	The defendant is to be sentenced for involuntary manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. In many cases an unlawful and dangerous act occurs in the context of alcohol fuelled violence often by young men. General deterrence has particular application in sentencing in such cases. As I will shortly discuss, the defendant in this case is not in that category. Whilst she was affected by alcohol at the time of stabbing the deceased, the medical evidence establishes that she suffered from cognitive and psychological dysfunction due to her chronic alcohol/drug disorder and this must be taken into account.
	
	
	In determining sentence I must also bring into account the purposes of sentencing which under s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 include:
	


(a)   to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b)   to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c)   to protect the community from the offender,

(d)   to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e)   to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f)   to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g)   to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.


	
	I must also take into account the relevant aggravating and mitigating circumstances under s 21A of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	In the present case, Ms Loukas’ submission accepted that the use of a knife and the associated violence is a relevant factor in the objective circumstances of the case and bears upon the objective seriousness of the offence. That said, however, they are not to be additionally brought into account as aggravating factors under s 21A(2)(b), (c).
	
	
	In terms of objective seriousness, the most serious feature of the defendant’s actions, of course, is her killing of the deceased in the circumstances which include the fact that the offence, as I have stated, was an intentional but spontaneous act, not a planned act.
	
	
	I also take into account that the defendant has not displayed remorse or accepted responsibility for the offence so this is not a case where that operates as a relevant mitigating factor under s 21A(3). However, that said, her lack of remorse may well have a relationship to the impairment in her cognitive processes as discussed by Dr Hepner in her neuropsychological assessment report and by Dr Dayalan.
	
	
	The Crown in oral submissions appropriately acknowledged that the defendant has a diagnosis of a substance abuse disorder with possible substance abuse brain damage and a possible underlying psychiatric illness: T 9. The psychiatric illness, the Crown submitted, was less of a problem than the substance abuse disorder. The Crown, however, submitted that in accordance with s 428E of the Crimes Act 1900, self-induced intoxication may not be taken into account. The medical evidence that establishes a substance abuse disorder on the one hand, and s 428E on the other, the Crown submitted, makes for a difficult balancing exercise: T 10.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the defendant’s consumption of alcohol may well have provided the basis for the defendant’s actions in lashing out with the knife: T 10.
	
	
	As to the issue of deterrence in sentencing, the Crown submitted that the defendant’s mental disorder should be classified as of moderate severity which would moderate the need for general and specific deterrence but does not negate it entirely. I accept that submission.
	
	
	Also related to the issue of the defendant’s mental/psychiatric condition is the need, as I have earlier indicated, to bring into account the protection of the community as an important consideration. The level of danger which a mentally ill offender presents to the community, it has been recognised, is a countervailing consideration to all other relevant sentencing principles: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; Courtney v R (2007) 172 A Crim R 371 at [26], [59], [83]; Agha v R [2008] NSWCCA 153 at [24]. I consider the defendant’s rehabilitation prospects to be limited, and dependent upon her abstinence from alcohol and prohibited drugs.
	
	
	I received Victim Impact Statements from the deceased’s mother, Margaret MacDonald, dated 14 April 2016 and the sister of the deceased, Larica MacDonald, dated 24 April 2016. These statements were read in Court. They are deeply moving, expressing their grief and the impact upon them, and family members, of the death of Shayne MacDonald, and the pain and loss which they will, unfortunately, continue to experience.
	
	
	The tragic loss of the life of Shayne MacDonald is, of course, an immense loss. The Victim Impact Statements are expressed in dignified and clear terms. Their significance is, of course, to be fully acknowledged. I express my deepest sympathy to Mr MacDonald’s family on their sad loss. Whilst acknowledging and having had regard to the Victim Impact Statements and the provisions of s 28(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I consider that the limiting term to be imposed should be made only on the basis of the evidence before the Court and the findings made on the evidence.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence, it is clear, in my opinion, that the intentional dangerous and unlawful act of the defendant in her use of the knife in stabbing the deceased in the course of an argument was, as earlier stated, an unplanned act of a spontaneous, impulsive nature. The nature of the stabbing incident accordingly does not exhibit the level of culpability associated with a planned knife attack upon a victim. As well as the nature of the act, there must also be taken into account, as I have indicated, that the defendant’s intoxicated condition at the time she stabbed the deceased was causally related to her chronic alcohol/drug disorder. The medical evidence, in turn, links that disorder to the defendant’s dysfunctional personal life marked, as I accept it was, by a history of domestic violence. When all such matters are taken into account, I consider that the offence of manslaughter, as found on the limited evidence available, to be towards the lower end of the range of culpability for offences of that kind.
	
	
	The Crown on sentencing in its written submissions provided references to “similar cases” at [33]-[37] to which I have had regard.
	
	
	I am satisfied that if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings, in terms of s 23(1)(a) of the MH (FP) Act, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.
	
	
	Taking all the circumstances into account, in my opinion the appropriate limiting term is 5 years, commencing on 1 April 2016. Pursuant to s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the defendant is referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
	


Order

(1)   A limiting term of 5 years is nominated to date from 1 April 2016.

(2)   Pursuant to s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the defendant is referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

(3)   The defendant is to be held in custody in an appropriate institution until further assessment by the Tribunal.

2701544,Nationwide News Pty Limited v Qaumi [2016] NSWCCA 97,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Criminal proceedings were brought in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which various accused were charged with offences committed in the context of a “turf war” between two rival criminal groups known as the Brothers for Life Blacktown and the Brothers for Life Bankstown. The first to fifth respondents were charged with serious offences including murder and conspiracy to murder. The murder victims were Mahmoud Hamzy and Joseph Antoun.

On 3 February 2016, the primary judge, Hamill J, ordered that certain counts be severed from the indictment. The effect of those orders was that the charges relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun were to be heard separately from the charges relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. Hamill J directed that the trial of the charges relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun (the Antoun murder trial) was to proceed immediately upon the completion of the trial relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy (the Hamzy murder trial).

On 24 March 2016, Hamill J made an order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (Suppression Act) prohibiting publication of the evidence and submissions in the Hamzy murder trial. The order was to operate throughout the Commonwealth, and until the conclusion of the Antoun murder trial. On the same day, Hamill J made orders directing certain media entities to remove specified articles from their respective websites.

Nationwide News Pty Ltd and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation sought leave to appeal from the orders made by the primary judge and also sought an extension of time in which to bring their appeal.

The essential issue on the appeal in respect of the non-publication order was whether the orders made by the primary judge were “necessary” within the meaning of the Suppression Act, s 8. In particular, whether, and if so, in what circumstances, a total prohibition on reporting of a criminal trial until a second related trial is heard and determined will ever be appropriate.

The issue raised on the appeal in respect of the take-down orders was whether such orders can be made on the sole basis that a juror might defy a trial judge’s direction not to conduct Internet searches. The media parties contended that the take-down orders required the removal of archived material in circumstances where similar material was available elsewhere on the Internet.

The Court (Bathurst CJ, Beazley P and Hoeben CJ at CL):

(1)   Where orders are made under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) in the context of a criminal trial, an appeal properly lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal as the Court from which an appeal would lie against a final judgment of the Supreme Court in its criminal jurisdiction. The appeal is by way of hearing de novo. [14]

Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim at [6]-[7] per Bathurst CJ; Hamzy v R [2013] NSWCCA 156 at [36] per Hoeben CJ at CL; and at [63] per Beech-Jones J.

(2)   By virtue of s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), the only grounds upon which an order may be made under the Act are those specified in s 8(1). [20]

(3)   It is sufficient that the order is “necessary” to achieve one of the objectives identified in paras (a)-(e) of subs 8(1), although in a particular case, the making of an order may be necessary for more than one of the objectives specified in the paragraphs of the subsection. [20]

(4)   The word “necessary” is a strong word, and indicates a legislative intention that orders should only be made in exceptional circumstances. It will not suffice that the order is convenient, reasonable or sensible, or serves some general notion of public interest. [22], [24]

   Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 at [27], [31]

(5)   Section 6 requires a court, in determining whether to make an order, to take into account the public interest in open justice as a primary objective of the administration of justice. Except to the extent that orders can only be made on the grounds specified in s 8(1)(a)-(e), the Act does not otherwise identify or preclude from consideration other objectives of the administration of justice. [19].

(6)   Open justice is of fundamental importance in the administration of justice in the Australian legal system. However, there are other fundamental principles underlying the proper administration of justice in Australia, including the right to a fair trial. In some circumstances, those principles come into conflict. [22]-[36]

Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 at [39]; John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [17], [21]-[22]; Maevo v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 at 481; X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29 at [37], [89].

In relation to the non-publication orders:

(7)   In an exceptional case, an order prohibiting publication of the evidence and submissions in a criminal trial until the conclusion of a second related trial may be necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice or for a public interest that significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice. [62]-[77]

   John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [59].

(8)   Delaying the second related trial may not be sufficient to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice. It is essential that persons charged with criminal offences have those charges determined as early as is possible in the criminal justice system. Persons should not be denied their liberty for lengthy periods pending trial. [77]

(9)   It is fundamental that witnesses give their evidence, not only untrammelled by threats should they do so, but as soon as possible so as to protect the integrity of the evidence, which may not only be infected by fear of personal danger, but by the normal human processes of fading memory. [65], [68], [77]

(10)   The use of pseudonym orders may not be sufficient to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice. This may be the case where there are unique identifying features with the potential to infect the potential jury pool summonsed for the second trial. [70]-[72]

In relation to the take-down orders:

(11)   An order will fail the test of necessity if it is futile. However, inability to take-down all offending material, or the mere fact that material is on overseas websites, will not necessarily mean that a take-down order would be futile. [83]

   Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 293 ALR 384 at [76]; R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1102 at [44].

(12)   Evidence that the take-down of one item had some effect in reducing the information available on the internet will not preclude a finding of futility. An order may be futile where the court is not satisfied it would result in materials being sufficiently removed from the internet. [89]-[90]

(13)   A trial judge is able to give directions to a jury that they must determine the matter on the evidence before the Court. The received wisdom of the courts, having conducted jury trials over the years, is that juries act responsibly and in accordance with their oath, including in complying with the directions of the trial judge. [90]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: There are presently before the Supreme Court of New South Wales criminal proceedings in which the first to fifth respondents are charged with serious offences including murder and conspiracy to murder. The murder victims were Mahmoud Hamzy and Joseph Antoun.
	
	
	On 3 February 2016, Hamill J ordered that certain counts be severed from the indictment: R v Qaumi (No 3) (Severance and separate trial) [2016] NSWSC 15 (the severance judgment). The effect of those orders was that the charges relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun were to be heard separately from the charges relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. Hamill J directed that the trial of the charges relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun (the Antoun murder trial) was to proceed immediately upon the completion of the trial relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy (the Hamzy murder trial): the severance judgment at [145]. This direction has been referred to in the proceedings as the “back-to-back trial direction” and it is convenient to continue to use that description.
	
	
	On 24 March 2016, Hamill J, on the application of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi, made an order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (the Suppression Act) prohibiting publication of the evidence and submissions in the Hamzy murder trial. That order continues until the conclusion of the Antoun murder trial: R v Qaumi (No 15) (Non-publication order) [2016] NSWSC 318 (the non-publication judgment).
	
	
	The orders made by his Honour were as follows:
	


“(1)   Publication of the evidence and submissions in the present trial is prohibited until the occurrence of one of the events specified in order (2) on the grounds that (a) the orders is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice and (e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

(2)   For the purpose of s 12 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) the order is continued until the conclusion of the trial of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi in relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun (‘the Antoun trial’), or until any order is made under s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that the Antoun trial is to be tried by judge alone, or until further order.

(3)   Pursuant to s 11 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), the order applies throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.”


	
	On the same day, on the application of Jamil Qaumi, his Honour made orders directing certain media entities to remove certain specified articles from their respective websites: R v Qaumi (No 16) (Internet “take down” orders) [2016] NSWSC 319 (the take down judgment).
	
	
	Nationwide News Pty Limited (Nationwide News) and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation sought leave to appeal from the orders made by the primary judge in respect of each application under the Suppression Act, s 14 and also sought an extension of time in which to bring the appeal. Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited, which was also an intervener in the applications, did not join in either appeal.
	
	
	The active respondents on the appeal were Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and the Crown. Jamil Qaumi adopted the submissions advanced by Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi. The legal representatives for the respondents Mohammad Zarshoy and Mohammad Kalal were present in court, but did not separately advance any argument on the appeal.
	
	
	Leave to appeal, which was not opposed, should be granted. The appeal raised important questions in relation to the principles of open justice and the right of an accused person to a trial according to law. In particular, it raised for consideration and determination the circumstances in which, if ever, it will be necessary to prohibit the reporting of a trial until a second related trial, listed to be heard following the conclusion of the first trial, has been heard and determined. For the same reason, and as no question of prejudice to the respondents has been raised, an extension of time should be granted.
	


Relevant background


	
	The background to the relevant criminal proceedings has been explained in the various interlocutory judgments of the primary judge in this matter. On the original indictment before Hamill J, there were 36 counts relating to eight accused. Of those accused, Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammad Zarshoy have been charged with the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi have also been charged with conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy. Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi have been charged with the murder of Joseph Antoun.
	
	
	Other charges relating to the possession and discharge of firearms, shooting at persons with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, extortion or intimidation offences, and charges relating to drug supply have been brought against various accused. Each accused is also charged with an offence of participating in a criminal group. In the non-publication judgment, Hamill J, at [14], referred to the charges as having arisen in the context of “a ‘turf war’ between two rival criminal groups known as the Brothers for Life Blacktown … and the Brothers for Life Bankstown”.
	
	
	Some of the charges are being heard as part of the Hamzy murder trial and any reference to that trial hereafter in these reasons should be taken to include those additional matters. The Hamzy murder trial, which is presently proceeding before the primary judge, is expected to proceed for a period of approximately 4-6 months. The Antoun murder trial, which has been directed to proceed at the conclusion of the Hamzy murder trial, is expected to take approximately 2 months.
	


Issues on the appeal


	
	The essential issue on the appeal in respect of the non-publication order was whether the orders made by the primary judge were “necessary” within the meaning of the Suppression Act, s 8. In particular, the appellants raised for consideration the question whether, and if so, in what circumstances, a total prohibition on reporting of a criminal trial until a second related trial is heard and determined will ever be appropriate: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [59]. The appellants emphasised the interest of the community in being informed of the proceedings, including matters that emerged from the evidence, involving as they did, serious gang-related crime. The appellants’ underlying complaint was that as a result of the non-publication order, evidence and submissions in the Hamzy murder trial cannot be published until the Antoun murder trial is concluded, a period in excess of 6 months.
	
	
	The issue raised on the appeal in respect of the “take down” orders was whether such orders can be made on the sole basis that a juror might defy a trial judge’s direction not to conduct Internet searches. A question was also raised as to the correctness of the approach taken in R v Debs [2011] NSWSC 1248 and R v Perish; R v Lawton; R v Perish [2011] NSWSC 1102. The appellants’ essential complaint was that the “take down” orders required the media to remove archived material in circumstances where similar material is available elsewhere on the Internet.
	
	
	One further matter should be mentioned at the outset. A question arose as to the source of the appellants’ right to appeal and the proper jurisdiction in which to bring that appeal. The Court is satisfied that an appeal lies to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to the Suppression Act, s 14. The appeal is by way of hearing de novo: Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim at [6]-[7] per Bathurst CJ; Hamzy v R [2013] NSWCCA 156 at [36] per Hoeben CJ at CL; and at [63] per Beech-Jones J. The Court permitted affidavit evidence to be read on the appeal on condition that there be no cross-examination.
	


Legislation


	
	The Suppression Act is an Act to provide for the making of suppression and non-publication orders by courts. The Act does not limit or otherwise affect any inherent jurisdiction or powers that the court may have to regulate its own proceedings or to deal with a contempt of the court apart from the Act: s 4.
	
	
	The sections of the Act relevant to the appeal are ss 3, 6, 7 and 8. Those sections provide:
	


“3   Definitions

In this Act:

court means:

(a)   the Supreme Court, Land and Environment Court, Industrial Court, District Court, Local Court or Children’s Court, or

(b)   any other court or tribunal, or a person or body having power to act judicially, prescribed by the regulations as a court for the purposes of this Act.

information includes any document.

news media organisation means a commercial enterprise that engages in the business of broadcasting or publishing news or a public broadcasting service that engages in the dissemination of news through a public news medium.

non-publication order means an order that prohibits or restricts the publication of information (but that does not otherwise prohibit or restrict the disclosure of information).

party to proceedings includes the complainant or victim (or alleged victim) in criminal proceedings and any person named in evidence given in proceedings and, in relation to proceedings that have concluded, means a person who was a party to the proceedings before the proceedings concluded.

proceedings means civil or criminal proceedings.

publish means disseminate or provide access to the public or a section of the public by any means, including by:

(a)   publication in a book, newspaper, magazine or other written publication, or

(b)   broadcast by radio or television, or

(c)   public exhibition, or

(d)   broadcast or publication by means of the Internet.

suppression order means an order that prohibits or restricts the disclosure of information (by publication or otherwise).

…

6   Safeguarding public interest in open justice

In deciding whether to make a suppression order or non-publication order, a court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.

7   Power to make orders

A court may, by making a suppression order or non-publication order on grounds permitted by this Act, prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of:

(a)   information tending to reveal the identity of or otherwise concerning any party to or witness in proceedings before the court or any person who is related to or otherwise associated with any party to or witness in proceedings before the court, or

(b)   information that comprises evidence, or information about evidence, given in proceedings before the court.

8   Grounds for making an order

(1)   A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:

(a)   the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,

(b)   the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security,

(c)   the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,

(d)   the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency),

(e)   it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

(2)   A suppression order or non-publication order must specify the ground or grounds on which the order is made.”


	
	Thus, the scheme of the Act provides by way of the interrelated provisions of ss 6, 7 and 8 for the circumstances in which a court may make an order to supress or prohibit publication of court proceedings.
	
	
	Section 7 confers upon a court power to make an order that prohibits or restrains the disclosure of the two categories of information identified in paras (a) and (b) of the section.
	
	
	Section 6 requires a court, in determining whether to make an order, to take into account the public interest in open justice as a primary objective of the administration of justice. Except to the extent that orders can only be made on the grounds specified in s 8(1)(a)-(e), the Act does not otherwise identify or preclude from consideration other objectives of the administration of justice. Nor, save to the extent that it provides that open justice is one of the primary principles in the administration of justice, does it establish a hierarchy of objectives.
	
	
	By virtue of s 7, the only grounds upon which an order may be made under the Act are those specified in s 8(1). Section 8(1) requires that the order made must be “necessary” to achieve the objective identified in the relevant subparagraph. It is sufficient that the order is “necessary” to achieve one of the objectives identified in paras (a)-(e) of subs 8(1), although in a particular case, the making of an order may be necessary for more than one of the matters specified in the paragraphs of the subsection.
	
	
	The primary judge made orders pursuant to s 8(1)(a) and (e).
	


Case law

Meaning of “necessary” in s 8(1)


	
	In Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403, at [27], Bathurst CJ and McColl JA, in considering the background to the introduction of the Act, explained the meaning of “necessary” in s 8 as follows:
	


“The operative condition for making a suppression order under s 8 of the CSPO Act is that it be ‘necessary’ to do so, which ‘... is a strong word [which, in] collocation [with] necessity to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice ... ‘suggests Parliament was not dealing with trivialities’ ’: Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21; (2010) 240 CLR 651 (at [30]). The observations in Hogan v Australian Crime Commission were made in relation to a legislative scheme which, while it required the jurisdiction of the Court to be exercised in open court (s 17, Federal Court of Australia Act) did not contain a provision in like terms to s 6 of the CSPO Act. That provision, in our view, reinforces the legislative intention that CSPO Act orders should only be made in exceptional circumstances, a position which prevailed at common law: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of NSW (at [21]).” (emphasis added)


	
	Bathurst CJ and McColl JA observed, at [28], that “necessity” was the test that had been applied by the courts in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to make non-publication orders: see John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW. Their Honours observed, at [29], that the clearest statement that the test for making a suppression order or non-publication order under the inherent jurisdiction was one of “necessity”, was to be found in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal (NSW) (1985) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476-477. That passage, which was cited with approval in Hogan v Hinch [2010] HCA 21; 240 CLR 651 at [21], is set out below. As their Honours’ reasons also demonstrate, the requirement of necessity as the test for making any order that impinges upon the rule of open justice has a long history: see R v Macfarlane; Ex parte O’Flanagan and O’Kelly [1923] HCA 39; 32 CLR 518 at 549, cited with approval by the plurality in Hogan v Hinch at [87].
	
	
	Their Honours further noted, at [31], that it was not sufficient, to satisfy the test of necessity, that an order be “convenient, reasonable or sensible, or serve some notion of the public interest”. Their Honours pointed out that there was no question of engaging in a “balancing exercise”: see Hogan v Hinch at [31].
	
	
	In Macfarlane; Ex parte O’Flanagan and O’Kelly, Isaacs J observed, at 549:
	


“The final and paramount consideration in all cases is that emphasized in Scott v. Scott, namely, ‘to do justice’ (Viscount Haldane L.C.). All other considerations are means to that end. They are ancillary principles and rules. Some of them are so deeply embedded in our law as to be elementary and axiomatic, others closely approach that position. Of the latter class is publicity, which can only be disregarded where necessity compels departure, for otherwise justice would be denied to those whom Earl Loreburn termed ‘the parties entitled to justice.’” (footnotes omitted)


	
	In John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal (NSW), McHugh JA (Glass JA agreeing) stated, at 476-477:
	


“The fundamental rule of the common law is that the administration of justice must take place in open court. A court can only depart from this rule where its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule … an order of a court prohibiting the publication of evidence is only valid if it is really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in proceedings before it. Moreover, an order prohibiting publication of evidence must be clear in its terms and do no more than is necessary to achieve the due administration of justice …” (emphasis in original)

Meaning of “the administration of justice”


	
	In the present case, the primary judge founded his non-publication order, inter alia, on para (a), namely, that the order was necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. In Rinehart v Welker, Bathurst CJ and McColl JA observed, at [39], that the “administration of justice” is a multi-faceted concept:
	


“As Young JA has said (at [86]) as used in s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act , ‘it is,... a reference to the public interest that the court should endeavour to achieve effectively the object for which it was appointed to do justice between the parties’: Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish (at 133) per Bowen CJ.”

Other fundamental objectives


	
	Spigelman CJ, in John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW, at [17], in describing the principle of open justice as “one of the most fundamental aspects of the system of justice in Australia”, nonetheless recognised that there were various other fundamental principles underlying the justice system, including the right of a person to a fair trial.
	
	
	The right to a fair trial has itself been described, as Spigelman CJ identified, at [22], as “the central thesis of the administration of criminal justice”; as “the central prescript of our criminal law” and as “a fundamental element” (citations omitted).
	
	
	Another aspect of the proper conduct of a criminal trial was adverted to in Maevo v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464, at 481, where Richardson J observed that:
	


“… the public interest in the due administration of justice necessarily extends to ensuring that the Court’s processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike.”


	
	His Honour also observed that there was a second aspect of the public interest, namely, “the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice”.
	


Exceptional cases


	
	In John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW, Spigelman CJ observed, at [21], that:
	


“From time to time the courts do make orders that some aspect or aspects of court proceedings not be the subject of publication. Any such order must, in the light of the principle of open justice, be regarded as exceptional. (See, e.g. Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones (1985) 2 NSWLR 47 at 50D-E and 54G.)”

His Honour acknowledged, at [17], that different fundamental principles may sometimes conflict.


	
	Spigelman CJ acknowledged, at [59], that there may be circumstances where media publicity is such that a person “will not be able to have a fair trial within a reasonable period or at all”. In such circumstances, his Honour foresaw the benefit of an “anticipatory non-publication order ... to ensure fairness to the prosecution”. Again, however, his Honour referred to that as being an “exceptional case”.
	
	
	The Chief Justice observed that such an exceptional case would be “so unlikely” that it could not form the basis for implying a power in the District Court, which, as the position pertained prior to the introduction of the Suppression Act, otherwise had no jurisdiction to make a suppression order.
	


Back-to-back trials


	
	Spigelman CJ also recognised that the difficulty caused by media publicity would arise most acutely in cases where back-to-back trials had been directed. Although his Honour did not consider that to be sufficient to justify the implication of a power, he accepted that in such cases, a suppression order could be made in the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
	
	
	In the course of his reasons Spigelman CJ observed, at [63], that there were circumstances in which back-to-back orders were desirable, having regard to “considerations such as the convenience of witnesses, the efficient deployment of prosecutorial resources, the effective management of a court’s caseload”, adding, however, that:
	


“Considerations of convenience and efficiency are a wholly inadequate basis to justify the implication of a power to prohibit publication of a verdict. If such considerations are to operate as a qualification of the principle of open justice, express statutory authority is required.”

The non-publication orders

Primary judge’s reasons


	
	The issue of the severance of the counts relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun from the indictment and the order for the separation of the two trials loomed large in the submissions on the appeal before this Court.
	
	
	In the non-publication judgment, the primary judge, at [19], explained that he had severed the Antoun murder counts “because it would be impossible for the accused to receive a fair trial if the evidence in relation to all of these matters was received by the same jury”. His Honour explained that he had taken the view that it would be impossible to fashion directions to a jury that would overcome any prejudice that would be occasioned by the Antoun murder trial proceeding alongside the Hamzy murder trial, insofar as that trial was concerned with the matters arising out of the turf war between the chapters of the Brothers for Life.
	
	
	His Honour, at [20] of the non-publication judgment, recorded the position of the respondents in seeking the suppression order which was that if the Hamzy murder trial was the subject of extensive media coverage, it would be impossible to summons a jury in the Antoun murder trial who would not be affected or influenced by knowledge of those earlier incidents. His Honour noted the argument that any media coverage would be extensive such as to render otiose the orders for severance and separation of the trials.
	
	
	In support of their application, the respondents had adduced evidence of newspaper and other media items relating to the turf war and the murders of Mahmoud Hamzy and Joseph Antoun. His Honour, at [24] of the non-publication judgment, inferred from this material the nature and extent of the media coverage that could be anticipated. His Honour accepted that “the coverage is likely to be prominent, dramatic and sustained throughout the period of the trial” and would likely be published by all forms of media and be readily available on the Internet.
	
	
	His Honour stated, at [25] of the non-publication judgment, that he was:
	


“… comfortably satisfied that in the absence of some form of restriction on publication, a large section of the public will become aware of the fact that Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi are alleged to be the leaders of Brothers For Life Blacktown, and directed the activities of that organisation …”

including activities of serious criminality, including a murder and serious woundings.


	
	His Honour considered, at [26], that:
	


“There is little doubt that if a jury trying the Antoun murder case was aware of some or all of this material, it would be inimical to the [respondent’s] right to a fair trial. It would make the orders severing the counts otiose and it would not be possible … to direct the jury in such a way as to overcome the prejudice.”


	
	It was his Honour’s view, at [72] of the non-publication judgment, that unless there was some restriction or suppression on the publication of the evidence in the Hamzy murder trial it would not be possible to proceed with the Antoun murder trial “for some significant time”. As his Honour stated, “[i]n short, it is necessary to make some form of order to protect the integrity of the Antoun murder trial”. In this regard, his Honour rejected that it was merely “convenient, reasonable or sensible” to make an order restricting publication.
	
	
	Having reached that conclusion, the question for his Honour’s determination was the form that the order ought to take, having regard to the test of necessity, which, as he noted, “remains at the forefront of consideration”, and to the need to formulate orders which would be “least intrusive upon the public interest in open justice”. His Honour then considered the various alternative orders that might be made.
	
	
	His Honour, at [73]ff, rejected as an alternative to a non-publication order, a proposal by the appellants that there be a delay before the Antoun murder trial proceed. In his Honour’s view, as expressed at [74], there were victims and informant witnesses who had an expectation that the Antoun murder trial proceed as soon as possible. His Honour considered that Joseph Antoun’s family and friends were entitled to see those charged with his murder brought to trial in a timely fashion, having particular regard to the impact that his murder had had upon family, including those who were present when the killing occurred.
	
	
	His Honour, at [75] of the non-publication judgment, referred to the position of five informant witnesses who are to give evidence in both trials. Hamill J noted, at [75], that “[t]he longer that the case remains before the Court, the longer these witnesses will remain the focus of attention, with the consequent danger to them”. In this regard, the Court was informed during the course of argument on the appeal that his Honour had heard evidence on the voir dire that 13 informant witnesses had each made statements to the police indicating their fears about being required to give evidence in open court. His Honour had earlier rejected an application that those witnesses give their evidence by video link, because of the fears the witnesses held for their personal safety. That is not a matter in issue in the matter with which this Court is presently dealing. What is of relevance here is that there was evidence before his Honour of the fear of danger held by these witnesses.
	
	
	At [76], his Honour stated that the accused were also entitled to have their trial heard and determined in a timely fashion. As his Honour noted, the respondents had been in custody since 8 January 2014 on remand, bail refused, awaiting trial for charges to which each had entered a plea of not guilty.
	
	
	His Honour concluded, at [77], that postponing the Antoun trial in order to give effect to the public interest in open justice was not an appropriate solution.
	
	
	His Honour, at [78]ff, considered a number of other alternative solutions. The first was changing the venue, which was found not to be a viable option. The second was to prohibit publication until the commencement of the Antoun murder trial so that the jury selected in that trial would not be aware of pre-existing publicity. However, that solution did not deal with the concern that the media coverage of the Hamzy murder trial was likely to infect the potential jury pool for the Antoun trial. Another suggestion was to reverse the order of trials, but that was found to be impracticable.
	
	
	A further alternative, most favoured by the media interests in the hearing before his Honour, was that there be non-publication of the identities of the accused or that they be identified by pseudonym. His Honour considered this alternative at [83]ff. In doing so, his Honour noted that he had invited counsel for Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi to draft appropriate orders but that they had been unable to do so. The impediment to their successfully doing so, it seemed was because, as Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi had submitted, there were “so many unique identifiers which, even if there was a suppression order, a jury would very easily be able to connect the two trials”.
	
	
	His Honour concluded, at [87]-[89]:
	


“87   Having considered the matter, including possible alternative orders, at some length, I find myself accepting the submission made by Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi. In both trials, witness L, and other witnesses to be called by the Crown, are expected to give evidence relating to the background circumstances and their involvement with the Qaumi brothers. This evidence will be elicited to explain why they conducted themselves in the way that they did. A significant part of the Crown case against Farhad Qaumi in both trials will be the evidence of a number of witnesses who (it is anticipated) will say that he used evidence, threats and intimidation to ensure that they obeyed directions. A number of specific incidents will be relied on. As between the two trials, there is a commonality of the evidence and the incidents to which that evidence relates. It is impossible to imagine that the common features of that testimony would not be obvious to any member of the jury pool summoned in the Antoun trial.

88   It is, in my assessment, impossible to predict in advance (and then to particularise and formulate an order) the precise content of each and every item of evidence that might lead a potential juror to realise that the two men said to have ordered the execution of Mr Antoun were also the leaders of the group of men subject to the twenty or so allegations in the first trial.

89   For these reasons, I have concluded that it is not feasible to fashion orders that would be effective in hiding the identity of the two accused. If such orders were possible, it would not be necessary to make an order prohibiting (or, more correctly, postponing) publication of the evidence and submissions in the present trial. If my ultimate conclusion is wrong, I would certainly have been persuaded that some form of order designed to suppress the identity of the accused and links between the two trials should be made.”

Appellants’ submissions


	
	The appellants contended that his Honour, in determining that it was necessary that a non-publication order be made, had in effect inverted the decision-making process. As the argument went, his Honour proceeded on the basis that a non-publication order was necessary to protect the efficacy of, and reason for, the direction that the two trials proceed back-to-back. The appellants contended that the risk of prejudice to the Antoun murder trial from publicity in respect of the Hamzy murder trial had, in fact, been created by the court’s own “case management” order. The appellants contended that the “key error” was that his Honour treated that listing as immovable.
	
	
	The appellants further complained that no reasons were ever given for the direction that the trials be held back-to-back until his Honour gave reasons in the non-publication judgment at [74]-[76]. On the appellants’ argument, prejudice to the Antoun murder trial from media coverage of the Hamzy trial could be overcome by the Antoun proceedings being heard at a later date.
	
	
	This led to the appellants’ next submission, namely that his Honour had erred in finding that the non-publication order was necessary. This formed one aspect of the challenge to his Honour’s findings at [24] which, the appellants contended, contained two fundamental errors of principle. The first was that his Honour erred in relation to the test of necessity. In this regard the appellants submitted that the test of “necessity” is not informed by what is reasonable, sensible, or in service to some notion of the public interest: Hogan v Australian Crimes Commission [2010] HCA 21 at [30]-[31]. Nor was a mere belief of necessity sufficient: John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal at 476-477. These submissions also formed the basis of the challenge to his Honour’s so called retrospective reasoning at [74]-[76] to support the order for separate trials.
	
	
	The appellants submitted that the test of necessity could only be satisfied if supported by cogent and clear evidence filed in support of the relevant application: Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim at [8] and [49]-[51]; Rinehart v Welker at [29]; John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal at 476-477. The appellants contended that the evidence upon which his Honour relied raised, at most, a ‘fear’ of prejudice. They further argued that, his Honours satisfaction, expressed at [25], was not supported by evidence but appeared to have been based upon a submission of the Crown prosecutor, recorded in the non-publication judgment at [55]. The appellants contended that that submission was itself unsupported by any evidence.
	
	
	The appellants also challenged the relevance of his Honour’s reasoning at [53] of the non-publication judgment in distinguishing John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW as relating to the implied powers of the District Court whilst overlooking the point made by Spigelman CJ, at [38] of that judgment, that for practical purposes the test of necessity applied equally to the implication of a power for a statutory court and to the exercise of an inherent power in a superior court.
	
	
	The second alleged fundamental error, according to the appellants, was that his Honour’s conclusion, that any prejudice could not be appropriately accommodated and managed by directions to the jury, flew in the face of the long-established presumption that juries listen to and abide by directions that they are to determine the guilt of the accused solely on the evidence before them: Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim. The appellants contended that his Honour’s conclusion reflected “mere conjecture or speculation”, an approach criticised by Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 603, and cited by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW at [104].
	


Respondents’ submissions


	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi emphasised the following matters as underpinning the correctness of his Honour’s decision. First, the statements of the witnesses received by his Honour on the voir dire, which provided evidence of the danger to those witness; secondly, the fact that his Honour had sentenced Witness L. Witness L was involved in the shooting of Mahmoud Hamzy and was the person who, on the Crown case, shot Joseph Antoun. On the sentence hearing of Witness L, the primary judge had heard evidence from the family of Joseph Antoun and accepted that it was in the interests of the family to have the matter resolved as soon as possible.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi submitted that, contrary to the appellants’ submission, his Honour had not treated the back-to-back listing as immovable, as was apparent from the fact that he considered various alternative orders that might be made, but found them to be inadequate to protect the integrity of the Antoun murder trial.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi also repeated the submission that he had made to the primary judge that the use of pseudonyms would be insufficient because there were too many unique identifying features between the two trials. Those identifying features were: all the accused were at some stage members of the Blacktown chapter of Brothers for Life; nearly all of the accused were of Afghani descent; three of the accused are brothers; two live on the Central Coast; there were a number of witnesses to both trials and, in particular, Witness L was a significant participant in each of the murders; and a crucial witness in each case is a single woman of Western European or Anglo origin and there would be evidence that she had a relationship with the third respondent, Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	Senior counsel submitted that there were additional factors relevant to identifying the two trials as being connected. These included that the Hamzy murder trial is being conducted at the Downing Centre in what is considered to be the only relevantly secure court in which to so. It is likely that the Antoun murder trial will be conducted in the same court and by the same judge. Senior Counsel also relied on the position that attempts at fashioning orders to achieve a result less than total prohibition on reporting had not proved to be feasible.
	


Consideration


	
	We have set out above statements of principle in the case law as to the fundamental importance of open justice in the administration of justice in the Australian legal system. However, open justice is not the only fundamental principle that needs to be recognised and protected as an aspect of the proper administration of justice. There are others. Critical to this case is the fundamental right of a person to a fair trial. As French CJ and Crennan J stated in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29 at [37]:
	


“Relevant authorities have given context to the concept and importance of the right of every accused person to a fair and impartial trial according to law. Although Deane J pointed out in Jago that an accused’s right to a fair trial is more accurately expressed in negative terms as a right not to be tried unfairly or as an immunity against conviction otherwise than after a fair trial, for no person can enforce a right to be tried by the state, ‘it is convenient, and not unduly misleading, to refer to an accused's positive right to a fair trial’.” (citations omitted)


	
	Hayne and Bell JJ, at [89], considered that the question to ask in determining whether a person has had a fair trial, is “whether the accused has had, or will have, a trial according to law”.
	
	
	What it means to have a fair trial has been considered in recent cases in the context of the accusatorial process by which criminal trials are conducted in this country. In that regard, the High Court has referred to the principle that “the onus of proof rests on the prosecution, whom the accused is not required to assist”: Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39 at [125].
	
	
	However, it is to be remembered that the right of an accused person to a fair trial, in the sense of a trial according to law including that the onus rests on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused, is not merely a personal right residing in an accused person. Whilst that is a fundamental aspect of the administration of justice, there are other fundamental interests in play. As we have already stated, open justice is one such interest. Another is that witnesses must be free to give evidence without being subject to the threat of violence or having a reasonably based fear of violence. This is essential to the “maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice”: see above at [31] per Richardson J in Maevo. Indeed, this aspect of the administration of justice finds expression in the provisions of the criminal law: see, for example, the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 315A, which provides for a penalty of 7 years imprisonment for threatening or intimidating victims or witnesses.
	
	
	It was not argued in this case that it was inappropriate to anonymise the identity of witnesses by the use of pseudonyms. There was a clear recognition of the need to protect the identity of witnesses, some of whom are informers and some of whom are victims. Nor was it in dispute that the principle of open justice is fundamental to the proper administration of justice. Rather, the challenge was to whether the non-publication order made by his Honour was “necessary”.
	
	
	We do not accept the appellants’ submission that the consequence of the back-to-back order was to invert the decision making process so that the non-publication order was, in effect, driven by or made inevitable because of the prejudice to the accused in the Antoun murder trial. Leaving aside any other matter, his Honour, in the non-publication judgment, gave express consideration to delaying the hearing of the Antoun murder trial. However, in a finding not challenged by the appellants, his Honour considered that if that approach was taken, the Antoun murder trial would have to be delayed for a considerable period in order to ensure that the fairness of the trial was not prejudiced by media coverage of the Hamzy murder trial. His Honour considered that that was not feasible, for the reasons he gave at [74]-[76], to which we have referred above at [44]-[47].
	
	
	Contrary to the appellants’ submission that there was no evidence, the consideration his Honour gave to the position of the victims and the informant witnesses was supported by the evidence on the voir dire to which we have referred. Having regard to that evidence, his Honour’s finding at [75] that “[t]he longer that the case remains before the Court, the longer these witnesses will remain the focus of attention, with the consequent danger to them” was an available and indeed obvious inference.
	
	
	Apart from the third and fifth proposals, the appellants did not suggest that any of the other alternatives that his Honour considered were practical orders that could be made to protect the integrity of the trial process.
	
	
	The third proposal was that there be an order prohibiting publication of the Antoun murder trial until the trial commences, coupled with an order that the names of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi not appear in the court list other than by the use of pseudonyms. The appellants’ argument, made to his Honour and to this Court was that the third proposal would be sufficient as it would ensure there was no publicity of the Antoun murder trial until such time as the jury had been empanelled and was in the control of the court. At that time, the jury would be subject to the trial judge’s directions. Those directions would include that they must only determine the case on the basis of the evidence.
	
	
	The appellants recognised that because the evidence in the Antoun murder trial would cover some of the same evidence as adduced in the Hamzy murder trial, then, on the premise that there would be publicity of the Hamzy murder trial, jurors in the Antoun murder trial may recognise that Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi had been involved in the earlier trial. They submitted, however, that any such recognition would not occur until some time into the trial and again, the jurors would be expected to act on the directions given by the trial judge.
	
	
	Although the courts, in the administration of justice, place great store in the integrity of the jury system, including that jurors will act on the directions given by the trial judge, the appellants’ response does not deal with the concern raised by the trial judge as to the effect of publicity on the pool of potential jurors. The difficulty that was of concern to his Honour was with summonsing a jury, not with the manner in which the jury would be expected to carry out their functions. As his Honour pointed out, the third proposal failed to deal with the concern that the Hamzy murder trial would attract significant media publicity which was “likely to infect the potential jury pool summonsed for the Antoun [murder] trial”. This was because there were too many unique identifiers linking the two trials. We consider that the reasons his Honour gave for rejecting the third proposal were cogent and we agree with them.
	
	
	The appellants also maintained the fifth proposal they had advanced below that a pseudonym order would be sufficient. They complained, however, that in the manner in which the matter had been argued below, an onus had been placed upon the media parties to formulate satisfactory orders. It was submitted that this was both erroneous and unfair. According to the appellants, this was erroneous because the media parties were not the applicants for the non-publication order and hence did not bear any onus to satisfy the court that there was some other order that could be made. It was unfair because the media parties did not have access to all the judgments in the case, which are themselves subject to non-publication orders.
	
	
	Both aspects of this submission failed to deal with two matters. The first was that, according to his Honour’s reasons at [82] fn 14, Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi had given his Honour some indication that orders might be drafted. As we understood his Honour’s reasons, no request was made or direction given to the appellants by his Honour to do so. However, that did not occur. More importantly, the submission failed to deal with the unique identifiers addressed by Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi and which his Honour accepted “inevitably link the two cases”. We agree that those identifying features are overwhelmingly of a kind such that it would be almost impossible for a person who followed the media in its various forms not to make the connection between the two trials.
	
	
	We consider, conformably with the view of the primary judge, that the fair trial of the respondents in the Antoun murder trial would be prejudiced in the absence of a non-publication order. We also agree with his Honour that there are no practical alternatives capable of ensuring that the Antoun murder trial will not be prejudiced by the media coverage of the Hamzy murder trial, and that the order for the prohibition on reporting made by his Honour is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice. We are also of the view that it is otherwise in the public interest for the order to be made and that that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice. In our opinion, this is an exceptional case in which it is necessary to make an order prohibiting publication in the terms made by his Honour.
	
	
	We also make the following additional comments. The appellants indicated that the direction that the two trials be conducted back-to-back was a matter of case management and referred to the comments of Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW to which we have referred above at [36]. Although Spigelman CJ indicated that there may be good administrative reasons why trials should be held back-to-back, the position in the present case goes well beyond administrative arrangements of court listings. The matters articulated by the primary judge at [74]-[76], set out above at [44]-[47], are matters that are fundamental to the proper administration of justice.
	
	
	In particular, it is essential that persons charged with criminal offences have those charges determined as early as is possible in the criminal justice system. Further, such persons should not be denied their liberty for lengthy periods pending trial. It is likewise fundamental that witnesses give their evidence, not only untrammelled by threats should they do so, but as soon as possible so as to protect the integrity of the evidence, which may not only be infected by fear of personal danger, but by the normal human processes of fading memory.
	


The take down orders

Primary judge’s reasons


	
	In the take down judgment, the primary judge made orders that certain articles be removed from the websites of the appellants. His Honour, at [21], accepted that the articles could be grouped into seven categories, as follows:
	


“A: Articles which published the names and other information identifying police informants.

B: Articles which connected the accused to other offences which are not to be referred to in the present trial.

C: Articles which referred to the accused Farhad Qaumi having been accused of previous murders in relation to which he was acquitted. Such evidence has been ruled to be inadmissible in the present trial: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 115.

D: Articles that referred to the accused’s bail status and criminal history and propensity for violence.

E: Articles that link to a video showing the rest of the accused.

F: Articles which provided opinions apparently emanating from senior police officers providing opinions on matters to be decided by the jury.

G: Articles which publish the name and information that might identify police informant known as witness M.”


	
	His Honour determined, at [24] of the take down judgment, that these categories, except A and G, had the capacity, to varying degrees, to influence a juror who read and digested that material, depending upon the content of individual publications. At [25], his Honour considered the material in categories B-F could be further classified into three sub-categories: first, articles referring to the alleged murder of Joseph Antoun; secondly, the article that referred to Farhad Qaumi committing previous killings; thirdly, the articles that referred, “particularly in sensationalist terms, to Mr Zarshoy’s criminal history and propensity for ‘extreme violence’”
	
	
	In determining whether to make the orders, his Honour had regard to three specific matters. First, whether it would be futile to make the orders having regard to the fact that some articles had been extensively reproduced on other websites, including on overseas websites which were beyond the reach of the jurisdiction of the court.
	
	
	Secondly, whether directions to the jury would be sufficient to avoid any prejudice that existing publicity might have on the integrity of each of the trials.
	
	
	Thirdly, the practical implications of making takedown orders, and in particular, whether by virtue of the proposed orders, the articles in question would effectively be permanently removed from the Internet because of the time and disproportionate cost of republishing the articles at the conclusion of the trials.
	


Futility and publication on overseas websites


	
	There was evidence before his Honour that some of the articles had been published on overseas websites and, in the case of one article, the website on which it was published was registered in New Zealand. The consequence was that whatever order his Honour might make, it would not be enforceable outside of Australia. In Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim, Basten JA, at [76], as the primary judge noted, had observed that an order would fail the test of necessity if it was futile, but that the mere fact that material was on overseas websites did not of itself mean that a takedown order would be futile. In Perish; Lawton at [44], Price J observed that “the inability of a court to remove all offending material does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that the provision of the relief sought would be futile”.
	
	
	His Honour also noted a submission that the owners of search engines such as Google were not represented before his Honour. However, his Honour referred to the statement of R A Hulme J in Debs, at [24], that a court is empowered by the Act to make orders without notice to all those who might be affected. Basten JA in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim, considered that this raised an issue by virtue of the fact that the Suppression Act, s 16, provides for a criminal penalty for breach of an order. Nonetheless, the primary judge, at [36] of the take down judgment, considered it relevant that there was some evidence from which it could be inferred that removal of the most potentially prejudicial articles would have the desired effect.
	
	
	His Honour was also conscious of the difficulty in determining whether an order would be futile in light of the sheer volume of data on the World Wide Web. In this regard, there was evidence before his Honour that a search of the name “Jamil Qaumi” on the Google search engine produced 33,000 results in 0.19 of a second and a similar search on the Bing search engine produced 11,500 results. His Honour observed, at [37] of the take down judgment, that to “order the ‘take down’ of some 25 articles would seem at first glanced to be merely scratching at the surface”. Nonetheless, his Honour accepted that it had been demonstrated by the removal of one of the items that there had been “some effect” in reducing the information that was readily available by searching the Internet.
	
	
	His Honour concluded on this issue that, notwithstanding the concerns raised by Basten JA in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim, which he had taken into account, he did not understand that it was suggested in that case that the decisions in Debs and Perish; Lawton were wrong.
	


The futility issue and jury directions


	
	His Honour then considered the authorities dealing with the ability of jurors to put to one side prejudicial publicity, and the assumption that jurors will obey directions and decide the case on the evidence adduced in the matter: see Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at [21]. By reference to the observations made in Perish and Debs, his Honour observed, at [43] of the take down judgment, that whilst the assumption was undoubtedly correct in respect of “the overwhelming majority of jurors”, there were examples where jurors had not obeyed directions. Accordingly, his Honour reached the view it would be not be futile to order that the “more troubling articles in the three categories identified … be taken down”.
	


Practical considerations


	
	Finally, his Honour accepted the possibility that the removal of the articles might mean that, for business and economic reasons, they would not be republished at the conclusion of the trials. Nonetheless, his Honour considered that these items had been online for a considerable period of time and, in circumstances where the media would be able to fully report on the evidence in, and outcome of the trial in due course, he did not consider the practical difficulties to which the media parties had referred “to be a significant interference with open justice of the public’s ‘right to know’”: take down judgment at [57].
	


Consideration


	
	Notwithstanding the very careful consideration his Honour gave to the making of the orders, and the views expressed by experienced trial judges in Perish and Deb, we have come to the conclusion that the take down orders would not result in the articles being sufficiently removed from the internet for the orders to be effective. In other words, we consider that it would be futile to make the orders.
	
	
	We have reached this conclusion notwithstanding that there was evidence that the removal of one item had had some effect in reducing the information available to a searcher on the internet. We are reinforced in this conclusion by two factors. First, much of the material is old. Secondly, we consider that a trial judge will be able to give adequate directions to a jury that they must determine the matter on the evidence before the Court. In this regard, we give full effect to the received wisdom of the courts, having conducted jury trials over the years, that juries act responsibly and in accordance with their oath, including in complying with the directions of the trial judge.
	
	
	Accordingly, we would allow the appeal in relation to the take down orders.
	


Non-publication of this judgment


	
	For the same reasons as we have given in upholding the non-publication order of the trial judge, an order under the Suppression Act for non-publication of this judgment should be made.
	


Orders


	
	In each matter:
	



	
	Order, pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), that no publication be made of the evidence and submissions in the Court of Appeal on Tuesday 3 May 2016 or this judgment until the conclusion of the trial of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi in relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun, or until further order;
	
	
	Order (1) above is to apply throughout the Commonwealth and is made on the basis of necessity to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice;
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed insofar as it relates to the non-publication orders made by Hamill J on 24 March 2016;
	
	
	Appeal allowed insofar as it relates to the take-down orders made by Hamill J on 24 March 2016;
	
	
	Set aside Orders (1)-(13) made by Hamill J in relation to Order (5) above.

2701549,Tobia v R [2016] NSWCCA 99,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with the judgment of Wilson J which encapsulates my reasons for joining in the making of the orders of the Court on the hearing of the application for leave to appeal on 21 April 2016.
	
	
	GARLING J: The reasons set out in the judgment of Wilson J, to which I have nothing to add, express my reasons for joining in the orders which the Court made on 21 April 2016.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 21 April 2016 this Court heard an application from Evin Tobia, the applicant, for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on 2 April 2015 in the District Court of New South Wales for an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation was that the applicant was in company with another offender, Yahyah Aili (“the co-offender”).
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing the Court made the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal allowed; and
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	These are my reasons for joining those orders.
	


The Proceedings Before the District Court


	
	The applicant came before the District Court on committal for sentence, having entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court on 26 November 2014. On 2 April 2015 he was sentenced by her Honour Judge Culver to a term of imprisonment for 3 years to date from 3 March 2015 and expiring on 2 March 2018, with a non-parole period of 15 months. The applicant was therefore first eligible for release from custody on 2 June 2016.
	
	
	An offence of aggravated break, enter and steal carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment as specified by Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The co-offender was referred to the Drug Court having been accepted into the Drug Court program. He faced initial sentence for this offence, and an additional related offence of steal from the person, contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act. The latter offence was taken into account on a Form 1 document pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The co-offender also faced sentence for a separate offence, being a further count of steal from the person.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months was fixed. The indicative sentence for the subject offence was imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months. The sentence was suspended upon the co-offender entering the Drug Court program. A non-parole period was not set, pending participation in the Program.
	
	
	The applicant was also eligible for entry into the Drug Court program, but was unsuccessful in gaining a place.
	


The Facts of the Offence


	
	The facts of the offence can be briefly stated. The larceny took place at a residential address in Liverpool on 14 May 2014. At about 4pm that day, the co-offender stole a handbag and its contents from a 55 year old woman (this offence was reflected by the s 94 offence that was taken into account when the co-offender was dealt with for the s 112(2) offence). The contents of the stolen handbag contained a number of personal items, including the victim’s house keys.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that the applicant played a role in that initial theft.
	
	
	At around 9pm that same day, the applicant and his co-offender used the stolen house keys to enter the victim’s premises when she was away from home. Whilst the key gave access to the front security screen door and the front entrance door of the premises (both of them locked), it was necessary for the offenders to break a security chain across the front door to gain entry.
	
	
	Over about an hour, the applicant and his co-offender ransacked the victim’s house and stole a number of items including specially issued Australian gold and silver coins, collected stamps, a digital camera, cash and various documents and cards.
	
	
	The statement of agreed facts indicates that the total value of the stolen property was $12,355.13. None of the property was ever recovered.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested on 20 May 2014; the co-offender was also arrested at around that time, the fingerprints of each having been found in the property. During an interview with police the applicant conceded that he and his co-offender had broken into the house and taken property from it, with the property later either pawned, thrown away, or burnt.
	


Additional Information in the Crown Case


	
	The applicant’s criminal history contained relatively few entries although, importantly, he had been previously convicted of a dishonesty offence, and was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the present offence.
	
	
	The applicant had two driving matters in his history (an offence of drive menacingly, and one of drive whilst disqualified) from October 2010 and May 2011, dealt with respectively by way of fine and bond. In December 2013 the applicant was convicted of an offence of steal from the person. He was fined, and made subject to a 2 year good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Additional charges of furnish false information and receiving stolen goods were dealt with by fine.
	
	
	Three days after the commission of the current offence the applicant committed the offence of steal from the person. He was sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment, commencing on 31 July 2014 and expiring on 30 July 2015. A non-parole period of six months was fixed, which expired on 29 January 2015.
	
	
	The applicant had been called up for the breach of the good behaviour bond that the current offence constituted, and sentenced to a term of 12 months imprisonment, backdated to commence on 31 October 2014. A non-parole period of 6 months was fixed, which expired on 30 April 2015.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report set out the applicant’s personal and family circumstances. He is the youngest of a number of children to his Christian Assyrian parents. Having been born in Iraq, the family were marginalised, and the applicant witnessed the killing of family members there. Two of his brothers died in the conflict in Iraq. The applicant’s family fled their homeland when the applicant was about twelve years old, living in Syria for two years, before settling in Australia.
	
	
	The applicant found school in this country difficult, and reported having been bullied. He left school at the beginning of Year 11. His only employment was very short term work as a cleaner and labourer.
	
	
	The applicant’s family are close and supportive, and the death of the applicant’s father in January 2014 affected the applicant considerably. The family reported that he became depressed.
	
	
	Members of the applicant’s family told the author of the pre-sentence report that the applicant fell in with anti-social friends when he arrived in Australia. He began to use cannabis at about sixteen years of age, and other drugs – methylamphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy – from the age of seventeen. The applicant said that this drug use and his unstable emotional state following his father’s death had led to his involvement in the subject offence.
	
	
	The applicant, who was in Australia subject to a visa, has had his visa cancelled. Whether his visa will be reinstated was undetermined at the time of sentencing.
	


The Applicant’s Case Before the Sentencing Court


	
	The applicant tendered a report from a forensic psychologist, Patrick Sheehan. The applicant gave Mr Sheehan a history broadly consistent with that contained in the pre-sentence report, although he did not give him a truthful account of his criminal history.
	
	
	He reported finding the transition to life in Australia difficult and felt bullied and alienated at school because of his poor English language skills. He fell in with a group of socially wayward teenagers and began truanting from school. The group introduced him to drug use and crime, much to the distress of his family. The applicant’s drug use continued because he felt anaesthetised from his memories and dreams of war and death when intoxicated. His health suffered; the applicant reported considerable improvement in his health and weight following his incarceration.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan noted that the symptoms reported by the applicant were consistent with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, although he could not suggest a firm diagnosis in the absence of any supporting evidence for the existence of the disorder. The applicant’s reported drug use met the criteria for a substance abuse disorder. Mr Sheehan opined that the applicant’s struggle to deal with the trauma of exposure to war set the context for his drug use, and the commission of the current offence.
	
	
	The applicant expressed remorse for what he had done to Mr Sheehan, stating that he had brought shame on his family.
	
	
	The applicant further expressed his remorse in a letter written by him to the sentencing judge, and another he had written to the court, as a means of conveying an apology to the victim of his crime, and to the community more broadly.
	
	
	In oral evidence before the sentencing judge on 2 April 2015, the applicant gave further detail of some of those matters referred to by Mr Sheehan, and in the letters to the court. He deposed that, upon release from prison, he intended to resume his studies to obtain his Higher School Certificate, and to work for his brother in his brother’s transport business.
	
	
	The applicant’s sister gave short evidence confirming his prospective employment.
	


The Position of the Co-Offender


	
	Tendered before the sentencing judge was a copy of the co-offender’s criminal history. Mr Aili had convictions for offences of cruelty to an animal, assaulting a police officer, and failing to appear. The latter was dealt with without penalty, whilst bonds were imposed for the former. The co-offender was not subject to any bond at the time of the commission of the offence.
	


The Remarks on Sentence


	
	In her Remarks, the sentencing judge set out the circumstances of the offence, noting that a level of pre-meditation, co-ordination, and organisation was involved in the crime. She referred to the distress occasioned to the victim of the crime, whose sense of security and sanctuary in her home was destroyed, particularly so where there had been damage occasioned to the property. Her Honour concluded that the seriousness of the offence was between the low and mid-range.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal history was set out, with her Honour noting that he was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offending conduct, that being an aggravating feature.
	
	
	The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant had committed the crime when affected by drugs, and referred to the applicant’s traumatic experiences in Iraq, and his resort to drug use. Her Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful, and that he was committed to his rehabilitation.
	
	
	She allowed a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed in recognition of the utilitarian benefit of the early entry of a plea of guilty.
	
	
	Referring to the co-offender, the sentencing judge said:
	


“His co-offender, it should be noted, has not yet been sentenced for his matters. His co-offender was successful in accessing the Drug Court Program. The offender tried twice to access that program but, due to no personal issue but rather his circumstance of serving a sentence and being rejected on the first occasion, he was rejected on both occasions.” (ROS 10)

The Proposed Appeal


	
	The applicant sought to advance two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	That he has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the marked disparity between his sentence and the sentence imposed on his co-offender, Yahyah Aili; and
	
	
	The overall sentence is manifestly excessive.
	


Ground 1: Sentence Disparity


	
	The applicant asserts that he has a justifiable sense of grievance given the marked disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and that initially fixed upon the co-offender in the Drug Court sentence proceedings. He complains that the unfairness is compounded by the fact that the indicated sentence for the co-offender, in addition to being shorter than that imposed upon him, was suspended due to participation in the Drug Court program.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the respective cases of the applicant and the co-offender were different, with the differences explaining and justifying the disparity in sentence. Additionally, the Crown contends that the co-offender’s participation in the Drug Court’s rehabilitative program cannot give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance.
	
	
	When sentence was imposed upon the applicant the co-offender had not been dealt with. At the hearing of this application the parties provided the Court with the Remarks on Sentence from the Drug Court, together with other documentary material that had been before the Drug Court.
	
	
	The co-offender was before the Drug Court for initial sentence on 30 April 2015, for the current offence and others not shared with the applicant. An aggregate sentence was imposed, as noted at [9] above. Taking into account the related steal from person offence, the Drug Court fixed the indicative sentence for this offence as one of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment. The sentence was suspended as a consequence of the co-offender’s participation in the Drug Court program.
	
	
	In determining the indicative sentence the sentencing judge referred to the sentence imposed upon the applicant, and noted that the applicant had a “more serious” record than did the co-offender (ROS 4), and was a “more serious offender” (ROS 5).
	
	
	The co-offender also received the benefit of a 25% discount on sentence in recognition of his early plea of guilty (the starting point for the indicative sentence being thus 3 years imprisonment).
	
	
	The court’s conclusion in relation to the respective criminal histories of the two offenders was correct, and it represents a significant difference in the cases of each. In particular, the applicant was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the present offence, a matter of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as the sentencing judge noted. That distinction alone is sufficient to warrant the difference in sentence (of nine months) between the head sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon the co-offender, no non-parole period having been set in relation to him, in accordance with s 7A(4) of the Drug Court Act 1998 (NSW).
	
	
	As was observed in Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64 at [65]; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 608:
	


“To focus on the result of the sentencing task, to the exclusion of the reasons which support the result, is to depart from fundamental principles of equal justice. Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.” (per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, emphasis in original)


	
	In the applicant’s case, the reason that supports the result is his greater criminal history, and the fact that he, unlike the co-offender, was subject to a bond to be of good behaviour when he committed this offence.
	
	
	The remaining matters of which the applicant makes complaint, that the co-offender received a suspended sentence with access to rehabilitative programs, whilst he did not, is also explained by a relevantly different feature, that being the co-offender’s acceptance to the Drug Court.
	
	
	On two separate occasions, 20 November 2014 and 26 March 2015, the applicant was referred to the Drug Court Program pursuant to s 6 of the Drug Court Act. Where there are more eligible applicants for entry to the Program than there are places on it, entry is determined by ballot. The applicant was not selected in the ballot, and he was unsuccessful in gaining entry to the Program. The co-offender was selected and was dealt with in that jurisdiction.
	
	
	Sections 44–48, 50, 51 and 51A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act do not apply to a person convicted and sentenced under s 7A of the Drug Court Act and, to that extent, individuals sentenced in the Drug Court are dealt with in a different way to persons sentenced in other courts.
	
	
	The sentencing procedure followed in the Drug Court is quite different to that followed in more conventional courts. Once satisfied of an offender’s eligibility (s 7A(2)(a)), and of a number of other matters set out in s7A(2)(b) – (g), the court proceeds to conviction and sentence. However, the execution of the sentence must be suspended and conditions imposed upon the offender relating to the rehabilitative program the offender is to enter: s 7A(5)(a) - (b).
	
	
	Any sentence imposed pursuant to s 7A is an “initial sentence”. No non-parole period is specified. The “final sentence” is determined pursuant to s 12 of the Act. The initial sentence may be set aside and another sentence imposed, as provided for by Part 2 of the Drug Court Act or the initial sentence may be confirmed: s 12(3)(a) - (b). The final sentence cannot exceed the initial sentence: s 12(4).
	
	
	The co-offender had not, at the time of the hearing before this Court, been before the Drug Court for final sentence.
	
	
	It must be accepted that sentences imposed by the Drug Court, whether they be initial or final sentences, may incorporate what may be perceived to be a significant measure of leniency. That is a consequence of the importance of achieving an offender’s rehabilitation, consistent with the objectives of the statutory scheme under which the Drug Court operates. Section 3(1) of the Act provides for three objects:
	


“3 Objects 

(1) The objects of this Act are:

(a)  to reduce the drug dependency of eligible persons and eligible convicted offenders, and

(b)  to promote the re-integration of such drug dependent persons into the community, and

(c)  to reduce the need for such drug dependent persons to resort to criminal activity to support their drug dependencies.”


	
	Due to the specific statutory objectives under which initial and final sentences are determined by the Drug Court, objectives that have no application outside that court, it is generally unproductive to attempt to make a direct comparison between a sentence imposed in that jurisdiction and a sentence imposed in another court. Such an exercise is not dissimilar to making a comparison between a sentence imposed for a particular offence in the Children’s Court and a sentence imposed for the same offence in the Local Court. The parity principle in those circumstances could have little or no application. It must similarly have little or no application in circumstances where the complaint of disparity, as here, focuses on the suspension of sentence pursuant to s 7A(5)(b) of the Drug Court Act, and the access given to a co-offender to a rehabilitation program.
	
	
	For persons who satisfy the criteria for eligibility to the Drug Court, as the applicant and his co-offender did, admission to the Drug Court Program is to some extent a matter of chance. For example, r 4 of the Drug Court Regulation 2015 (NSW) provides that only persons whose usual place of residence falls within specified local government areas can be eligible for acceptance by the court. It is simply not open to offenders who happen to live outside the nominated areas to seek access to the Drug Court. Similarly, even if an offender meets all of the requirements for acceptance to the Drug Court program, there may be insufficient places available on any given week, and an individual may not be selected in the ballot process which is then employed, provided for by Policy 12 of the Drug Court Policies, as in force from time to time.
	
	
	As Basten JA observed in Scicluna v R [2008] NSWCCA 24; (2008) 181 A Crim R 133, at [10] (Barr J agreeing):
	


“It follows that it is not the diversion into a rehabilitation program which is to be compared, for the purposes of parity in sentencing, with the imprisonment imposed on a co-offender. The legitimate comparison is between the initial sentence imposed in accordance with the Sentencing Procedure Act and the sentence imposed on the co-offender. The fact that one co-offender is eligible for the program because of drug dependency, whilst another is not, may itself have consequences for the relevant comparison; nevertheless, it is the equivalent sentences under the Sentencing Procedure Act which must be compared.”


	
	One can readily understand that the applicant could feel aggrieved that his co-offender, through the happenstance of being both eligible for the Drug Court program, and selected for one of the limited available places by ballot, received an apparently better outcome than him. However, the sense of grievance necessary to attract the intervention of this Court is measured by objective criteria, without reference to the feelings of the person aggrieved: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49 at [31]; (2011) 244 CLR 462.
	
	
	The apparently better outcome for the co-offender through his participation in the Drug Court program must be set aside, and the comparison for the purposes of determining a parity ground is to be made between the initial indicated sentence of 2 years and 3 months imprisonment fixed for the co-offender (final sentence not having been determined), and that of 3 years imprisonment for the applicant. The divergence in those sentences is readily explained by the differing criminal histories of each.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.
	


Ground 2: Manifest Excess


	
	It is noted at the outset that the second of the two grounds advanced by the applicant is inconsistent with the first ground, grounds of this nature having been previously held to be contradictory: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; McMullen v R [2013] NSWCCA 261 at [49]; Loh v R [2013] NSWCCA 339 at [41]. A parity ground accepts that the sentence is otherwise appropriate; a manifest excess ground argues that the sentence is unfair and unjust. The two grounds do not comfortably sit together.
	
	
	As is oft stated, to establish a complaint of manifest excess the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was “unreasonable or plainly unjust”: R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54 at [3]; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325. This has to be established in a context where there is no single “correct” sentence, and judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach.
	
	
	The question for this Court is whether the length of the sentence is demonstrated to be outside the range of sound sentencing discretion. In determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive it is necessary to examine the result through the prism of the maximum prescribed penalty, the place which the criminal conduct occupies on the scale of seriousness of offences of the kind in question, and the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	The maximum penalty specified for an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years attaches to the offence. Those were the statutory guidelines to which the sentencing judge had to have regard.
	
	
	Her Honour assessed the matter as falling between the low range and the mid-range of gravity for offences of this nature, an assessment with which the applicant takes no issue.
	
	
	The applicant’s personal circumstances were given careful attention by the sentencing judge, with her Honour finding (favourably to the applicant) that he was remorseful, and determined to undertake drug rehabilitation. She also concluded that he needed assistance to come to terms with his experiences in Iraq. Reflecting those conclusions, the sentencing judge found that special circumstances existed pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. She varied the non-parole period from the statutory norm of 75% to a very considerable extent, with the non-parole period of 15 months representing less than 42% of the total term imposed. That is a considerable measure of leniency.
	
	
	Further leniency was inherent in the commencement date specified for the sentence, in that there was a degree of concurrency allowed to the applicant with unrelated sentences imposed in another court, in circumstances where the principle of totality did not require concurrency, and the criminality of the offences was wholly separate.
	
	
	The applicant’s crime involved forcible entry into another person’s home, causing damage to the premises in the process. The offenders stole a considerable quantity of valuable items, with some of the property treated with such disregard as to be later thrown away or burnt. None of the stolen property was recovered. When the offender’s criminal history for dishonesty and the conditional liberty to which he was subject at the time is also taken into account, I do not conclude other than that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge reflects the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.
	
	
	I am unable to conclude that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. Indeed, particularly having regard to the structure and commencement date of the sentence imposed by her Honour, it may be regarded as mercifully lenient.
	
	
	This ground is not made out.

The application before the court


	
	The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle collision between her scooter and the defendant’s vehicle on 25 August 2011, but did not commence proceedings for personal injury within the time limits of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Act”). By summons filed on 31 August 2015, the plaintiff seeks leave to commence court proceedings out of time pursuant to s 109 of the Act, and for costs to be costs in the cause.
	
	
	The plaintiff suffered a fractured right ankle and left scapula, according to the Expert Certificate dated 21 September 2011 (as annexed to the Affidavit of the plaintiff, Exhibit A). On 28 August 2011 she underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the right ankle. Her left scapula fracture was treated conservatively with physiotherapy. She also had fracture clinic follow-up for both injuries. No brain injury was noted in the hospital records, although a medical certificate for time off work refers to some cerebral contusion (Exhibit A).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s evidence consists of the affidavit sworn on 5 November 2015 which is Exhibit A. Information about the legal advice given to the plaintiff by her current solicitor is set out in the affidavit of Linda Kristine Charleston sworn on 31 August 2015, which is Exhibit B. There are no medico-legal or treating reports concerning the plaintiff’s ongoing physical disabilities and the psychiatric reports refer to the accident only in the context of reporting the plaintiff’s admission that it occurred because she had been drinking and was trying to commit suicide.
	
	
	The evidence of the defendant, who opposes the application, is set out in the affidavit of Nathan Kennedy and the three volumes of exhibits appended thereto (Exhibit 1).
	
	
	A number of additional reports and records were tendered by both parties during the hearing.
	
	
	At the commencement of the hearing, the defendant brought an application for summary dismissal on the basis of estoppel per rem judicatam. My reasons for refusing to hear that application on a summary dismissal basis, are set out at the end of this judgment.
	


Background


	
	The plaintiff was injured at approximately 10.30 pm on 25 August 2011, while riding on her scooter on her way home. She sets out, in paragraphs 3 and 4 of her affidavit, that the last event she remembers is riding in an easterly direction along New South Head Road. Her next recollection is of waking up in “what appeared to be a hospital” (paragraph 4). She remembers little else of her stay there, and states that she was “informed by someone that I was suffering from post-traumatic amnesia” and “bleeding on the brain” (paragraph 5). After surgery on 28 August 2011, the plaintiff was discharged on 2 September 2011.
	
	
	This is one of several different accounts of the plaintiff’s accident. The others are:
	



	
	In an Accident Notification Form the plaintiff completed while in hospital in “about late August 2011” (affidavit of the plaintiff, paragraph 6), she drew a plan and gave a description of being hit while turning right into New South Head Road. That diagram and account are set out in Annexure A to the plaintiff’s affidavit.
	
	
	On 14 September 2011, the plaintiff made a statement to Sergeant Lehman of Rose Bay Police, in which she said that she was travelling across the intersection of New South Head Road on a green light, but otherwise did not actually recall the accident; she provided this information on the basis that this was what she normally did on her way home (Annexure C to the plaintiff’s affidavit). She was told that a blood sample returned a positive reading of 0.093 (mid-range).
	
	
	The plaintiff, who had a long pre-accident history of psychiatrict treatment including hospital admissions, made statements to nine psychologists and psychiatrists treating her for pre-existing problems, from 2011 onwards, to the effect that she had been drinking on the night of the accident, and was trying to commit suicide (Exhibits 1 and 13). There are no reports from psychologists or psychiatrists giving any other version of the events of the night in question.
	
	
	The plaintiff made statements in relation to court proceedings in January 2012, when the plaintiff was sentenced for driving unlicensed, unregistered and with a blood alcohol reading of 0.093 (mid-range) in her system (Exhibit A and Exhibit 1). Importantly, those charges did not reflect any responsibility for the accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff signed a consent judgment “without admission of liability” to settle proceedings (for the full amount) commenced against her by the defendant for motor vehicle property damage in the Local Court, Downing Centre. Those statements included the filing of a defence and the making of written submissions on liability.
	
	
	The plaintiff provided a hand drawn map in a second Motor Accident Personal Injury Claim Form attached to the affidavit of Ms Charleston. The drawing is reasonably similar to the first but the section “description of the accident” (question 16) is left blank (Exhibit B, annexure E).
	
	
	The plaintiff gave evidence in these proceedings as to how the accident occurred. In particular, she denied that she had been attempting to commit suicide (T 144), which is inconsistent with being unable to remember the accident (see 8(a) and 8(b) above).
	



	
	For the purpose of this application, I must assume that the plaintiff is successful on liability. The differing versions of the accident are, however, relevant to the threshold issue (s 109(3) (b) of the Act) in relation to contributory negligence issues: Reeves v Reeves (2002) 36 MVR 488 (“Reeves”) at [8]-[14].
	


The issues for determination


	
	The issues for determination are as follows:
	



	
	Full and satisfactory explanation:  The plaintiff must give a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings (s 109(3)(a) of the Act). The three year period expired on 25 August 2014.
	
	
	Damages over the threshold: The plaintiff must also establish that the heads of damage likely to be awarded are not less than 25% of the maximum amount in respect of non-economic loss (s 109(3)(b) of the Act). This includes any adjustment for contributory negligence: Reeves at [8]-[14].
	
	
	Estoppel per rem judicatam: A separate issue is whether the consent orders in the Local Court in favour of Mr Ching (the defendant to these proceedings) amount to issue estoppel: Tiufino v Warland (2000) 50 NSWLR 104; Charafeddine v Morgan (2014) 66 MVR 232. The plaintiff relies upon the fact that the consent orders were expressed to be “without admission of liability” and the defendant relies upon the acknowledged fact (plaintiff’s outline of submissions, paragraph 16) that the proceedings were settled for the full amount of the claim without any compromise of the claim, which it is submitted renders the terms “without admission of liability” otiose for the purposes of issue estoppel (Isaacs v Ocean Accident & Guarantee Corp Ltd (1958) SR (NSW) 69 at 76 and Ekes v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2014) 313 ALR 665 at [112]-[114]).
	


The relevant legislation and time periods


	
	Section 109 of the Act provides:
	


“109 Time limitations on commencement of court proceedings

(1) A claimant is not entitled to commence proceedings in respect of a claim more than 3 years after:

(a) the date of the motor accident to which the claim relates, or

(b) if the claim is made in respect of the death of a person-the date of death, except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be taken.

(2) Time does not run for the purposes of this section from the time that a claim has been referred to the Authority for assessment and until 2 months after a certificate as to the assessment or exemption from assessment is issued.

(3) The leave of the court must not be granted unless:

(a) the claimant provides a full and satisfactory explanation to the court for the delay, and

(b) the total damages of all kinds likely to be awarded to the claimant if the claim succeeds are not less than 25% of the maximum amount that may be awarded for non-economic loss under section 134 as at the date of the relevant motor accident.

(4) Subsection (3) (b) does not apply to a claimant who is legally incapacitated because of the claimant’s age or mental capacity.

(5) The Limitation Act 1969 does not apply to or in respect of proceedings in respect of a claim.”


	
	As noted above, the three-year period from the date of the accident (25 August 2011) expired on 25 August 2014. On 3 November 2014 a CARS 1A Application for Exemption was filed, which exemption was granted on 28 November 2014; time then resumed running from 28 August 2015.
	
	
	Most of the hearing time was spent in determination of the question of whether the plaintiff could exceed the 25% threshold set out in s 109(3)(b) of the Act. The relevant maximum amount set by the Motor Accidents Compensation (Determination of Loss) Amendment Order 2010 is $432,000. That means that the plaintiff must, in addition to providing a full and satisfactory explanation, satisfy the court that the damages awarded for her injuries and disabilities (including past and future economic loss and out of pockets, and subject to any adjustment for contributory negligence) are likely to be not less than $108,000.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence


	
	The plaintiff’s explanation for her delay in commencing proceedings may be generally stated as being due to memory difficulties relating to head injuries sustained in the accident and to subsequent physical disabilities, as well as the impact of these disabilities upon her long pre-accident history of psychiatric problems. She was re-admitted to hospital in relation to those problems, as well as for the removal of the screw in her right ankle, on 6 December 2011, and on a series of occasions in 2012.
	
	
	Although the plaintiff now acknowledges that she completed an Accident Notification Form in August 2011 and received a letter from CIC Allianz on or about 15 September 2011 denying provisional liability for the CTP claim, she has no recollection of these events. When she consulted her current solicitors in July 2014, her evidence is that she had forgotten about having done so, which is why she filled in a fresh claim form.
	
	
	In January 2012, the plaintiff attended court in relation to charges arising from driving while unlicensed and unregistered and driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol. She was fined and disqualified from driving for 12 months. As already noted, she was not charged with any offences in relation to the incident itself, and she did not consult lawyers about these matters.
	
	
	Mr Ching, the defendant in these proceedings, brought proceedings for motor vehicle property damage in 2012, which are outlined in more detail below. The plaintiff says she did not seek legal advice about this claim either, although she had some help from the duty solicitor on the day of the hearing.
	
	
	The plaintiff obtained full time work in about February 2012, although she told the court she was in considerable pain and taking medication over this period. She continued to see psychiatrists and psychologists over this whole period and discussed the accident with them, but challenges their accounts of her having caused the accident because she was trying to commit suicide.
	
	
	The plaintiff was, however, sufficiently aware of her personal injury entitlements, in or about May 2012, to make telephone calls to “several firms of lawyers” (affidavit of 5 November 2015, paragraph 29) about her entitlement to commence proceedings for personal injury. She was told each time that a minimum security deposit of $10,000 would be necessary for any of these legal firms to act for her. She does not recall any of those firms giving her advice about submitting a claim form within six months.
	
	
	Ms Charleston, in her affidavit of 31 August 2015, deposes to having been given two unopened letters sent to the plaintiff by Slater & Gordon, solicitors when the plaintiff first consulted her (Exhibit B). Slater & Gordon had sent the plaintiff a series of letters, two of which she failed to open, and which were opened by Ms Charleston.
	
	
	The first of these confirmed an appointment date of 30 October 2012 (Annexure A to Ms Charleston’s affidavit) and requested her to bring all relevant documents. The second of these unopened letters clearly follows a missing letter dated 30 October 2012 concerning the plaintiff’s missed appointment for that day, the contents of which are set out in more detail below. The contents of this unopened letter noted that the plaintiff had not contacted the writer for a fresh appointment and went on to say:
	


“For the sake of completeness I now repeat the time limits prescribed by the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.

These time limits are:

If the Police did not attend, the motor accident must be reported to the Police within 28 days of the Accident.

An Accident Notification Form must be lodged with the Compulsory Third Party Insurer of the vehicle that caused the accident within 28 days of the accident.

A Personal Injury Claim Form must be lodged with the Third Party Insurer of the vehicle that caused the accident within 6 months of the accident.

Court proceedings (if relevant) must be commenced within 3 years of the accident.

If you fail to comply with these time limits, you may be prevented from making or continuing with a claim for compensation unless you can provide a full and satisfactory explanation for the delay. If you do not commence court proceedings within 3 years there is an additional requirement to show that your compensation exceeds a monetary threshold.”


	
	At the time the plaintiff consulted Slater & Gordon, the only outstanding steps were, in fact, the last two, as the plaintiff had already advised Slater & Gordon she had filled out a claim form (see the text of the Slater & Gordon internal email below). The plaintiff claims she was never on notice as to the time limits because she never opened these letters, but the evidence is against this.
	
	
	First, although she never made a fresh appointment with Slater & Gordon, she had already filled out a notification form while still in hospital in August 2011, and went on to submit a motor accident personal injury claim form to CIC Allianz on 14 November 2012, some nine months after the applicable time limit (although the plaintiff states, at paragraph 39 of her affidavit, that she “cannot remember” doing so) and received the denial of liability sent on 24 November 2012.
	
	
	Second, it is clear from the wording of this letter that Slater & Gordon were not telling her this information for the first time, but repeating it, and doing so in circumstances where the plaintiff was warned, by the opening words of the letter, that its author would not take any action to protect her interests. The plaintiff’s claim that she did not open this letter must be seen in the light of her overall knowledge as revealed from these other sources of information available to her.
	
	
	Third, the plaintiff had received a letter from CIC Allianz in or about 15 September 2011 denying provisional liability due to “conflicting versions” of the accident and advising her to submit a Personal Injury Claim Form (paragraph 12 of the plaintiff’s affidavit), which the insurance company sent to her. The contents of that letter and its warnings (which she did open, and must be taken to have read) were clear.
	
	
	The documents produced by Slater & Gordon in answer to a subpoena for their file are set out at Tab 7 of Exhibit 1. The internal emails between staff confirm that the plaintiff was booked in for a two-hour conference on 30 October 2012 but cancelled due to bronchitis; an appointment was rescheduled for 1 November 2012 at 2 pm. Both meetings were given a two-hour estimate, and were clearly intended to cover many matters. The plaintiff acknowledged this new appointment date and “wanted you to know that she has gone through her file and she did lodge a claim with the CTP insurer” (Exhibit 1 p. 330). She was sent another letter about this conference and told to bring copies of all claim forms. The second letter is on page 333 of Exhibit 1. She did not attend this second appointment, without giving any explanation, and it was in this context that the second unopened letter, the contents of which are set out above, was sent.
	
	
	Another inconsistency between the plaintiff’s evidence and these documents is that they do not refer to any request to the plaintiff for money to be paid for this meeting to take place. There are obligations upon solicitors under the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) to provide fee agreements and information about the terms of retainer. The documents show that the plaintiff was being offered a two-hour meeting to discuss her claim. While I am prepared to accept that general statements were made about the payment of disbursements, there was nothing in the correspondence or emails to suggest that this was a prerequisite for the meeting,
	
	
	The plaintiff was also on notice of there being a claim by the defendant for motor vehicle property damage at this time, as she was served with his statement of claim in June 2012. The plaintiff attended the Local Court, obtained an adjournment without legal representation and, on or about 10 August 2012, filed a defence denying liability. These proceedings were on foot at a time when she was consulting Slater & Gordon.
	
	
	In March 2013, the defendant’s property damage proceedings were listed for hearing. The plaintiff appeared for herself, although she received some assistance from the court-appointed solicitor at the Local Court in relation to the consent orders. Those events are set out in more detail below in the section of this judgment in relation to issue estoppel. She acknowledged in cross-examination that she had some assistance from a family member in relation to the drafting of documents for those proceedings.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s affidavit is silent as to what she was doing, in relation to her activities generally, between 5 April 2013, the date she signed the Consent Orders in relation to Mr Ching’s property damage claim, and June 2014. That is a significant gap.
	
	
	In June 2014, while in hospital for a tonsillectomy, the plaintiff was told by a friend to consult a lawyer about her injuries, as there was a three-year time limit for the bringing of court proceedings in relation to her claim. The plaintiff also, at this time, spoke to her father, a former barrister, who “encouraged me to consider the possibility of a personal injury claim” (affidavit of 5 November 2015, paragraph 43). On 1 July 2014, the plaintiff contacted Ms Charleston, her solicitor in this application. She also applied to the NSW Police under the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) for police records on or about 4 July 2014. She provided a number of documents to Ms Charleston during July 2014 and made enquiries about any photographs of the scene of the accident.
	
	
	It is unclear what steps the plaintiff took between October 2014 and 11 February 2015, but I note that on 3 November 2014 a CARS 1A application for exemption was filed which stayed the running of time; a certificate was granted on 28 November 2014. This meant that the time resumed running from 28 January 2015. On 11 February 2015, the plaintiff provided the statutory declaration in relation to the delay in lodging the claim form as required under s 73 of the Act. The Summons was not filed until 31 August 2015, and the affidavit of Ms Charleston sworn 31 August 2015 sets out the background to this further period of delay.
	
	
	As the plaintiff’s must satisfy the threshold test under s 109(3)(b) as well as demonstrate a full and satisfactory explanation, and her explanation for delay is the poor state of her mental and physical health, I shall deal with the threshold issue first.
	


Section 109(3)(b): the threshold issue


	
	The manner in which the court undertakes the determination of whether the plaintiff is “likely” to reach the threshold is set out in Dijakovic v Perez (2015) 71 MVR 334 (“Dijakovic v Perez”) at [109] as follows:
	


“It is well established that the term “likely” in s 109(3)(b) means a “real chance” or a “real prospect”: Sinclair v Darwich (2010) 77 NSWLR 166 ; 56 MVR 116 ; [2010] NSWCA 195 at [36]; Eadesat [10]. As Basten JA explained in Eades, the relevant shade of meaning of “likely” in the present context is conveyed by “the notion of a substantial, as distinct from a remote chance”: Chan v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 389 ; 87 ALR 412 at 418 per Mason CJ.


	
	The threshold issue should be approached by taking the plaintiff’s medical evidence at its highest: Dijakovic v Perez at [120]. That is something of a problem here, as the plaintiff does not produce any medico-legal reports or treating reports relating the circumstances of her accident to her injuries and current disabilities.
	


Non-economic loss


	
	The plaintiff’s submission is that prior to her accident her “general state of health” was “very good” (affidavit, paragraph 67). Following the accident, she claims she has been left with significant residual disability and loss of earning capacity.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s disabilities are set out at paragraphs 73, 74 and 80 as follows:
	


“73. The accident has left me with ongoing physical and psychological disabilities. I have cognitive problems from the head injury, including difficulties with memory and concentration. I also feel that my pre-existing eating disorder has been aggravated by the accident. The orthopaedic surgeon inserted metallic structures into the ankle. I have difficulty with prolonged weight-bearing, both in standing and walking. I am no longer able to run or wear high heels for more than about ten steps. This is due to pain and stiffness in my right foot and ankle. The inability to wear high heels hampers me in my corporate presentation as it restricts the range of suitable corporate clothing I can wear. Pain in the foot and ankle also keeps me awake at nights, especially after long days at work.

74. I have disfigurement of the right ankle and foot caused by unsightly scarring and discolouration. This is embarrassing to me and deters me from wearing revealing footwear or going barefoot in front of people. This is a problem during the summer months when enclosed footwear is uncomfortable and unfashionable. I cannot wear certain types of footwear because of this. Certain types of footwear rub against the scarring and cause discomfort and abrasions.

…

80. I have been feeling more physical pain in my back, legs and ankle since I started work at Benchmark Media. As a result, this has aggravated my depression. I do not cope well with pressure anymore. I feel a sense of failure. In about early June 2015 I was placed on the maximum dose of anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication. I am heavily medicated and I often do not have clarity of thought or expression. The medication slows down my mental processes and I have to check and re-check my work. It also affects my memory and concentration. I made solid and honest attempts to sustain the employment, but on 29 September 2015 I eventually had to resign from my position at Benchmark Media due to extreme stress, depression and anxiety.”


	
	As the plaintiff had tendered no medical evidence in support of her claims of injury and ongoing disabilities, I made the following inquiry:
	


“HER HONOUR: Mr Thompson, you haven't tendered any medical reports in support of this application, have you?

THOMPSON: That's correct, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: You're not going to, are you?

THOMPSON: That's correct, your Honour.” (T 144)


	
	Over Mr Renshaw’s objections, I gave the plaintiff a short adjournment to enable Ms Charleston to answer Mr Renshaw’s calls for medical reports supporting the plaintiff’s claim in relation to injuries and disabilities. None were forthcoming, although a treating report from Professor Russell, with some comments about her state of mind generally in 2013, was provided. A report from Dr Symboluk on this issue was also produced, and was later tendered by the defendant (Exhibit 13).
	
	
	The disabilities the plaintiff sets out in her affidavit fall into two main categories, namely ongoing problems with the right ankle and foot as well as cognitive problems.
	


Disability and disfigurement of the right ankle and foot


	
	The plaintiff’s evidence concerning ankle and foot restrictions, pain, scarring and other disabilities was tested in cross-examination as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s claim that she was unable to run after the accident is inconsistent with her having entered a series of half-marathons and mini-marathons, in her own name (such as the Sydney Morning Herald Half Marathon in 2015, where she finished in just under two hours – Exhibits 3, 5 and 8) and under the name “Genevieve Rothschild” in the 2014 Sri Chinmoy Centennial Park Half-Marathon (running 10.35 kilometres in 54.33 minutes – Exhibits 9 and 11). There are photographs on social media (including posts on the Genevieve Rothschild social media accounts) clearly showing her running in the second event, and wearing the number allocated to her. She also posted reports for a run of 10.51 kilometres in Victoria (in 49.58 minutes) in November 2014, a run in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney of 21.08 kilometres in 2.11 hours in September 2014, a run of 26.15 kilometres in 2.38 hours in August 2014 and two other runs of 40.01 and 30.04 kilometres over the same track for the same month on her Instagram account, but said she did not participate in these runs, and merely posted the results of others (Exhibit 11). The plaintiff’s inconsistent answers, followed by a reluctant admission that she had run in some of these marathons, was a significant blow to her credit, as was her lack of frankness about the use of other names in social media.
	
	
	Although the plaintiff says she is unable to wear high heels, she has posted several photographs of herself wearing high heels on social media, such as the photograph on the third page of Exhibit 11.
	
	
	The plaintiff regularly posted photographs of her feet onto an Instagram account she operated under the name “Genevieve Rothschild” (Exhibit 3 sets out ten of these photographs and there are many more in the three volumes of exhibits attached to Exhibit 1). None of these photographs display any evidence of unsightly scarring or discolouration, let alone the embarrassment the plaintiff refers to in paragraph 74 of her affidavit.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s social media accounts show her leading a very physically active social life, travelling overseas several times a year and participating in horse breeding and riding (Exhibit 1 pp1049 – 1052, 1079, 1090 - 1). Photographs of the 6.15 am spin cycle class advertisement, and of herself in gym clothing and working out with weights (Exhibit 1 pp 1066, 1077), as well as frequent references to athletic training and outdoor activities such as boating and swimming undermine her claims of being reluctant to bare her feet publicly or engage in activities of a physically strenuous nature.
	



	
	The plaintiff initially denied that she had participated in any marathons and said that she had posted marathon entries by other persons with whom she shared social media. After the plaintiff was shown photographs of herself wearing the marathon number and running on the field or at the finish line in two events, she retracted some of these statements:
	


“A. No, I did not make these runs. These are screen-shotted images shared through social media and channels I have.

Q. So when Geraldine Rothschild utters words that seem to suggest that she made those runs who is making that representation, if not you?

A. Well, it's a representation that I've posted about but it's not me performing the run. There's these re-posting apps and lots of different accounts for mindfulness and travel and my dog's got an Instagram account.

Q. Look at page - the one with the 40 kilometres. ""Distance day done."" This is Genevieve Rothschild. ""Distance day done. Reached the peak. All downhill from here. She smashed the 30 - 21 - 30 and 36 personal best.""

A. Yes, she - one of my girlfriends was preparing for the Sydney Marathon and that was a screen shot off her phone of the course she did. I think it was about two years ago. She was training for it.

Q. Well, go to the next page where it's got ""Genevieve Rothschild under the hammer 30 in sub 2 hours 50 distance done. Now study. Then get ready for tonight.""

A. ..(not transcribable)..

Q. Are you seriously saying that you did not make that representation?

A. The one of the 40 kilometre one, no, I—” (T 26).


	
	The plaintiff also denied that she ran in the Herald marathon:
	


“Q. I want you to be very careful about this because there have been a series of answers that you've given where you have categorically denied that you have been running. Do you say that you have never run since this accident?

A. No, I wouldn't say I've never run.

Q. Have you ever run in a marathon or half-marathon?

A. No, I had teams of friends who were doing fundraising for it.

Q. You've never been a candidate?

A. No.

Q. Bit unfortunate that your e-ticket entry confirmation for 2014 Sydney Morning Herald Half-Marathon, name Genevieve Amor-Smith. Have a look at that.

…

Q. What was the number in the marathon that you had supposedly?

A. What was the what, sorry?

Q. You see, here's a photograph of you third down from the right with the - something attached to your jumper as a contender in a long distance run, isn't it? We can magnify it, don't worry about that.

A. Yeah, you're going to have to.

Q. What was the number in the marathon that you had supposedly?

A. What was the what, sorry?

Q. You see, here's a photograph of you third down from the right with the - something attached to your jumper as a contender in a long distance run, isn't it? We can magnify it, don't worry about that.

A. Yeah, you're going to have to.

…

Q. You obviously entered the 2014 Sydney Morning Herald part marathon, did you?

A. Yeah, from the e-ticket.

Q. But you say you didn't run it?

A. No: not possible. I thought I could. I thought if I push on and be able to run and look after my legs that it would work, but the ankle was just not holding up.

…

Q. That's you is it not?

A. Yeah, that's me in a photo in exercise gear.

Q. Being photographed coming across the line? Why else would you be photographed?

A. That's not coming across a line, because people are walking in all different directions.

Q. You are being photographed in finishing a race, aren't you?

A. No, that was not the finish.

Q. What is it then that is depicted?

A. That was not the finish of the race. (T 28 – 31)


	
	The plaintiff eventually conceded that she had run in this race, but claimed she had cheated in order to finish it in the under-2-hour time given for her run time. Mr Renshaw asked her:
	


“Q. You never said yesterday that you in fact cheated and didn't complete it, did you?

A. You cut me off a lot yesterday. You never let me get a word in.

Q. Why don't you answer the question? You never said that, did you?

A. No, I didn't say that.” (T 103)


	
	The plaintiff also sought to explain her appearance in another race as an example of identity theft:
	


“Q. Yes, well, no, you've proposed this to her Honour as a feasible alternative. What possible advantage could any sane person get out of doing this?

A. People might run under different names for all sorts of reasons.

Q. No, but a sane person. So you're suggesting that someone would just adopt your name and run a half-marathon, and in fact two of them, within a couple of months, at much the same time?

A. People can change - if they want to put whatever name they want to register in a charity event or a running event they can put whatever name up they want and if they want to be in a certain of class of runners then put a class of runner or a name of a runner who is in that class. It's the same as the water polo teams I used to be in.” (T 56)


	
	The plaintiff eventually conceded she had run when shown a photograph of herself competing, wearing athletic clothing and a large race entry number.
	
	
	I have set out this evidence in some detail because it confirms that the plaintiff has made a complete recovery from her fracture and is in the peak of physical health.
	


The plaintiff’s fracture to her scapula


	
	This injury was treated conservatively. I received no submissions as to any impact on the plaintiff’s health caused by it.
	


Cognitive difficulties and brain injury


	
	The plaintiff’s claim for injury to her ankle is based on there being concrete evidence of an ankle injury. There are no hospital records (T 78 – 79) or medical reports to support any claim that the plaintiff had bleeding on the brain, amnesia, or cognitive difficulties of any kind following the accident. A CT scan of the brain showed normal results (T 116).
	
	
	There is a statement in the Police Facts that she suffered fractures to her right foot, ankle and shoulder and “mild bleeding within the skull” (Full Facts, page 2, Exhibit A), but the medical certificate from the hospital refers only to the fractured right ankle and left scapula (Expert Certificate, Exhibit A, page 1). As previously noted, there is a reference to “intracerebral contusion” in the medical certificate of Dr Simon Tan of 6 September 2011, but there is no reference to any symptoms or treatment. Nor is there any reference in any of the psychiatric treatment records that the plaintiff suffered from, or was being treated for, any such injury or ongoing disability.
	
	
	Contrary to the plaintiff’s claim that she enjoyed good health generally before the accident, her medical history is replete with evidence of psychiatric referrals, which in turn indicate alcohol, bulimia and psychiatric problems requiring not only treatment but hospital admissions, particularly in the six months prior to the accident. Dr Symboluk (Exhibit 13) notes that the plaintiff attended psychiatry sessions drunk in December 2010 – January 2011 and attempted suicide on Christmas Eve and again on two occasions in early 2011, including admissions to hospital. Her scores for depression in May 2011 were in the “extremely severe” range and, in June 2011, she was hospitalised for three days. It was in this context, Dr Symboluk noted, when she resumed therapy in January 2012, that the plaintiff had attempted to take her life by driving her scooter into a car, this being a description of the accident the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	The defendant tendered eight other medical records (Exhibits 1 and 13) which consistently note the plaintiff as having described the accident as a suicide attempt.
	
	
	The plaintiff initially denied ever giving such an explanation (T 22) and then explained these entries inconsistently as being “untrue” (in the case of Dr Symboluk) and for the purpose of obtaining urgent admission to hospital which she would not otherwise have received, or that the doctors had told her to say this (T 40 – 50). I do not accept that evidence. The plaintiff’s statements were volunteered separately, not repeated from one doctor to another, in circumstances where the plaintiff needed no further embellishment of her problems to be admitted to hospital or to receive psychiatric treatment.
	
	
	The absence of any medical evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim mean that she could not establish any cognitive difficulties or head injury of any kind referable to the motor vehicle accident.
	
	
	As to psychiatric issues, the plaintiff had essentially the same pattern of psychiatric admission after the accident as before. Any change in this pattern is so slight that it cannot be detected.
	


Conclusions concerning non-economic loss


	
	The plaintiff suffered a fracture of the ankle which required surgery and the insertion of a pin. The scapula fracture was treated conservatively and beyond this I have no further information. No injury to the brain beyond some form of bruising (untreated) is evident. She was away from work for about 22 weeks, but much of this is due to her pre-existing psychiatric problems, which I am satisfied were not worsened by the accident, there being no evidence to the contrary (T 159).
	
	
	On the night of the accident she had been at the gym running 10-15 kilometres, according to her statement to police. The plaintiff made such a good recovery from her accident that she is able to compete in marathons. Her physical health is excellent and there are no photographs to show scarring or unsightliness.
	
	
	The plaintiff would, in my view of the evidence, be awarded damages in the very low range for an ankle injury from which she has made a complete recovery. It is hard to put a figure on this without the benefit of at least some medical evidence as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s injury and disabilities, or an agreement of the kind which occurred in Dijakovic v Perez, (where the parties agreed that non-economic loss was $97,000, and where there had were reports, albeit later set aside, by CARS). Mr Renshaw submits, and I agree, that in the absence of medical evidence in relation to any claim for ongoing disabilities, I should not make any allowance for non-economic loss.
	
	
	The plaintiff would also make a claim for past and future loss of earning capacity.
	


Past and future loss of earning capacity


	
	The plaintiff’s submissions were that she suffered significant loss of earning capacity which has the capacity to affect her work, and will continue to do so (T 159). Prior to the accident the plaintiff described herself as having “a full and effective working life” and that she intended “to continue to build a career in the hospitality industry” (affidavit, paragraph 67). As a result of her accident she was unable to resume her studies at Swinburne University until 2014.
	
	
	There is a concession by the defendant that the plaintiff can establish past economic loss in relation to the period of time when she was unable to work, namely 22 weeks. The defendant’s submissions were that the plaintiff’s net weekly earnings are uncertain, as what little information there is about past earnings suggests the figure of about $700 per week, resulting in a maximum of $15,400. No specific figure to the contrary was put by Mr Thompson, so I accept this as correct.
	
	
	This brings me to the question of what the plaintiff’s working history was, both before and after the accident. The plaintiff describes herself on her Instagram account as “globetrotter, dressage rider, CMO, student, philanthropist” (Exhibit 3). The plaintiff does in fact hold positions in which some of these are described as her occupations.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s work history prior to the accident is sketchy, and she conceded that she has in fact earned more every year since the accident, although she said she was no longer earning tips in the hospitality industry (T 129). The plaintiff also had unpaid work as the founder of a charity in Kenya, which she runs under the name of “Genevieve Audrey”. She describes herself on the website as follows:
	


“Genevieve Audrey B Psych (Swin) Dip F P; Dip F S, Founder and CEO

Our founder and CEO, Genevieve is …currently studying full-time at a university in Australia, while also working. Her experience is in marketing sales, media publications, financial services and law. She manages the Foundation in Australia and Kenya, connecting with the team every evening and returns to Nairobi as often as possible” (Exhibit 1, page 1179)


	
	A photograph of the plaintiff appears beside this statement. She is also described as providing marketing, media, advertising and financial assistance on a permanent basis.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s activities for this foundation are relevant for two reasons. The first is that it is an organisation with DGR status she is helping to fund and run, and her wish to do so is relevant when considering her future economic loss:
	


“Q. How is it funded?

A. It's been funded by some of the commissions I was earning and some local donations.

Q. So it's funded from your income?

A. Little bits of my income. I've put about $10,000 in two years into it, and also from donations from external sources into the trust account, as it has DGR status.” (T 129)


	
	The second reason is that the plaintiff’s activities in Kenya cast doubt on the plaintiff’s evidence in that, although the social media documents describe her current status differently, she is not unemployed due to mental illness:
	


“Q. How much of your time do you spend in Kenya?

A. I've spent probably about ten weeks there in total in the last two years.

Q. What's your current employment?

A. I'm not employed.

Q. When did you cease to be employed?

A. I ceased employment at the end of last year due to mental health reasons.

Q. Unrelated to this accident?

A. Related to this accident.

Q. Where's the medical evidence of that?

A. There is countless documentation—” (T 130)


	
	Mr Renshaw called for these reports on a number of occasions during these proceedings:
	


“RENSHAW: The constant answer, contrary to due forensic process in these courts, has been that, in respect of documents, they're not here. This situation impedes the proper administration of justice and the conduct of cross‑examination, and I ask that your Honour make the peremptory order that, if such a document doesn't exist, it be frankly stated by my learned friend that it doesn't.

HER HONOUR: Yes. Mr Thompson, what do you say to that?

THOMPSON: Putting aside the humorous and bombastic comments my friend has made, my friend has not made a legitimate call. He has called for the documents that relate to incapacity or disability, words to that effect. He's put no time frame on it. Presumably we're required to go back to the year dot. Perhaps my friend can frame his request in more precise terms and I'll endeavour to get instructions.” (T 131)


	
	Mr Renshaw then asked the plaintiff if she had in fact resigned from her positions in Australia in order to spend more time in Kenya:
	


“Q. In your post on Facebook, time line dated 22 December 2015, you state - this is in the affidavit, not cross‑examined on by my instructing solicitor, at paragraph 38, ""Home time!!! Tell the girls, as I said, I don't make promises I can't keep. So, as promised, I quit my job, and..(not transcribable)..had the baby..(not transcribable)..and I'll be home just in time for Christmas, 23 hours and counting."" So you've quit your job?

A. I had to quit my job.

Q. Well, the context in that posting is that because of a promise you made, you quit your job?

A. I was already going to quit my job. I quit my job back in September, and for the benefit of my clients at that company, I stayed until December.”


	
	The first report produced in answer to this call (that of a psychiatrist, Dr Mark Ryan, dated 3 October 2011 – T 135) was of no assistance, as it was prepared less than two months after the plaintiff’s accident. A report of 8 June 2012 from Dr Symboluk, who treated the plaintiff until mid-2012, was similarly of little assistance, although it did record the plaintiff telling her she “attempted to take her life by driving her scooter into a car, which resulted in her being hospitalised and having several surgeries on her ankle, and court appearances”, a statement the plaintiff said was “untrue” (Exhibit 13, T 143).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim that the accident had impeded her scholastic career was also difficult to maintain, given the uncertainty as to the qualifications she held herself out as either having or studying towards. The plaintiff acknowledged she did not have the qualifications that “Genevieve Audrey” held herself out as having in the website extract set out above:
	


“Q. You don't have any academic qualifications at all, do you?

A. I haven't finished the‑‑

Q. You haven't got any academic qualifications at all, have you?

A. No.

Q. Any representation by you is dishonest, isn't it, that you do have them?

A. I have my Diploma of Mortgage Broking and Financial Planning, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Psychology, but I am yet to complete it.” (T 136)


	
	She also acknowledged, after first saying she did not recall it, that she had been excluded from the Solicitors Admissions Board (T 124 – 6). This also appears to be unrelated to the accident.
	
	
	The plaintiff has, from this evidence, made a complete recovery from her injuries. She is physically very fit and her pre-existing psychiatric problems appear to be continuing as before. There is no medical evidence to suggest to the contrary. No claim for future economic loss can be made out.
	


Out of pocket expenses


	
	I have very little information about the plaintiff’s past out of pocket expenses and none at all about what her future expenses would be. If I assume a reasonable figure for her hospitalisation, operation and subsequent medication, it would be a general guess only. It would have been helpful if I had been given a schedule. A figure of about $10,000 would be reasonable.
	
	
	The plaintiff has, in my view, no claim for future out of pocket expenses. There is no evidence in relation to ongoing medication. Her treatment, about which I have no details, relates to her pre-existing psychiatric problems.
	


Contributory negligence


	
	When determining the threshold on an application for extension of time, a consideration of matters relating to contributory negligence is relevant: Reeves at [16]; Eades v Gunestepe [2012] NSWCA 204 (“Eades”). The correct approach does not, however, require the judge hearing the application to determine a percentage. In Eades, Hoeben JA defined the task as determining whether there was a “real and not remote chance or possibility” of contributory negligence as set out in Eades at [41] – [45].
	
	
	Mr Thompson submits (written outline, paragraphs 12 – 13) that the principle in Reeves does not operate in circumstances where there is a blanket denial of liability on the basis that the plaintiff deliberately caused the accident, as such a finding can only operate to bar the plaintiff’s success on her claim. The court is required to operate on the assumption that the claim succeeds (s 109(3)(b) of the Act).
	
	
	I do not accept that the “suicide” evidence should be wholly discounted for such a reason. There is frequently a “clear conflict” (Eades  at [38]) of evidence as to the circumstances of an accident relating not simply to liability but also (and this is the sole basis for considering it here) on the basis of contributory negligence. Other evidence relevant to contributory negligence, such as the plaintiff’s level of intoxication, may also be taken into account.
	
	
	Any discount for contributory negligence would be high, as the plaintiff was riding a scooter late at night, affected by alcohol, in circumstances where the defendant said he was unable to see her. If the defendant were found liable and the trial judge was satisfied that the plaintiff was indeed trying to kill herself, the contributory negligence component would be very substantial; Mr Renshaw submitted it could amount to 100%.
	


Other issues


	
	As the exercise under s 109 requires me to assume that the plaintiff will be successful in relation to liability issues, it is not appropriate for me to determine issues of credibility. Any statements I have made as to any inconsistency between the plaintiff’s evidence and contemporaneous evidence should be read in this light.
	


Conclusions concerning the s 109(3)(b) threshold


	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff would be awarded only a sum of under $20,000 for past economic loss. I cannot see that she would be awarded even a cushion for future economic loss given her sporting prowess. The amount she would be awarded for past out of pockets would be in the region of $10,000.
	
	
	Even if these sums had been significantly larger, and an award made for non-economic loss, the very significant percentage which would be likely to be awarded for contributory negligence would make it impossible for the plaintiff to reach the threshold.
	
	
	Having noted these findings I next consider whether the plaintiff has provided a full and satisfactory explanation.
	


A “full” explanation


	
	The correct approach to take to whether an explanation is “full” is summarised in Dijakovic v Perez at [15] – [17]:
	


“[15] An explanation is “full and satisfactory” within s 66(2) if it satisfies two requirements. These were explained by Meagher JA (Basten JA and Simpson J agreeing) in Karambelas v Zaknic (No 2) (2014) 69 MVR 127; [2014] NSWCA 433 at [16] (Karambelas).

[16] First, it must include a full account of the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant, from the date of the accident until “the date of providing the explanation”. In the case of late proceedings under s 109(1) that is the date on which the explanation is first provided. Here, Mr Dijakovic’s explanation comprised a combination of affidavit evidence and his oral evidence before the primary judge. Thus he had to explain the period between 21 October 2009 and 30 May 2014.

[17] The purpose of the requirement that the explanation be full, and the necessity to set out fully “the conduct, including the actions, knowledge and belief of the claimant”, is so that the court can evaluate all of the reasons for the delay and decide whether they are full and satisfactory: Mancini v Thompson [2002] NSWCA 38 at [46]. (Mancini). It is for this reason that it has been said that the applicant for leave cannot “pick and choose” the information to be given relevant to the delay and which the court has to decide is “satisfactory”: Mancini at [46].”


	
	The plaintiff’s explanation is not full, particularly in relation to the following:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s generalised position is that she has a long history of pre-accident and psychological disorder and the reasonableness of her inaction must, as was the case in Dijakovic v Perez, be viewed accordingly. However, I am satisfied that the plaintiff was aware of the time limits in personal injury proceedings in a general way by reason of her statement to Slater & Gordon that she “did lodge a claim form with the CTP insurer” (Exhibit 1 p. 331) and that the plaintiff has not given a full description of her conduct, knowledge and belief in this regard.
	
	
	The plaintiff does not provide, in her affidavit, any account at all of her actions, knowledge or belief for the period March 2013 to June 2014, or any explanation beyond her psychiatric problems, for the period.
	



	
	Mr Thompson (written submissions, paragraph 9) points to the report of Professor Janice Russell of 4 June 2013 which states that the plaintiff’s employment abilities and stability are “severely disrupted” for “the foreseeable future”, but does not address the issue of how this interacts with her ability to bring a claim for damages. Nor does this report absolve the plaintiff of the obligation to provide a description of her conduct, knowledge or belief as to her entitlements, particularly since it is clear she was aware in 2012 she had lodged a CTP claim form. Professor Russell’s report, and the plaintiff’s history of requiring psychiatric assistance, do not provide a basis for a “full” explanation for the plaintiff’s failure to seek help from the many skilled professionals offering her assistance in dealing with her problems. The question of what a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would do is simply not addressed at all.
	
	
	While I accept that there is a “full” explanation for the period after which Ms Charleston was retained (1 July 2014), in that the plaintiff was seeking legal advice, the failure to provide any explanation for the period before that, beyond a generalised claim of the plaintiff being psychiatrically incapable of taking the necessary steps (unsupported by either information or medical evidence) cannot amount to a “full” explanation.
	


A “satisfactory” explanation


	
	What is the standard by which the satisfactoriness of the plaintiff’s explanation must be assessed? In Lyu v Jeon [2012] NSWCA 446 at [22] – [25], Meagher JA explained the requirement for the explanation to be “satisfactory” in circumstances where, as is the case here, it is not easy to determine the extent to which the characteristics of the person in question are to be attributed to the “reasonable person”:
	


“[22] In Diaz v Truong, Giles JA said (at [42]) of the equivalent provision in s 40(2) of the Motor Accident Act 1988:

The standard of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant failing to comply with a duty is understandable. The standard of a reasonable person in the position of the claimant being “justified in experiencing” a delay is more obscure. Experiencing something normally means being subjected to it, the object of acts or omissions by another or others. What is meant by being justified in experiencing a delay? It must mean that the reasonable person in the position of the claimant would have been subjected to the delay and the subjection to the delay would have been justified. The hypothetical experiencing of delay must have the quality of a justified experiencing of delay.

That elucidation of what being “justified in experiencing” a delay means is not controversial: see Russo v Aiello [2003] HCA 53 ; 215 CLR 643 at [7], [73]; Buller v Black [2003] NSWCA 45 ; 56 NSWLR 425at [46], [94], [100]; Walker v Howard esp at [96]–[97], [101]–[102].

[23] As Allsop P explained in Walker v Howard (esp at [64], [68], [69], [90], [97]), the test so expressed is a construct for the making of the evaluative judgment or assessment as to whether, given the claimant’s position, the delay which occurred was reasonably justifiable; that question to be answered by asking whether a reasonable person in the claimant’s position would have experienced that delay. It requires that characteristics and circumstances of the claimant be taken into account when applying the objective standard. In some cases it will not be easy to determine the extent to which the characteristics of the person in question are to be attributed to the “reasonable person” because those characteristics may not sit comfortably with the notion of the “reasonable person”. The present is not such a case.

[24] Two further matters are, however, relevant in the present context. First, as Gleeson CJ observed in Russo v Aiello (at [5], [7]), what will constitute justifiable delay on the part of a reasonable person in making a claim is to be considered in the light of the legislative purposes of the MAC Act. See also [74] per Gummow and Hayne JJ. Those purposes include encouraging the early investigation, assessment and resolution of claims so as to advance the interests of claimants in having prompt treatment and rehabilitation, and in having the prompt payment of lost earnings; and so as to advance the interests of insurers in more accurately predicting claims frequency and formulating premiums. The Act seeks to achieve these objects by the imposition on both claimants and insurers of time limits and obligations to act expeditiously: see also Walker v Howard per Allsop P at [90].

[25] Secondly, as Gleeson CJ also observed in Russo v Aiello at [7]:

… what the Act requires is justification for delay; not demonstration that the delay caused no harm. … the focus of the statutory concept of a satisfactory explanation is upon justifying delay, rather than excusing it. It is one thing to say that conduct is justified by reference to the way in which a reasonable person in the position of a claimant could have been expected to behave. It is another thing to say that delay ought to be excused because it caused no identifiable harm to an insurer. It is the former, not the latter, question that is raised for consideration.”


	
	Although these remarks relate to other provisions in the legislation, these remarks are apposite, in that they underline the missing factual elements in this application. The concept of a satisfactory explanation requires the making of an evaluative judgment or assessment as to whether, by reference to an objective standard and given the claimant’s evidence, the delay to the time that proceedings were commenced was reasonably justifiable.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s explanation is not satisfactory in relation to the following:
	



	
	The mere fact that a person suffers from psychological/psychiatric disorder, whether prior to the accident or not, should not be a sufficient basis for that person to be excused from compliance with the statutory provisions designed to ensure that motor accident claims are brought promptly. Many persons making claims suffer serious injuries without those being the cause of failure to comply, and a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position, who was aware in a general sense that there were time limits, would not have been inactive simply by reason of her pre-existing disorders.
	
	
	Unlike the plaintiff in Dijakovic v Perez, who did not understand (and thus seek help) about the disorder leading to his avoidant behaviour, the plaintiff had a series of dedicated professionals who were available to assist her in coping with this problem.
	
	
	The plaintiff had the benefit of some legal training in the form of legal studies, was well-educated and able to appreciate the importance of complying with time limits, as the existence of which she was put on notice during her consultations with Slater & Gordon. A reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would have opened the letters addressed to her, as that person would have known they were not follow-up letters but confirmation of an important appointment, as well as repetition of earlier advice and warnings that there were significant time restraints in the legislation.
	



	
	For the above reasons, the explanation is not satisfactory. It is not uncommon for an injured plaintiff to demonstrate “avoidant” (Dijakovic v Perez at [87]) behaviour towards the obtaining of legal advice, or to be in denial about injuries. In Dijakovic v Perez the plaintiff ignored communications from his solicitors for twelve to sixteen months, conduct which was explainable by medical evidence tendered on his behalf, and which included the plaintiff’s failure to seek treatment for the psychiatric problems which triggered this avoidant behaviour.
	
	
	However, it is unwise to rely upon apparent similarities in factual situations; each case must turn on its facts. In the present case, a reasonable person in the place of the plaintiff, with all her advantages of education and skilled health professionals to advise her, would not have acted in the way that she did. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has not given either a “full and satisfactory” explanation.
	
	
	At the commencement of these proceedings, Mr Renshaw sought summary findings on the basis of estoppel. I indicated that I would give reasons in my judgment for my refusal to hear the application summarily and I have set these out below.
	


Estoppel per rem judicatam


	
	The defendant also seeks summary dismissal on the basis of estoppel per rem judicatam arising from the consent judgment entered in the Local Court for the full amount claimed by the defendant for motor vehicle property damage plus interest and costs.
	
	
	When the proceedings brought by the defendant for property vehicle damage were listed for hearing, the plaintiff, representing herself, signed consent orders requiring her to pay the amount claimed in full. The question is the impact of the words “without admission of liability”, which were added to the consent orders by the duty solicitor present in court that day, who gave her some legal advice.
	
	
	The plaintiff does not challenge the submission that a judgment by consent such as consent orders can operate as an estoppel (as to which, see Spencer Bower and Handley, “Res Judicata”, 4th ed. (LexisNexis Butterworth), at 2.16; for more recent considerations of this issue see Chamberlain v DCT (1988) 164 CLR 502 (although that was a case of res judicata or cause of action estoppel); Makhoul v Barnes (1995) 60 FCR 572 at 582 and Conference & Exhibition Organisers Pty Ltd v Johnson [2016] NSWCA 118 at [34]). However, the plaintiff submits that the judgment agreed to on 5 April 2013 was “secured expressly subject to there being no determination of liability” (Outline of submissions, paragraph 19) and that the words “without admission as to liability” mean that decisions such as Tiufino v Warland and Charafeddine v Morgan can be distinguished, in that the issue estoppel arise as a result of a judgment obtained after a hearing and determination on the evidence.
	
	
	I first set out my reasons for not dealing with this submission on a summary basis. The first is that the extent to which a consent judgment may give rise to issue estoppels “has not been finally determined”, as Spencer Bower and Handley note at 2.16 and caution must be exercised. The second, and more important, is the need, not only in the circumstances of this case but generally where such a submission is made, for careful examination of the evidence. Observations as to the importance of considering the evidence in the case was considered “absolutely essential” by Street CJ and Roper CJ in Eq, in Isaacs v The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation Ltd and Winslett (1958) 58 NSWR 69, their Honours setting out the following extract from Spencer Bower on Res Judicata (at p 114 para 174):
	


“In the case of judgments and orders by consent ... it is absolutely essential to refer to the pleadings or affidavits of the parties, if the judgment or order is in a naked and general form, in order to ascertain what, if any, decision of particular questions or issues was impliedly consented or submitted to by the party against whom such consent ... judgment or order was made.”


	
	While the test of whether a consent judgment gives rise to an issue estoppel is objective, the need for the court to examine “all evidence that is available and admissible and with the aid of such material ascertain any and what adjudication of matters in dispute was expressly or necessarily involved in the actual decision assented to” was emphasised more recently by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ekes v Commonwealth Bank of Australia at [112] – [114] (“Ekes”).
	
	
	Examination of the pleadings and evidence in the Local Court confirms that, apart from the fact that these proceedings resulted in consent orders rather than a hearing, the case is consistent with Charafeddine v Morgan. Mr Thompson’s submissions on relevant factual issues essentially rely upon the plaintiff’s state of mind and reliance, as a litigant in person, on the duty solicitor who added the words “without admission of liability”.
	
	
	As to the first, the subjective state of mind of a party is not the issue (Ekes at [115]). I also note that the plaintiff did not expressly reserve her rights in personal injury proceedings; to the contrary, her evidence is that she was unaware of those rights (this is relevant to the “without admission of liability” argument set out in more detail below).
	
	
	As to Mr Thompson’s second submission, in Charafeddine v Morgan the defendant in the Local Court property damage claim was also self-represented (as noted at [112]), although she had legal assistance with the drafting of her defence, and this was not a sufficient factor to amount to “special circumstances” (an argument I note was not raised in these proceedings in any event).
	
	
	For the same reasons as in Charafeddine, the relationship between motor vehicle property damage claims in the Local Court and personal injury claims gives rise to an issue estoppel on the question of negligence, namely, that the plaintiff had breached her duty of care to the defendant (Charafeddine at [16]). As the full amount was paid, the issue of contributory negligence may also be taken to have been determined.
	


“Without admission of liability”


	
	The plaintiff’s real argument is that there is no estoppel because of the insertion of the words “without admission of liability” into the consent orders.
	
	
	The defendant counters this submission by referring to Ashenden v Stewarts & Lloyds [1972] 2 NSWLR 484 (“Ashenden”), where the words “without admission of liability” were inconsistent (per Taylor AJA) or repugnant (per Hardie AJA) to the rest of the settlement and therefore of no effect. The plaintiff responds that this decision is restricted to the limitations of the Workers’ Compensation Commission and has no general application.
	
	
	There is some force in the plaintiff’s submissions, for the reasons explained by P W Taylor SC, Senior Member AATA, in Liang v Secretary, Dept of Social Services [2015] AATA 275 at [23]:
	


“In judicial fora there is a practice of obtaining judgments or orders that are expressly recorded as having been made “without admission of liability“. There is substantial authority for the view that orders or judgments of that kind do not give rise to any relevant estoppel in relation to the points at issue in the proceedings: see Isaacs v Ocean Accident & Guarantee Corporation Ltd & Winslett (1958) SR (NSW) 69 and Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd v Harbord (1997) 69 SASR 75 at 91. But the authorities are not all one way. Where a particular decision maker’s jurisdiction or powers depend upon satisfaction about a particular event or state of affairs, the power cannot be conferred by an agreement made “without admissions”: see Ashenden v Stewarts & Lloyds (Australia) Ltd [1972] 2 NSWLR 484.”


	
	However, when determining whether an estoppel arises, the principles enunciated in Ashenden have been considered in a number of decisions outside the parameters of workers’ compensation proceedings, such as in Lord v Dernacourt Investments Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McLelland CJ in Eq, 14 March 1994, unreported). These authorities are analysed and explained by Bergin J (as her Honour then was) in Rhodes v Fletcher [2002] NSWSC 637. Her Honour states (at [40]) that, to the extent that these qualifying words are inconsistent with the implicit admission of the existence of any necessary condition of the Court's power to make the order, they are ineffective, the more so in the case of a final order.
	
	
	As is noted above, the plaintiff was not reserving her rights as to any claims for personal injury damages, because I consider she was unaware of those rights at the time of consenting to the settlement. The words were a mere legal flourish.
	


Conclusions concerning estoppel per rem judicatam


	
	I am satisfied that the defendant’s full uncompromised recovery of all damages from the plaintiff in the Local Court precludes any recovery (including contributory negligence) by the plaintiff and that the words “without admission of liability” were surplusage. Accordingly, in addition to dismissing the plaintiff’s application under s 109, I find that the defendant has established Estoppel per rem judicatam.
	


Costs and other issues


	
	Costs should follow the event. I grant liberty to restore for any variation of this order in the event that any application for alternative costs orders is to be made.
	
	
	The complexity of what would otherwise have been a straightforward application under s 109 was complicated by the extensive material, the unusual nature of the challenge to the plaintiff’s application, and by two applications made in the course of the trial for which I made rulings on the understanding that I would give reasons in this judgment.
	
	
	First, Mr Renshaw, during the hearing of these proceedings, said that his client would seek a referral of these proceedings to the Director of Public Prosecutions. He pointed to the absence of medical evidence and the asserted dishonesty of the plaintiff in her evidence, and asked me to make an order in this regard. I indicated to Mr Renshaw that I would prefer any such application to be made after I handed down judgment, rather than be the subject of submissions in the proceedings, and that I would set out my reasons for this determination in my judgment.
	
	
	Referrals of a witness or party to the Department of Public Prosecutions by a judge during or even after a hearing are rarely made, and still more rarely acted upon. Both the absence of a statutory-based procedure and the reluctance of the court to make such orders other than in the clearest of cases are evident from the very few judgments recording the bringing of such applications (see for example Adeeb v Alali [2013] NSWSC 312). There is also the risk of error of discretion by the trial judge, resulting in the requirement for appellate clarification: Dai v Zhu [2013] NSWCA 412.
	
	
	There is no single legislative pathway for such a step. I am aware of specific legislation being enacted in 2015 in the United Kingdom and the United States in relation to “fundamental dishonesty” (to use the terminology in s 57 Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 (UK)) in personal injury litigation, and of the amendments to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Court Procedure in the United States by the Law Abuse Reduction Act (LARA) 2015 (HR 758, S 401), but these were controversial reforms which have no parallel in this jurisdiction.
	
	
	There are a number of ways that such a request can be put before the court, ranging from requests to commence a private prosecution under s 338(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Mohareb v Palmer [2015] NSWCA 369) to an application to the Registrar (Application of Alejandro Arturo Toro-Martinez [2008] NSWSC 34) or to the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court. These differing provisions merely underline the difficulties for any trial judge who is also called upon to make findings of fact for other purposes (for an example in relation to personal injury, see Glover v Australian Ultra Concrete Floors Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 503). This is all the more the case where an application is foreshadowed or brought during (as opposed to after) the proceedings. That does not, however, prevent the defendant from bringing any such application as it sees fit after judgment is handed down.
	
	
	Second, in the course of the hearing, Mr Thompson sought a s 128 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) certificate in relation to certain evidence the plaintiff gave, both in her affidavit and in cross-examination, which she later conceded was untrue.
	
	
	Conformably with the reasoning in Clayton Utz v Dale [2015] VSCA 186 at [116] I did not grant such a certificate because, while the privilege against self-incrimination may be available to a plaintiff on issues of credit or on collateral issues in a proceeding, that is not the case with respect to the issues that form the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim.
	


Orders


	
	Summons filed on 31 August 2015 dismissed.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs.
	
	
	Liberty to restore in relation to costs and to any other post-judgment application.

		30 May 2016",2016-05-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701562,R v Whittall [2016] NSWSC 691,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The accused, Laine Elizabeth Whittall, is charged with the murder of Kevin James Fawcett at Gosford on 7 July 2014. A trial date has not yet been fixed.
	
	
	A question has been raised as to the accused's fitness to be tried for the offence. This is an inquiry as to whether or not she is unfit to be tried. The provisions of Pt 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 apply.
	
	
	The question of whether a person is fit to be tried is determined in accordance with the well-known criteria set out in R v Presser [1958] VR 45. Also relevant is the issue raised in the High Court in Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230.
	
	
	The accused is represented in these proceedings by Mr Todd of counsel. Tendered, without objection, were five reports written by two forensic psychiatrists.
	
	
	Dr Anthony Samuels, who was engaged on behalf of the accused, provided a report dated 24 April 2015 arising from his consultation with the accused on that date and his review of various documentary material. In this report he said:
	


“Taking into account the R v Presser [1958] VR 45 criteria, it is my view that, although Ms Whittall appears superficially to meet many of the Presser standards, I believe she is currently unfit to stand trial and it is very likely that her persecutory delusional ideation and elevated mood state will impact upon her ability to give appropriate instructions to her solicitor, to trust her solicitor to act in her interests, and may also impact upon the type of plea that she is likely to make. I think it is likely that following a period of treatment in a declared mental health facility her mental state will improve and that in the course of the next six to twelve months she will become fit to proceed to trial.

In addition, at the present time taking into account Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230, it is likely that fluctuations in her mental state currently will severely interrupt the trial process.""


	
	Dr Samuels provided a further report dated 28 August 2015 following his interview with the accused that date. Dr Samuels noted that he had been contacted by the accused's solicitor, a very experienced solicitor in these matters employed by Legal Aid New South Wales, who indicated that she considered that the accused may now be fit to plead and asked Dr Samuels to reassess the situation. In this report, Dr Samuels concluded as follows:
	


“I have reviewed the components of the Presser criteria with Ms Whittall and I am satisfied that she is currently fit to stand trial and in regards to Kesavarajah criteria she should be able to tolerate the trial process. Her mental state, however, remains somewhat fragile and unstable from time to time and she may need a break from the court proceedings. It is quite possible that if she is cross-examined she could become very distressed and if called to testify she may require frequent breaks.""


	
	The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions engaged Dr Jeremy O'Dea to report on the issue of the accused's fitness or otherwise and he interviewed the accused on 1 November 2015. The result of his interview and his review of certain documentary material is set out in his report of 15 February 2016. Dr O'Dea said:
	


“I have diagnosed Ms Whittall as suffering from a Bipolar Affective Disorder with a current manic episode characterised by, amongst other symptoms and signs, an elevated affect, pressured speech, flight of ideas and paranoid delusions, at least regarding prison officers and Justice Health staff with a differential diagnosis of a Schizo-Affective Disorder.

In addition, Ms Whittall has a history of a Substance Use Disorder, including amphetamine and heroin use disorders.

…

… [A]t the time of my interview on 1 November 2015, she presented as manic, with ongoing elevated affect, pressured speech, flight of ideas, and at least residual paranoia; with this manic episode only partially responsive to treatment to date.

As such, and taking into consideration the Presser criteria, I would have significant concerns regarding Ms Whittall's fitness, from a psychiatric perspective, to be tried.

...

… [D]ue to her current manic mental state, I would have significant concerns regarding her ability to concentrate, think clearly and logically, and to exercise behavioural control and judgment, in order to adequately follow the Court proceedings and to instruct her solicitors accordingly. In addition, I would have significant concerns regarding her ability to cope with the stress of the Court proceedings with the significant risk of further exacerbation of her Bipolar Disorder through such a process at the present time.

As such, and on balance, I would consider that at least at the time of my assessment on 1 November 2015, Ms Whittall was not fit, from a psychiatric perspective, to be tried.

However, with more assertive psychiatric treatment, including with admission to a secure forensic psychiatric facility for more intensive, and long-term, psychiatric treatment of her Bipolar Affective Disorder, I would be optimistic regarding the likelihood of her condition improving further and to the extent that she would become fit, from a psychiatric perspective, to be tried within the next 12 months.""


	
	Dr Samuels saw the accused again on 18 March 2016, albeit via audiovisual link. He had been provided with a copy of the report of Dr O'Dea of 15 February 2016. In his report dated 29 March 2016, he said:
	


“Ms Whittall's mental state is much improved but has not entirely stabilised. She acknowledges that her current level of anxiety is a problem. Ms Whittall is very keen to be found fit and to go to Court and for the trial proceedings to move forwards.

… My main concern in relation to her fitness relates to the question of her 'being able to make her defence or answer to the charge', and as to whether she is able to follow the course of the proceedings and to be able to understand what is going on in the Court in a general sense. The fact that she is desperate to be found fit and stated 'I don't want to let my solicitor down either' raises further concerns in my mind that she is trying to portray herself as being better than she actually is. These concerns are compounded by the fact that by her own admission her mental state fluctuates significantly in the course of a week.

In terms of Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230 criteria, I have additional concerns and it is very likely that in the course of a lengthy trial, fluctuations in her mental state could impact upon her ability to participate in the proceedings.

It is possible that with further, more assertive, treatment and a further review of her medication including use of additional mood stabilisers, further improvements and stabilisation of her mental state could occur. At this point I would regard her as being unfit to be tried.""


	
	Dr O'Dea saw the accused again on 25 May 2016. In his report on 27 May 2016, he said:
	


“It would appear that Ms Whittall has responded well to the ongoing psychiatric treatment program in custody, including the recent change of medication to Zyprexa, with improvement in her affect, attention and concentration, anxiety management and general thinking and composure.

However, despite this improvement, she remains somewhat elevated and irritable in affect with continued vulnerability in her thinking and overall stress management, with her Bipolar Affective Disorder yet to come under adequate control.

As such, and as before, and taking into consideration the Presser criteria and the potential impact of the specific stressor of a trial on Ms Whittall's mental state, I would consider that Ms Whittall remains unfit to be tried at the present time.

However, with continued assertive psychiatric treatment including continuation of the current psychiatric medication and consideration of ongoing psychiatric treatment in a secure psychiatric hospital, I would remain optimistic regarding the likelihood of her condition improving further and to the extent that she would become fit, from a psychiatric perspective, to be tried, within the next 12 months.”


	
	I was informed by Mr Todd this morning that Dr Samuels had seen the accused this morning and remained of the view he expressed in his last report.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor, in helpful written submissions, has indicated that the anticipated length of this trial would be three to four weeks and the issues anticipated at trial would be whether the accused should be found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, or whether the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind might be made out.
	
	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the medical evidence unanimously supported a finding that the accused is currently unfit to be tried. Mr Todd, on behalf of the accused, has accepted the correctness of that concession by the Crown.
	
	
	I am of the view that the concession is both fair and soundly based. Accordingly, I conclude that the accused is currently unfit to be tried.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	


1.   Pursuant to s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, (""The Act"") I find that the accused, Laine Whittall, is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder;

2.   In accordance with s 14 of the Act, I refer the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal;

3.   Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of the Act, I remand the accused in custody pending further orders of the Court;

4.   I direct the registry to provide the following documents to the Mental Health Review Tribunal:

(a) copy of this judgment;

(b) copy of the exhibits tendered to this inquiry;

(c) copy of the indictment and the Crown Case Statement;

(d) copy of the written submissions of the Crown Prosecutor.

	On the same day Judge Johnstone sentenced him in respect of three other offences from which no appeal is brought.
	
	
	The young person now appeals against the sentence imposed. The appeal comes to this Court by reason of s 22A of the Children’s Court Act 1987 (NSW). The young person needs leave to appeal because the appeal was not filed within the time limited by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The Crown does not oppose leave being given. I am satisfied from the affidavit of Jeremy Styles, the solicitor acting for the young person, that leave should be given.
	
	
	It is not necessary to set out the exhaustive detail of the circumstances of each of the offences. In relation to the 13 offences in H 57849712 the offences involved the entry into various residential properties by force normally resulting in damage to the property, ransacking the property and in some cases causing other damage. In most cases personal items including money were stolen. In most cases the young person was in company with one or more other persons.
	
	
	The offence of aggravated break and enter and commit larceny in circumstances of aggravation concerned a property where the occupants of the house were present. They did not realise the young person and others were in the house until just after they had left.
	
	
	The offence of resisting an officer in the execution of the officer’s duty took place when the police attended at the place the young person was living because he had outstanding warrants for his arrest. When the police knocked loudly on the door and announced themselves the young person and others jumped out of a rear window. Police called to him but he ran from them. He was tackled, restrained, handcuffed and placed under arrest. However, when he was being searched he ran from them again. The police gave chase but when he was tackled to the ground he continued to struggle and lash out at them.
	
	
	A report from Juvenile Justice indicated that the young person is of Aboriginal heritage and is the third child of eight children born to his mother. She has been the main carer for him since her relationship with the young person’s father came to an end when he was about eight years of age. The young person described a materially adequate and supportive upbringing. He said that his mother provides the care and support needed and he had a positive relationship with his siblings. The young person found it difficult to accept the boundaries imposed by his mother but she indicated that she was not able to control him nor assist him to modify his behaviour. The report indicated the young person had been suspended from Airds High School due to a display of problematic behaviours outside the class environment. If released from custody the Principal indicated that the young person would be able to return to the school where he would be supported by the Aboriginal Liaison Officer.
	
	
	The report indicated that the young person had a history of associating with older peers who appeared to support and actively engage in antisocial activities. Both the young person’s mother and stepfather reported that he was easily influenced by his peers because he sought to impress them by participating in antisocial behaviour.
	
	
	In a number of places the report indicated that the young person initially engaged with people and organisations endeavouring to give him support including Juvenile Justice and Youth Off The Streets but after a short period of time the young person disengaged.
	
	
	Although the Juvenile Justice report indicated that the young person was eligible and suited a community based order they said he was not considered suitable for a Community Service Order partly because of his young age and partly because of the difficulty in his understanding the rules associated with Community Service Orders. The report indicated that if he was to be released from custody he would be able to live with his mother and that was the only suitable accommodation for him. His mother had indicated a willingness and desire to have him at home.
	
	
	The young person was examined by forensic psychologist Ms Caroline Hare on 24 April 2016. What she reported of his background accorded with what was contained in the Juvenile Justice report. It indicated further that the young person had an amicable relationship with his stepfather although that relationship with the young person’s mother appears to have come to an end. The psychologist reported that he had spent some time residing with his maternal aunt in Brisbane for a few weeks. This was an attempt by his mother to distance him from the negative peer group that he was associating with. The psychologist then reported that he was reluctant to provide further information about his family life saying that he felt “weird to have [his] personal life on show”. He did however deny exposure to any racism or other social disadvantage and said that his material needs were apparently consistently met during his childhood.
	
	
	The only negative things reported were that the young person’s father had spent some time in gaol and although the young person had not been exposed to familial substance abuse he said he was extensively exposed to alcohol use within the local community. He had observed arguments between his mother and his stepfather but there was no suggestion of physical violence.
	
	
	The young person informed the psychologist that he had consumed alcohol and smoked cannabis on occasions since the age of 14 years in the company of peers. He said that smoking cannabis had led him to committing acquisitive offences because after smoking it he would want to smoke more and would need money to do this. He denied using other drugs.
	
	
	The psychologist said that he met criteria for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder. The psychologist noted that he had been placed on Concerta for the ADHD and he reported improved concentration and enhanced ability to listen. He said the medication helped him make the right choices. This treatment appears to have commenced whilst he has been in custody.
	
	
	The psychologist identified him as having cognitive delays in the following areas:
	


Emotional regulation;

Executive functioning;

Cognitive flexibility;

Social skills; and

Language processing.


	
	He struggled to engage in individual counselling sessions and discharged himself from them.
	
	
	The psychometric testing showed that he fell in the first percentile of the population meaning that his intellectual abilities were in the Extremely Low to Borderline range. Similarly, his General Adaptive Composite fell below the 0.1 percentile. These results indicated that he met the criteria for Mild Intellectual Disability.
	
	
	The psychologist concluded:
	


He experiences difficulties in learning academic skills involving reading, writing, arithmetic, time, and money, and requires support to meet age-related expectations. He adopts a concrete approach to problem solving when compared to his peers. His problems in the social domain indicate that he is immature in social interactions, and he may experience difficulties accurately perceiving social cues. Communication, conversation, and language are more concrete or immature than expected for his age. RC is likely to experience difficulties regulating his emotion and behaviour in an age-appropriate fashion. He has limited understanding of risk in social situations and his social judgement is immature for age, meaning that he is at increased susceptibility to peer influence and manipulation. RC likely requires support with complex daily living tasks in comparison with his peers. Whilst he is probably able to engage in recreational activities with his age-mates, he is less able to organise recreational activities in the absence of support, meaning that he would benefit maximally from a structured routine.


	
	The psychologist also concluded that extended detention within a juvenile justice facility had the potential to heighten some areas of the challenges he experiences as this detention would increase his exposure to potentially negatively influencing peers. She said, on the other hand, that the predictable structure offered by the regime operating within a juvenile justice facility would likely offer him some benefits as he struggles to manage in the absence of a structured routine. She was concerned that his extended detention would increase his vulnerability to developing signs of institutionalisation. She said in order to promote his rehabilitation she believed he would benefit from reintegrating into the community with a plan of structured support in place to assist him to manage that reintegration.
	
	
	Two matters of significance seem to me to be the extent and nature of the young person’s criminal record and, connected with that, the extent to which his present offending occurred whilst he was on a number of different forms of conditional liberty.
	
	
	The young person was born on 12 March 2001. He was first charged with stealing from the person on 12 July 2012. He failed to appear in Court to answer that charge on 8 October 2012 and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Only one month later he was charged with break, enter and steal and again failed to appear in Court resulting in the issue of a warrant. When he appeared in Court on 15 October 2012 he was put on a six month s 33 bond under the supervision of Juvenile Justice.
	
	
	From this point, a time line is necessary so that both the offending and the periods of conditional liberty can readily be understood.
	
	
	Between 5 May 2013 and 16 August 2014 11 of the present offences were committed. These were the break, enter and steal, the break and enter with intent, and the destroy or damage property charges.
	
	
	The young person came before the Court on 8 September 2014 charged with stealing from the person and also for being a driver never licensed on 5 June 2014. For each of those offences he was given a 12 month s 33 bond with particular conditions about living with his mother, attending school, attending counselling and non-association. On the same day he was before the Court for an aggravated break and enter in company committed on 1 August 2014. For that offence he was sentenced to 15 months’ probation under the supervision of Juvenile Justice.   He was also sentenced to 14 months’ probation for steal from the person.
	
	
	On 10 September, 17 September and 28 September 2014 he committed three further break, enter and steal offences (H58915826 sequences 1 and 2 and H 57849712 sequence 13). Those offences were committed within weeks of being placed on the bonds and probation. On 30 October 2014 he was arrested and placed in custody.
	
	
	On 18 November 2014 the young person was again before the Court on a number of charges. For one of those offences not dealt with by way of a caution, destroy or damage property, he was given a six month s 33 bond which included a condition of obeying all reasonable directions of his mother. For the offence of break and enter a dwelling house with intent he was given a s 33 bond for 12 months with a condition also to obey all reasonable directions of his mother.
	
	
	On 1 December he came before the Court partly for a call up on earlier conditional liberty and also to have new offences dealt with.    In respect of being    called up on a charge of steal from the person and a charge of aggravated break and enter with intent in company he was given a three months control order from 1 December 2014 to 28 February 2015.
	
	
	On the same day he was given a six months control order for driving a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner and for driving in a speed or manner dangerous. The control order was from 1 November 2014 to 30 April 2015. An appeal to the District Court was dismissed.
	
	
	On the same day he received a 12 month control order for break, enter and steal committed on 30 October 2014 at a time when he was on probation and the bond imposed on 8 September 2014. The 12 month control order commenced 1 November 2014 and expired 31 October 2015 with a non-parole period expiring 30 April 2015.
	
	
	On the same day he was given 12 months’ probation    under the supervision of Juvenile Justice for having goods in personal custody suspected of being stolen, and probation for two years under the supervision of Juvenile Justice for taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. Finally on that same day he was given a s 33 bond for six months for having goods in custody suspected of being stolen and for resisting an officer in the course of the officer’s duty.
	
	
	All appeals in respect of those sentences were dismissed by the District Court.
	
	
	On 15 December 2014 he was before Moree Children’s Court. This was at a time when he had been sent to live with his aunt in Brisbane but had gone to Moree to see some other members of his family. He was placed on a 12 month s 33 bond for larceny, destroy or damage property and enter enclosed lands without lawful excuse.
	
	
	On 30 April 2015 he was released to 6 months’ parole on the control order imposed on 1 December 2014. On 6 May 2015 he then committed the most serious of the offences under appeal, the aggravated break and enter (H 58712865 – sequence 1). At the time of that offence he was on the three forms of conditional liberty imposed on 8 September 2014, the two imposed on 18 November 2014, the three imposed on 1 December 2014 together with being on parole from the control order imposed on that day and on the 12 month bond imposed on 15 December 2014.
	
	
	On 9 May 2015 he was arrested and placed back in custody, bail refused. On 16 June 2015 a new bail plan was put in place. According to the report from Juvenile Justice he breached his parole on 2 July 2015 and breached all other conditions of his liberty on 20 July 2015. On 31 July 2015 he committed the offence of resisting officer in the execution of his duty whilst being on multiple forms of conditional liberty imposed on 8 September 2014, 18 November 2014, 1 December 2014 and 15 December 2014.
	
	
	It was in the light of that history that the sentence under appeal was imposed.
	
	
	Mr Wilson of counsel who appeared for the young person did not contend that no control order should have been imposed in the circumstances. His principal points were that the non-parole period imposed was too long particularly when an extended period under supervision would be necessary for the young person in his circumstances and also that the learned primary judge did not take into account the fact that the young person had spent periods of time in pre-sentence custody referable to the offences for which he was sentenced. He submitted also that the offence committed on 17 January 2012 being the first offence in the schedule at [2] above was an offence committed by the young person when he was ten years of age and was not in the circumstances an offence for which a custodial sentence would ever have been imposed. This was because of the rebuttable presumption of doli incapax and the fact that 10 was the youngest age of criminal responsibility. He submitted that it was inappropriate that such an offence should have been included in the offences in respect of which an aggregate sentence was ordered.
	
	
	A number of matters can be accepted in the young person’s favour. First, he has a significant intellectual deficit which results in problems in the area identified by Ms Hare and more particularly set out at [16]-[19] above. The relevance of that is more particularly explained by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 at [177]-[178]. Secondly, the offences were largely historical offences for which the young person was sentenced. Clear evidence of his involvement appears to have only been identified when he was fingerprinted after turning 14. The first of the offences, as noted, was committed when he was aged ten, three of them were committed when he was aged 12 and the bulk of them were committed when he was aged 13. Special principles apply in relation to young offenders and are set out in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [22]-[26] and AI v R; R v SB and AI [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [67]-[69].
	
	
	Whilst regard must be had to the young person’s youth and his intellectual and emotional difficulties the protection of the community looms large as a factor in this matter. The number of offences and the offending whilst on forms of conditional liberty leaves no alternative to incarceration. The issue is, however, whether the overall term of the control order was too long and whether the non-parole period should have been shortened regardless of the length of the overall sentence.
	
	
	I have reached the view that that neither the two year control order nor the non-parole period was appropriate in the circumstances. As to the two year period, the young person pleaded guilty to the offences. He should receive some benefit for those pleas (s 33B Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW)) although it must be said that the fingerprint evidence meant the case against him was very strong. Apart from a small reduction for those pleas I would not otherwise reduce the length of the control order because of the extent and the circumstances of the offending.
	
	
	However, the non-parole period was a very considerable increase on any sentence the young person had previously undergone. Although he was sentenced for a large number of offences, a number of them had taken place some years earlier and at a time when he had little on his record. Furthermore, account should have been taken of the period in pre-sentence custody. I accept the suggestion made by counsel for the young person that the non-parole period on the control order should be reduced to a period of 12 months.
	
	
	The young person is in need of considerable assistance to ensure that he does not again offend. That process is likely to be helped by a lengthy period under supervision. I raised that matter with counsel for the young person in the context of possibly giving a Parker warning so that some form of supervision could be put in place by the imposition of a form of conditional liberty that would extend beyond the period of the control order. If, for example, the first offence committed on 17 January 2012 did not form part of the aggregate sentence it would be open to the Court to impose a bond in relation to that matter.
	
	
	Supervision would be by Juvenile Justice but there is evidence also of assistance that can be provided from the Department of Family and Community Services.
	
	
	When the young person’s record is examined it seems to me that not only the offence committed on 17 January 2012 but also the three offences committed in May and September 2013 (H 57849712 sequences 2, 3 and 4) should not be regarded as sentences for which it was appropriate to impose a control order. It would, however, be appropriate to impose a bond in relation to those offences with the bond extending beyond the term of the control order with the condition that he be subject to the supervision of Juvenile Justice. The bond will be for a period of 2 years from today.
	
	
	The young person served two periods of pre-sentence custody. The first period from 9 May 2015 to 15 June 2015 (38 days) was solely referable to the offence of aggravated break and enter. The second period from 1 August 2015 to 14 September 2015 (45 days) was referable not only to the offences the subject of the appeal but also to his revoked parole. I consider that the control order should be backdated by 60 days (38 + (1/2 x 45 = 22)) so that it commences on 16 July 2015.
	
	
	The orders I make are:
	



	
	Extend time to appeal to 14 December 2015;
	
	
	The sentence imposed on the young person by the Children’s Court at Campbelltown on 14 September 2015 is set aside. In lieu thereof the young person is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offences H 57849712 Sequences 5 to 13, H 58915826 Sequences 1 and 2, H 58712865 Sequence 1 and H 59456116 Sequence 4 the young person is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of a control order for 1 year and 10 months commencing 16 July 2015 and expiring 15 May 2017 with a non-parole period of 12 months expiring 15 July 2016;
	
	
	For the offences H 57849712 Sequences 1 to 4 direct the young person to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 2 years. In addition to the conditions imposed by s 33(1A) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) it is a condition of the bond that the young person accept the supervision of Juvenile Justice and the supervision of any other organisation or person directed by Juvenile Justice.
	



	
	The indicative sentences for the offences included in the aggregate sentence are as follows:
	



	
	For each of the offences H 57849712 Sequences 5 to 13 and H 58915826 Sequences 1 and 2 – one year;
	
	
	For the offence H 58712865 Sequence 1 – one year three months;
	
	
	For the offence H 59456116 Sequence 4 – three months.

2701591,R v Turnbull (No. 23) [2016] NSWSC 802,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: Senior counsel for the Accused has tendered, as evidence in the defence case, MFI51, a 12-page extract from the compliance diary of Glen Turner for 2011 and 2012. Objection is taken to the tender on behalf of the Crown.
	
	
	The extract from Mr Turner's notebook contained in MFI51 relates to contact between Roger Turnbull, a son of the Accused, and Mr Turner between 7 April 2011 and 7 February 2012.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the Accused that this evidence is relevant to issues in the trial. It is said to be relevant because there was evidence from the Accused (T876-878) where the Accused stated that in conversations, to which he was party with Mr Turner, Mr Turner was allegedly critical of aspects of the conduct of Roger Turnbull.
	
	
	It is submitted for the Accused that this material in MFI51 will complete the picture by providing background or context to what is said to have occurred between Mr Turner and Roger Turnbull in 2011 and 2012. It is submitted that this material bears on the Accused's proposed reliance upon extreme provocation. It is submitted, as well, that MFI51 constitutes a business record and is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under s.69 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the material is not relevant, and if the Accused had sought to raise evidence of the interaction between Roger Turnbull and Mr Turner in 2011 and 2012, a course open was to call Roger Turnbull to give evidence. He was not called as a witness in the trial.
	
	
	The fact that the Accused may have given evidence of having some knowledge of prior contact with Roger Turnbull by Mr Turner does not render MFI51 admissible, of itself. The fact the document may constitute a business record, a proposition which was not contested by the Crown, does not render the document admissible as relevant evidence in the trial.
	
	
	It is important, in my view, that Roger Turnbull was not called as a witness in the trial.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the document MFI51 contains relevant evidence, and I decline to admit it.

		21 June 2016",2016-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701599,Kelloway v R [2016] NSWCCA 95,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: I agree with Schmidt J.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: On 5 February 2015 the applicant was convicted by a jury of a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, in an amount of 27 grams, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). Wells DCJ sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 2 years with a non-parole period of 18 months for that offence.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal that sentence on the basis that her Honour erred in overlooking the question of whether special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) had been established. Section 44 relevantly provides:
	


“44    Court to set non-parole period

(1)   Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).

(2)   The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).

(2A)    …

(2B)   …

(2C)   …

(3)    The failure of a court to comply with subsection (2), (2B) or (2C) does not invalidate the sentence.

(4)   …


	
	The Crown concedes the alleged error, it not having made any submissions to oppose the finding of special circumstances sought by the applicant. It submits, nevertheless, that the appeal would not be upheld, because the Court would conclude that no lesser sentence is warranted than that which her Honour imposed on the applicant (see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)), essentially because any non-parole period less than that imposed would not adequately reflect the criminality of the applicant’s offending. Accordingly, there was no scope for a finding of special circumstances in the sentence imposed.
	
	
	In the circumstances the applicant must be granted leave to appeal. A submission was made to her Honour as to special circumstances. It was not referred to in the sentencing remarks. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years. On sentence there had been an issue between the parties as to whether her Honour should make an intensive correction order, to which she said in her reserved judgment she had given close attention, but rejected, for reasons given. That only arose for consideration in the event that a sentence of imprisonment of not more than 2 years was imposed (s 7(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). Her Honour concluded that a custodial sentence had to be imposed, but she did not, however, deal with the question of the exercise of the s 44(2) discretion.
	
	
	Given this and the end result of the sentencing exercise, like in Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212, it must be concluded that this application, which was not in issue, was overlooked despite her Honour’s reference to matters which were relied on to support the application.
	


The sentencing judgment


	
	The applicant did not give evidence at trial, but he did give evidence on sentence, when various other evidence was led, including a presentence report, in which the applicant was assessed to be suitable for a community service order, an affidavit from his sister, a solicitor, as well as correspondence from his partner and father.
	
	
	There was no challenge to her Honour’s findings on that evidence, or to the conclusion that a custodial sentence of 2 years was warranted.
	
	
	Her Honour found that the applicant, who resided at Tweed Heads, had flown on 26 January 2014 from the Gold Coast to Sydney, where he had hired a car to drive to Wollongong, where he had bought 28 grams of methylamphetamine most of which was found in his possession on arrest in the car on 27 January. Her Honour found his evidence that he had paid $6,000 for the drugs was implausible, given its weight and purity.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted his evidence that he had not obtained the drugs with the view of supplying others, other than the acquaintance with whom he was in partnership in this venture. Despite his motivation as a user, however, she took account of the fact that it was a commercial venture designed to save the two offenders a significant amount of money and to get a better quality product for a lower price. In the result her Honour concluded that the applicant had put himself above the usual drug user/drug dealer into a position more akin to a drug courier/wholesaler, even if he was not distributing to a wider range of people. At least, her Honour held he intended to distribute a substantial quantity of high grade methylamphetamine to his friend, with a 50% cost and share agreed.
	
	
	Her Honour also took into account that the applicant was on bail for a common assault charge, of which he was not finally convicted, at the time of this offence. On his own evidence that offending involved him in knowing breach of that bail.
	
	
	Her Honour found the applicant’s subjective circumstances to be that he was aged 30 at the time of arrest; he had a minor criminal record, which included, however, a robbery in company offence while a child, at a time of a very dysfunctional period of his life. His parents had split up when he was aged 6 years and he went to live with his father, who moved to a less desirable area and began to drink and gamble. His mother failed to maintain contact with him, he changed schools and mixed with an antisocial group, drinking alcohol, abusing cannabis and committing a robbery at age 13. He then left home, was declared a ward of the State and lived in a refuge.
	
	
	By age 15, the applicant had become a single father. He has maintained parental contact with that child who lives with her mother. He now has four children. He had separated from his most previous partner, with whom he had a five year relationship and a six month old daughter, some four months before his offence. That separation led to a relapse into binge drinking and drug abuse, but he and his partner at the time of sentence intended to resume their relationship.
	
	
	The applicant had left school early, after ongoing behavioural problems, but returned of his own accord and completed his schooling to year 12. He joined the navy, working ultimately as a navigations officer until age 21. He then worked in hotel management and also obtained civil construction certificates, including a riggers and dogman qualification, work which had pursued for 5 years and was performing on arrest, albeit then he was on light duties as the result of a workplace knee injury.
	
	
	The applicant had also pursued further education in custody and was described by a teacher to be polite, conscientious and participating fully in all educational activities, including by assisting other students and working in his cell. Other references attested to his dedication to his work, improving himself, to his children and his family.
	
	
	The applicant’s drug and alcohol problems are of longstanding, including recreational methylamphetamine use on weekends for some four months before his offence. There was evidence, however, that his time in custody had had a significant impact, he did not wish to return to custody or offend again, given his recognition of the impact of what he had done. His evidence was that he was ashamed and embarrassed about his offending.
	
	
	The amount of the drugs involved in the applicant’s offending was not considered by her Honour to put his offending at the highest end of the scale, but she considered that it was more significant than that involved in the case of many other people who appear before the Court for such offending. Her Honour also considered that while this was an isolated act, it was relevant that there had been a considerable degree of premeditation.
	
	
	Her Honour accepted that the applicant was very ashamed and remorseful and had no intention of ever reoffending, despite not having entered a plea. She also accepted that he never intended to return to prison and accepted that his prospects of rehabilitation were very good, given his intelligence, that despite his difficult upbringing he had educated himself, gained excellent employment, was devoted to his children and intended to continue to support them by gainful employment, which all provided him with great incentive not to offend again.
	
	
	Her Honour considered the question of whether an intensive correction order was appropriate, but found that it was not, given his substantial drug trafficking, given the weight and purity of the drug, while on bail.
	


Is any lesser sentence warranted?


	
	Once specific error in the sentencing exercise has been established, it is the duty of the Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, exercising its independent discretion in order to determine whether the sentence is appropriate for the offender and the offence (see Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42]). On that exercise the Court must take account any evidence of relevant events which have occurred since the sentence hearing, but if the Court concludes either that the same sentence or a greater sentence, should be imposed, it is not required to resentence (see Kentwell at [43]). Affidavits of the applicant and his solicitor are relied on. They establish impressive progress in custody in fulfilment of his intention to pursue rehabilitation and not to offend again. He has available to him paid employment on his release.
	
	
	A finding of special circumstances, which permits an adjustment downwards of the non-parole period, is a discretionary finding which must rest on a conclusion that the offender’s circumstances are sufficiently special to warrant its exercise (see R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]). That requires the relevant circumstances first to be identified and then a decision to be made as to whether they justify a lowering of the non-parole period below the statutory ratio ( see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [73]; Fitzpatrick v R [2010] NSWCCA 26 at [36]). The exercise of the discretion must ensure that the non-parole period set reflects the minimum period of incarceration which the offender must serve for the offence in question, given all of the relevant circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The matters here relied on as warranting the finding of special circumstances are that this is the applicant’s first time in custody and that given the evidence of his drug abuse, he has an ongoing need for rehabilitation.
	
	
	In the presentence report, reference is made to the applicant’s reported alcohol and cannabis abuse from age 13 until the age of 25, when he progressed to amphetamine use. He reported a period of abstinence for some five years, but there had in 2012 been a conviction for possession and ice use began in December 2013, after his relationship breakdown. He was there assessed to be of low/medium risk of re-offending, given his alcohol/drug and emotional/personal problems. Relapse prevention was also identified to be necessary and a period of supervision beneficial. The applicant’s evidence on sentence supported those conclusions, given his evidence as to his long term drug abuse, the circumstances in which he came to breach his bail, by his continued drug abuse and this offence, aimed as it was at facilitating that continued abuse, after the breakdown of his relationship.
	
	
	The sentence imposed on the applicant will result in his supervision in the community if released on parole at the time that the applicant becomes eligible, for a period of six months. In all of the circumstances I have discussed, including that the applicant’s offence, while serious as her Honour found, was pursued for personal use, I consider that there should be a finding of special circumstances. Both the applicant and the community would undoubtedly benefit from him having a longer period of supervision once released from custody, than the application of the statutory ratio will result in. That conclusion must, however, be balanced with the need to ensure that he serves an appropriate minimum period of actual incarceration, which adequately reflects all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of his crime and his subjective circumstances (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628–629).
	
	
	In all of the circumstances I have discussed, I consider that the applicant should be resentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months, commencing on 5 February 2015 and expiring on 4 June 2016. The parole period of 8 months expires on 4 February 2017.
	


Orders


	
	The orders I would propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is upheld.
	
	
	The sentence is quashed.
	
	
	The appellant is resentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, commencing on 5 February 2015 and expiring on 4 February 2017, with a non-parole period of 16 months, commencing on 5 February 2015 and expiring on 4 June 2016.
	
	
	Under s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the applicant be released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period on 4 June 2016.
	
	
	The applicant’s parole be supervised and that he comply with all reasonable directions of the Department of Corrective Services relating to his ongoing treatment and counselling for substance abuse.
	



	
	WILSON J: I agree with Schmidt J.

		23 May 2016",2016-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701612,"Smith, Maltimore v R [2016] NSWCCA 93","Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant was convicted, after a trial by jury, of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine into Australia contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth), s 307.1(1). The appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years, to commence on 29 October 2013.

The appellant’s account of the circumstances in which he came to travel to Australia was that one “Reverend James Ukaegbu” had organised his trip from the United States to India. As the account went, the appellant had met with a friend of the Reverend in India, who asked the appellant to deliver some gifts to someone in Australia. These gifts included two executive golf sets, a pair of shoes, two containers of vitamins and various cakes of soap.

Upon arrival in Australia, officers from Australian Customs detected traces of methamphetamine when examining the luggage. Ultimately, 1,945.5 g of methamphetamine was found in packages secreted inside the luggage. During interviews with Australian Customs and the Australian Federal Police, the appellant recounted that he had significant misgivings about the gifts he was asked to deliver, and stressed that he had “absolutely no intent” and that he would never agree to carry drugs.

The appellant appealed against his conviction on the sole ground that the trial judge misdirected the jury with respect to the fault element of intention for the purposes of s 307.1(1). In particular, the appellant contended that the trial judge erred in her direction to the jury that they might consider whether the appellant was aware of the likelihood that the packages were in the luggage, in the sense that there was a “significant or real chance” that the packages were contained in the luggage.

The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that, for an offence contrary to s 307.1(1), it was necessary for the Crown to prove intention to import the packages and that it was not sufficient to prove that he was reckless as to whether the packages were contained within the luggage.

The Court:

(1)   The offence under the Criminal Code, s 307.1(1) of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug has three elements. [8]

Rosenfeld v R [2009] NSWCCA 74 at [23]

(2)   The first element relates to the importation of a substance, in respect of which the fault element is intention. The second element is that the substance is a border controlled drug, in respect of which the fault element is recklessness. The third element is that the quantity is a commercial quantity, in respect of which there is absolute liability. [8]

Rosenfeld v R [2009] NSWCCA 74 at [23]

(3)   The offences contained in Division 307 of the Criminal Code were designed to accord with, and be no more difficult to establish than, their Customs Act 1901 (Cth) antecedents. [25]-[26]

(4)   The observations of the High Court in Kural v R [1987] HCA 16; 162 CLR 502 as to establishing intention are applicable to the statutory meaning of ‘intention’ under the Criminal Code, s 5.2 and for the purposes of the fault element of intention under s 307.1(1). [67]-[68]

(5)   A jury may properly be directed that a finding of intention may be arrived at by a process of inferential reasoning from proved facts. [71], [82]

   He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; 157 CLR 523 at 536, 570; Kural v R [1987] HCA 16; 162 CLR 502 at [504]-[505]; Pereira v DPP (1988) 82 ALR 217 at 219-220; R v Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135 at [74]; Cao v R [2006] NSWCCA 89; 65 NSWLR 552 at [53]-[54]; Afford v The Queen; DPP (Cth) v Afford [2016] VSCA 56 at [11], [141]-[142].

(6)   However, proof of intention always involves a factual inquiry to be conducted by reference to all the circumstances of the case at hand. The question is always whether intention has been established to the satisfaction of the jury beyond reasonable doubt. [71], [83]

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant was convicted, after a trial by jury, of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine into Australia contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth), s 307.1(1), which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, 7,500 penalty units, or both. The appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 5 years, to commence on 29 October 2013.
	
	
	The appellant appealed against his conviction on the sole ground that the trial judge misdirected the jury with respect to the fault element of intention for the purposes of an offence contrary to s 307.1(1).
	


Background facts


	
	The facts not in dispute on the appeal can be briefly stated. The appellant, a citizen of the United States of America, arrived at Sydney International Airport on 29 October 2013 on a Singapore Airlines flight from India. The appellant’s luggage was examined by officers from Australian Customs and traces of methamphetamine were detected. 1,945.5 g of methamphetamine was found in packages inside items within the appellant’s luggage. The packages of methamphetamine (the packages) were not visible to the naked eye, having been secreted inside two executive golf sets, a pair of shoes, two containers of vitamins and various cakes of soap.
	
	
	The appellant was interviewed by both Australian Customs and the Australian Federal Police. The appellant’s account of the circumstances in which he came to travel to Australia was that one “Reverend James Ukaegbu” had organised his trip from the United States to India. As the account went, the appellant had met with “John”, a friend of the Reverend in India, who asked the appellant to deliver some gifts to his friend “Vernon” in Australia. The appellant recounted that he had significant misgivings about the “gifts” he was asked to deliver, and stressed that he had “absolutely no intent” and that he would never agree to carry drugs.
	
	
	The appellant’s defence at trial was that whilst he was aware the golf-sets, the shoes, the containers of vitamins and the cakes of soap were in his luggage, he did not know that there were packages concealed within them.
	


Legislation


	
	The appellant was charged with an offence under s 307.1 of the Criminal Code, which is in the following terms:
	


“307.1   Importing and exporting commercial quantities of border controlled drugs or border controlled plants

(1)   A person commits an offence if:

(a)   the person imports or exports a substance; and

(b)   the substance is a border controlled drug or border controlled plant; and

(c)   the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity.

Penalty:   Imprisonment for life or 7,500 penalty units, or both.

(2)   The fault element for paragraph (1)(b) is recklessness.

(3)   Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(c). ”


	
	The Criminal Code also provides, relevantly:
	


“5.2   Intention

(1)   A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.

(2)   A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.

(3)   A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.

5.3   Knowledge

A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events.

5.4   Recklessness

(1)   A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if:

(a)   he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and

(b)   having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.

(2)   A person is reckless with respect to a result if:

(a)   he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and

(b)   having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.

(3)   The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact.

(4)   If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.

…

5.6   Offences that do not specify fault elements

(1)   If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element.”


	
	It was accepted that s 307.1 has three elements, as was explained in Rosenfeld v R [2009] NSWCCA 74 at [23]:
	


“The first element relates to the importation of a substance for which the fault element is intention (s 5.6(1) and s 5.2 of the Code). The second element is that the substance is a border controlled drug for which the fault element is recklessness (s 307.1(2) and s 5.4 of the Code) … the third element is that the quantity is a commercial quantity. For this element there is absolute liability.”

Trial judge’s directions


	
	The trial judge, Hock DCJ, in the course of her directions to the jury, asked them to consider five questions, which were provided to them in writing, in determining whether they were satisfied of the appellant’s guilt. No complaint was made in respect of any of the five written questions. Those questions were:
	


“1   Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on about 29 October 2013 at Sydney [the appellant] imported a substance?

2   Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] intended, that is, he meant to import a substance?

3   Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the substance was a border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine?

4   Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the quantity was a commercial quantity, that is 750g or more of pure methamphetamine?

5   Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either:

a)   [the appellant] knew that the substance was a border controlled drug; or

b)   

i)   he was aware of a substantial risk that the substance was a border controlled drug; and

ii)   in the circumstances known to him, it was unjustifiable for him to take that risk.”


	
	The essential question in issue on the appeal was whether the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the element of intention for the purposes of s 307.1. The first part of her Honour’s oral directions as to the meaning of “intention” was as follows:
	


“That takes me back to Question 2. First of all, ‘Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] intended, that is, he meant to import a substance? This, as you know, is disputed by [the appellant]. This element, this second question, does not require that the Crown prove that [the appellant] knew or was even aware what was in those packages concealed in the various items, the golf sets, the orange containers and the like, but the Crown must prove that he intended to import those packages whatever they contained.”


	
	Her Honour referred to the appellant’s case that he did not intend to bring the packages into Australia and that he did not even know the packages were in the luggage. Her Honour also directed the jury that question 2, which dealt with whether the appellant intended to import the packages concealed in the luggage, was “very much related to Question 5”. Her Honour then explained to the jury the decision making process that was involved in determining whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had the requisite intention, in the following terms:
	


“Has the Crown proved to you that [the appellant] knew or believed that there were those extra packages in the items, the golf sets et cetera, which he admits he imported? If so, you then go on to consider whether [the appellant] intended to import these packages that are the subject of the charge.”


	
	Her Honour continued:
	


“When you are looking at the question of what [the appellant] intended and when looking at what he knew or believed about the contents of his luggage the question is what did [the appellant] know, what did [the appellant] believe, what did [the appellant] intend, not what a hypothetical person in his position would have known or intended. In other words, it is the state of mind of [the appellant, this appellant], which is relevant.”


	
	No part of these directions was challenged, but the importance of setting them out is to provide the context in which the direction the subject of challenge was given. The passage that was the subject of challenge was as follows:
	


“When you are considering whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] intended to import the substance … you might also consider whether he was aware of the likelihood that those packages were in the items in his suitcase … in the sense that he recognised there was a significant or real chance that the orange containers the soaps, the golf sets, contained those extra packages in which the substance was located.

If you find that he had that state of mind you would go on to consider whether that was sufficient to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt he intended to import the extra packages which contained the substance in the sense that he meant that those packages would be imported.”


	
	During the course of their deliberations, the jury sought clarification in respect of question 5(b)(i) and (ii). Question 5 related to the physical element of the offence, that the substance was a border controlled drug, in respect of which recklessness was a sufficient mental element: see s 307.1(2). Her Honour gave the following written directions to the jury in respect of those questions. As to questions 5(a) and (b)(i), her Honour stated:
	


“It is for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] was aware of a substantial risk, that is a real risk or a risk of substance, in the sense that he had a conscious awareness of a substantial risk that the substance was a border controlled drug.

-   A risk that is without substance or which is fanciful or speculative is not a substantial risk.

-   Risk means possibility, chance or likelihood.”


	
	As to question 5(b)(ii), her Honour stated:
	


“If you found that [the appellant] was aware of a substantial risk that the substance was a border controlled drug there is no suggestion that there was justification for him to take that risk.

The issue of justification simply does not arise in this trial.”

Appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant submitted, correctly, that it was necessary for the Crown to prove intention to import the packages and that it was not sufficient to prove that he was reckless as to whether the packages were contained within the luggage. The appellant submitted, therefore, again correctly, that the critical question for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was aware, when he arrived in Australia, that there were packages secreted in the luggage and that directions to that effect were required.
	
	
	The appellant submitted, however, that the effect of the impugned passage in her Honour’s summing up set out above at [13] was that the jury were directed that they should consider whether the appellant recognised that there was a real chance that the concealed packages were present in the luggage and that, if he did, that state of mind could be sufficient to establish an intention to import those packages. The appellant contended that a direction to that effect was erroneous. Rather, as the appellant’s argument went, the jury should have been directed that to be guilty of the offence charged, the appellant had to know or believe that there were concealed packages in the luggage.
	
	
	The appellant accepted that if the jury were satisfied that he knew that the luggage contained the packages, it was inevitable that he either knew the substances contained in the packages were drugs or realised that there was a significant risk that they were drugs, so that the third element of the offence, for which recklessness was sufficient, would be made out. In this regard, the appellant made no complaint as to her Honour’s directions in respect of question 5, nor in respect of her written directions to the jury when they sought clarification regarding the meaning of questions 5(b)(i) and (ii). Further, the appellant acknowledged that the jury had been told, correctly, that the requirement of lack of justification raised in question 5 was not in dispute.
	
	
	However, the appellant submitted that for the jury to even reach the stage where they were required to consider question 5, they would already have had to determine that the appellant intended to import the concealed packages. The appellant submitted that it was significant that the jury sought clarification of question 5(b) and not question 2. The appellant argued that the jury may well have understood the trial judge’s direction, set out at [13], to mean that, in determining whether he had the requisite intention for the purposes of s 307.1(1)(a), he only needed to be aware of a real chance that concealed packages were present in the luggage. In other words, according to the appellant’s argument, the jury, having regard to the terms of the impugned direction, may have readily decided that there was a real chance that there were concealed packages in the luggage and thus moved to a consideration of whether he knew or was aware of a substantial risk the packages contained a border controlled drug. He submitted that this would explain why the jury sought clarification of questions 5(b)(i) and (ii), but raised no query in relation to question 2.
	
	
	In support of the contention that the impugned direction was erroneous, the appellant placed reliance on Fang v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 254, where this Court considered a direction in which the trial judge had also used the language of “significant or real chance”.
	
	
	During the course of argument on the appeal, a question arose as to whether the statements of the High Court in Kural v R [1987] HCA 16; 162 CLR 502, at 505, concerning the meaning of intention for the purposes of mens rea at common law, applied to the statutory test of intention in s 5.2. In his additional written submissions filed with the leave of the Court, the appellant submitted that the statement in Kural, at 505, that:
	


“… the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved [the criminal act] and nevertheless persisted in that conduct”

should not be adopted in respect of the meaning of “intention” for the purposes of s 5.2 of the Criminal Code.


	
	The appellant supported his submission that Kural ought not apply by reference to the definitions in the Criminal Code of “knowledge”: s 5.3 and “recklessness”: s 5.4. The appellant especially drew attention to s 5.4(4), set out above at [7], noting that the converse is not true, and that where intention is the fault element, recklessness will not suffice: see Fang at [72]. The appellant also referred the Court to various authorities where intention was an element of the relevant offence, and to the recent High Court decision of Zaburoni v The Queen [2016] HCA 12.
	


Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that her Honour’s reference to “significant or real chance” was not erroneous. In doing so, the Crown withdrew a concession which it had made both in writing and orally that her Honour’s reference to “significant or real chance” was erroneous. However, the Crown’s position had always been that, viewed in context, her Honour’s directions nevertheless correctly informed the jury as to what was required to prove intention. The Crown also denied that the trial judge had made an error of the kind that was considered in Fang.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that it was necessary for the jury to be directed that they could not find that the appellant intended to import the substance in the concealed packages unless he knew or believed that the concealed packages were present in his luggage. However, the Crown submitted that the jury were correctly directed in this regard when her Honour directed them in the terms set out above at [12], although acknowledging that this part of her Honour’s directions was directed to the fact that it was the appellant’s knowledge which was relevant rather than that of some hypothetical person. The Crown pointed to her Honour’s language in this passage which, it submitted, made it clear that when considering question 2, the jury was concerned with what the appellant knew or believed, not whether there was “a real chance that concealed packages were present in his luggage” as was contended by the appellant. The Crown further submitted that her Honour had stressed the proper consideration for the jury in her direction that “the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that [the appellant] intended to import the substance”.
	


The authorities: does the Kural line of authority apply to the meaning of intention for the purposes of an offence under s 307.1?


	
	In He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; 157 CLR 523, the High Court held that the application of common law principles of criminal responsibility to the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) offences of importing or possessing prohibited goods contrary to ss 233B(1)(b) and (c) respectively required proof of mens rea in the sense of guilty knowledge: see Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason J agreed, at 537, Brennan J at 584 and Dawson J at 596. Guilty knowledge required proof of intention. In 2005, the Customs Act offences were replaced by offences under the Criminal Code, relevantly in this case, of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug contrary to the provisions of s 307.1: see Explanatory Memorandum to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005. The Explanatory Memorandum states that:
	


“The proposed Division 307 offences have been designed to accord as closely as possible to the offences they are replacing in the Customs Act. A guiding principle has been to ensure that the offences in proposed Division 307 are no more difficult to prove than the existing offences in the Customs Act.”


	
	It is convenient, therefore, in determining the question in issue here, namely, whether the trial judge misdirected the jury in respect of the element of intention under the Criminal Code, to commence with the meaning given by the High Court in He Kaw Teh to the element of knowledge in the Customs Act offences under s 233B(1) of importing and possessing a prohibited substance.
	
	
	In He Kaw Teh Gibbs CJ, at 536, observed that a jury “may well be satisfied” that an accused person had the requisite knowledge if the person “wilfully shut his eyes to the probability” that he was importing or had possession of prohibited goods. Brennan J, at 570, considered that
	


“… some state of mind less than knowledge is [not] sufficient to establish intent. Actual knowledge is required but what is generally required to be known is at least the likelihood that the prescribed result of an act will occur…” (emphasis added, citations omitted)


	
	His Honour continued, at 585:
	


“The exigencies of international trade and intercourse strengthen the inference that the Parliament intended that a supposed offender should not be criminally responsible unless he intended to import narcotic goods. That requirement casts on the prosecution the onus of proving, when the narcotic goods are imported in a container, that the supposed offender knew, at the time when he imported the container, that it contained or was likely to contain narcotic goods, or that it contained or was likely to contain an object that was or was likely to be narcotic goods.” (emphasis added)


	
	He Kaw Teh was considered by the court in Kural. The plurality, Mason, Deane and Dawson JJ, citing He Kaw Teh, stated, at 504, that the prosecution was required to prove that a person accused of an offence under s 233B of the Customs Act acted with mens rea, that is, with a guilty mind. Their Honours observed, however, that as there was a difference in the majority decisions in He Kaw Teh as to what, in the ordinary case, was necessary for the prosecution to discharge its onus of proving mens rea, it was desirable “to indicate ... what will at least in the ordinary case of a prosecution for such an offence be necessary to discharge [the] onus” of proving that the person acted with mens rea, that is, with a guilty mind.
	
	
	Their Honours stated at 504-505:
	


Because the mental elements in different crimes vary widely it is impossible to make a statement which is universally valid for all purposes about the essential elements of a guilty mind. Depending upon the nature of the particular offence the requirement of a guilty mind may involve intention, foresight, knowledge or awareness with respect to some act, circumstance or consequence. Where the offence charged is the commission of a proscribed act, a guilty mind exists when an intention on the part of the accused to do the proscribed act is shown. The problem then is one of proof. How does one prove the existence of the requisite intention? Sometimes there is direct evidence in the form of an admission by the accused that he intended his conduct to involve the forbidden act. More often, the existence of the requisite intention is a matter of inference from what the accused has actually done. The intention may be inferred from the doing of the proscribed act and the circumstances in which it was done.

Where, as here, it is necessary to show an intention on the part of the accused to import a narcotic drug, that intent is established if the accused knew or was aware that an article which he intentionally brought into Australia comprised or contained narcotic drugs. But that is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained narcotic drugs would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and nevertheless persisted in that conduct.” (emphasis added)


	
	Their Honours continued that, at a practical level, any inference of a guilty mind would ordinarily be irresistible if the accused person:
	


“… was aware, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in what he was importing and of the likelihood that it was a narcotic drug.”


	
	Their Honours stressed that their comments did not constitute a statement of principle. Rather, intention being a question of fact, “in most cases the outcome would depend on an inference to be drawn from primary facts found by the tribunal of fact”. Although dissenting as to the outcome, in particular, the application of the proviso, Toohey and Gaudron JJ were of the same view: see at 512.
	
	
	These observations in Kural were applied in Saad v R [1987] HCA 14; 70 ALR 667 and Pereira v DPP [1988] HCA 57; 82 ALR 217.
	
	
	In Pereira, where the Court was concerned, inter alia, with “wilful blindness”, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated, at 219-220:
	


“In Kural v R it was emphasised that in this area it is important not to transform matters of fact into propositions of law. That case was concerned not with what constituted ‘knowledge’ as a distinct element of an offence but with the unspecified requirement that the accused had acted with mens rea or a guilty mind. It was pointed out in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ that, depending upon the nature of the particular offence, ‘the requirement of a guilty mind may involve intention, foresight, knowledge or awareness with respect to some act, circumstance or consequence’. Their Honours concluded that actual knowledge or awareness of the presence of the particular substance was not an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence involved in that case, namely, the offence of importing a prohibited import.

Even where, as with the present charges, actual knowledge is either a specified element of the offence charged or a necessary element of the guilty mind required for the offence, it may be established as a matter of inference from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence. However, three matters should be noted. First, in such cases the question remains one of actual knowledge. It is never the case that something less than knowledge may be treated as satisfying a requirement of actual knowledge. Secondly, the question is that of the knowledge of the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused, although, of course, that may not be an irrelevant consideration. Finally, where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available. All that having been said, the fact remains that a combination of suspicious circumstances and failure to make inquiry may sustain an inference of knowledge of the actual or likely existence of the relevant matter. In a case where a jury is invited to draw such an inference, a failure to make inquiry may sometimes, as a matter of lawyer's shorthand, be referred to as wilful blindness. Where that expression is used, care should be taken to ensure that a jury is not distracted by it from a consideration of the matter in issue as a matter of fact to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.” (citations omitted)


	
	The introduction of the Criminal Code Act in 1997 codified the general principles of criminal law with respect to offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, including those offences under the Customs Act which were in issue in He Kaw Teh and Kural: see s 2.1. Under the Code, the fault element of an offence may require “intention”, “knowledge”, “recklessness” or “negligence”: s 5.1.
	
	
	The requisite fault element for the offence of importing a prohibited substance contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act, having regard to the codified principles of criminal responsibility under the Code, was considered by this Court in R v Narongchai Saengsai-Or [2004] NSWCCA 108; 61 NSWLR 135. Bell J, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed, observed, at [37], that under the Criminal Code, the common law concepts of actus rea and mens rea had been replaced by proof of the physical and fault elements of the offence and that the fault element for an offence contrary to s 233B was intention. The statutory route to that conclusion is not relevant to the question in issue in this case. What is relevant is the Court’s analysis of the meaning of ‘intention’ under the Code.
	
	
	Bell J, at [66], referred to Brennan J’s statement in He Kaw Teh and, at [67], cited the emphasised passage of Kural set out above at [30]. Her Honour continued, at [69]:
	


“The distinction between proof that an accused person intended to import narcotic goods and proof that he or she was reckless as to the circumstance that the thing imported contained narcotic goods is to my mind a real one. The joint judgment in Kural contains discussion of how the Crown might prove the existence of the intention to import the prohibited imports by a process of inferential reasoning. The inquiry remains one of proof of intention. Their Honours emphasised that their comments were not designed as a direction to be given to juries but rather as guidance for trial judges in formulating directions appropriate to a given case to assist the jury in determining this factual question.”


	
	Her Honour reiterated, at [74], that:
	


“It is appropriate for a judge in directing a jury on proof of intention under the Criminal Code to provide assistance as to how (in the absence of an admission) the Crown may establish intention by inferential reasoning in the same way as intention may be proved at common law. Intention to import narcotic goods into Australia may be the inference to be drawn from circumstances that include the person’s awareness of the likelihood that the thing imported contained narcotic goods.”


	
	In Cao v R [2006] NSWCCA 89; 65 NSWLR 552, this Court was concerned with an offence under s 233B of the Customs Act of possessing prohibited goods in respect of which the fault element was also intention as defined by the Criminal Code, s 5.2. Howie J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Barr J agreed, held that the principles stated in Kural and the cases that had applied it, were applicable notwithstanding that the prosecution was one to which the Criminal Code applied. As his Honour observed:
	


“53   [Those cases] simply set out a process of reasoning that the jury might follow in order to find the mental, or fault, element of the offence proved. That process of reasoning seems to me to be as applicable to proof of intention under the Code as to proof of intention under the Common Law. I have already pointed out that this Court in Saengsai-Or accepted that this line of authority was applicable to an offence of importation to which the Code applied. There is no reason in logic or law, that I can see, why it should not also apply to a case of possession or attempted possession of imported goods.

54   The fact that the Code defines recklessness in terms of a circumstance as ‘an awareness of a substantial risk that the circumstance will exist’ is not to the point. As was acknowledged in Saengsai-Or, proof of intention is more difficult for the prosecution than proof of recklessness. In a case where there is some other inference open from a finding of a belief in the likelihood of drugs being present other than that the accused intended to possess the drugs, the Crown will have to negative that inference beyond reasonable doubt before the jury can convict the accused. The fact that in the usual case there will be no other inference available, does not mean that the process of reasoning should not apply under the Code simply because it may have some superficial similarity to how the Code defines recklessness.”


	
	In Rosenfeld, the jury had been directed in respect of the fault elements of the offence under s 307.1, namely, intention to import a substance; recklessness as to whether the substance imported was a border controlled drug; and the quantity of the drug. The trial judge’s directions as to intention included the following impugned passages:
	


… the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused intended to bring into Australia the substance. They do not have to prove that he knew the substance was ecstasy. They have to prove however that he knew or was aware or it was likely that there was a prohibited substance in the tank and that he, the accused, intended to bring that prohibited substance into Australia. So that is the first matter that the Crown must prove. That is an essential element that he must prove.”


	
	Later the jury was directed:
	


“The Crown has to prove the case but the real matter, the ultimate question, is whether or not the accused did intend or was aware of the substantial risk, and has the Crown proved those matters beyond reasonable doubt. That is the ultimate question and the ultimate question for your determination.”


	
	The trial judge further directed the jury that “the ultimate questions” were:
	


“… whether … he intended or meant to bring into Australia a substance which he knew or believed was likely to be a prohibited substance, or whether or not the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt he was reckless and that he was aware of a real risk of substance that there was a prohibited substance in the tanks and being so aware, was he justified in bringing it in.”


	
	The complaint on the appeal in Rosenfeld was that the second part of the direction may have confused the jury by introducing the issue of recklessness in circumstances where the trial had been contested upon the element of intention. Complaint was also made that the third part of these directions reinforced that confusion.
	
	
	This Court (McClellan CJ at CL, James and Buddin JJ agreeing) considered that the direction in the passage set out at [42] above was potentially confusing, but that in the context of the totality of the directions given, the jury was appropriately directed in the matter.
	
	
	Fang concerned directions given to the jury in respect of the elements of the offence charged in that case, namely, s 307.5, which is structured in similar terms to s 307.1. The Crown was required to prove that the accused had intentionally possessed a substance (equivalent to the requirement in s 307.1(1)(a)) and had been reckless as to whether the substance was a border controlled drug (equivalent to the requirement in s 307.1(1)(b)).
	
	
	The trial judge in Fang gave the following directions to the jury:
	


“… the dispute at the heart of this trial which the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused possessed the drugs in the five boxes. Members of the jury, in considering that, you must examine and consider carefully whether the accused was aware of the likelihood that there was a significant or real chance that the drugs were narcotic drugs, or whether the accused was reckless as to whether the five boxes contained prohibited drugs. 

…

There are a number of pieces of evidence in the case on which the Crown relies and from which the Crown asks that you draw the conclusion that the accused was aware of the likelihood that there was a significant or real chance there were prohibited drugs in the five boxes or whether he was reckless as to whether the five boxes contained prohibited drugs.

…

You must consider all the pieces of evidence on which the Crown relies and decide what facts are proved by that evidence and then, in light of all the evidence in the case, ask yourselves whether that combination of facts satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable conclusion is that the accused knew that there were drugs in the boxes.

…

As I said, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was reckless as to whether there were drugs in the five boxes. That is something you are asked to conclude from the evidence in the case.”


	
	This Court (Hodgson JA, Price and Fullerton JJ agreeing), in response to the challenge that there should have been no reference to a “significant or real chance”, stated:
	


“71.   Although the third of those extracts referred to a conclusion that the appellant ‘knew that there were drugs in the boxes’, the cumulative effect of these directions was in my opinion to leave the jury with the impression that it was sufficient that the Crown prove the appellant was reckless as to whether or not drugs were there, thereby conflating the two fault elements from pars (a) and (c) and conveying to the jury that recklessness was sufficient for them.

72   What the summing up should have conveyed was that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to possess the substance in the boxes (that is, the substance that turned out to be methamphetamine), and that he was guilty of recklessness as to whether this substance was a border-controlled drug: cf Rosenfeld v R [2009] NSWCCA 74 at [34] – [40]. Proof of intention to possess a substance required proof of an intention directed to the possession of the substance (that is, proof that the appellant meant to possess it). This is not the same as recklessness or even knowledge; although in my opinion one could not intend, in possessing a box, to possess a substance contained within the box, unless one had a belief that there was such a substance in it.”


	
	In the recent decision of Afford v The Queen; DPP (Cth) v Afford [2016] VSCA 56 the Victorian Court of Appeal considered whether a jury direction as to the meaning of intention in s 307, which made reference to a belief “in the likelihood of importation of the substance”, was erroneous. The majority, Priest and Beach JJA, expressed the view, at [130], that Saengsai-Or and Cao were not directly on point. It will be necessary to return to that observation. It is convenient first to consider their Honours’ conclusion that the jury direction was flawed.
	
	
	The trial judge in Afford had directed that the reference to “likelihood” in the phrase quoted meant a “real or significant chance”, but that “a mere suspicion falling short of the required belief or awareness … is not sufficient to prove guilt”. The jury had also been given a checklist of the elements of the offence. That list stated, in respect of the element of intention, that the accused had to have a “belief” in the “likelihood of the importation of the substance. ‘Likelihood’ here means a real or significant chance”: see Afford at [122] (emphasis added).
	
	
	Priest and Beach JJA held, at [143], that the trial judge’s direction suffered from “two deficiencies”:
	


“First, the charge may have left the jury with the impression that the establishment of an awareness of a likelihood that the substance was being imported was the equivalent of establishing the intention required under the Code. Secondly, we think that the judge did not make clear that any such awareness could only be part of the circumstances from which a relevant inference of intention might be capable of being drawn, and was in any event no more than a path of reasoning which the jury could follow or not follow as it saw fit.” (emphasis added)


	
	In arriving at that conclusion, their Honours stated that the reasoning in Kural was not directly applicable to a charge under s 307.1. Their Honours made the following observations:
	


“137   In Kural, the plurality said that the inference of mens rea would ordinarily be irresistible in cases involving the importation of a narcotic drug if it was proved:

(a)   the accused actually imported the drug;

(b)   the accused was aware at the time of the alleged commission of the offence of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in what he was importing; and

(c)   the accused was aware of the likelihood that the substance in question in what he was importing was a narcotic drug.

138   The Crown seeks to rewrite that proposition in the present case so as to contend that an inference of an intention to import a substance will ordinarily be irresistible in cases where it is proved that:

(a)   the accused actually imported the substance; and

(b)   the accused was aware at the time of the alleged commission of the offence of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in what he was importing.

139   This translation is not easily made. It is one thing to say that an accused with an awareness of a likelihood of the presence of narcotic drugs, who nevertheless imports into Australia, might be thought to have an intention to import those narcotic drugs, the consequences of such an importation being very serious. It is another to apply this sort of reasoning to every product or substance no matter how innocuous, or lacking in consequences its importation might be. One cannot simply carve up the words of the plurality in Kural by excising those parts which are not relevant to a particular element of a Code offence, to arrive at a result that expresses a far more general conclusion than that which was expressed in Kural. Whether the reasoning in Kural can be made to apply to substances other than narcotic substances in cases where the fault element associated with importation is intention but where the fault element as to ‘border-controlled’ is recklessness is likely to depend (at least) on the type of substance about which the accused has a relevant awareness.” (emphasis added, citations omitted)


	
	Their Honours also observed that the plurality in Kural had expressly eschewed any suggestion that proof of intention in the context of a belief in a “likelihood” gives rise to a substantive principle of law: at [140]. Their Honours, at [141], considered that the reasoning in Kural, which, as they pointed out, was in the context of an intention to import a narcotic substance, was not easily translatable into cases where the prosecution is required to prove intention to import a substance. Their Honours emphasised that whether the accused person had the requisite intention was a question of fact and, in the absence of an admission, the intention of the accused fell to be inferred from the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	Their Honours, at [141], also accepted that an inference of intention might be drawn from all the circumstances of the case, including a person’s awareness of the likelihood that the substance would be imported. However, their Honours expressed the view that it could not be said, “without more”, that:
	


“… in all cases, involving any conceivable type of substance, a jury could infer to the requisite standard an intention to import a substance from an awareness of the likelihood of the presence of the substance alone.”


	
	Their Honours continued, at [142]:
	


“While it may be permissible for a trial judge to direct a jury in some cases that one circumstance that could be taken into account (together with all of the evidence) to infer an intention to import a substance was an established awareness by the applicant of the likelihood that the substance was being imported, it should always be made clear to the jury that such an approach is no more than a path of reasoning that a jury could (but are not required to) engage in as part of its consideration of the intention issue.”


	
	Maxwell P, in his dissenting judgment, at [11], considered that the Kural formulation was applicable to proof of intention under the Code, including in respect of the fault element of the offence under s 307.1. In addition to the authorities referred to above, the President, at [38], referred to Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 1 of 2004 [2005] VSCA 172; 12 VR 299, to which this Court had referred in Cao. In that case, in relation to State drug trafficking offences, the Court had accepted that “knowledge of a significant or real chance” would support an inference of intention under the relevant Victorian legislation, but stated that a jury should not be directed that “knowledge of a significant or real chance” was sufficient to convict. Rather, it was to be made clear to the jury that it was for them to decide whether an inference of intention should be drawn and that “awareness of a significant or real chance” was “capable of sustaining an inference of intention”.
	


Other authorities


	
	The appellant, both in the written submissions filed before the appeal and in further submissions filed with leave after the hearing of the appeal, drew the Court’s attention to a number of other decisions which he contended supported his case that the trial judge’s directions to the jury were erroneous and that it was not sufficient, for the purposes of establishing intention, for the jury to find there was an awareness of a significant or real chance that the packages were in the luggage.
	
	
	The appellant pointed out, inter alia, that in Fang it had been held that recklessness cannot satisfy the fault element of intention. That proposition is not contentious. The appellant also referred to R v Tang [2008] HCA 39; 237 CLR 1; the High Court decisions of He Kaw Teh and Pereiera; R v Verde [2009] VSCA 16; 193 A Crim R 211; R v Willmot (No 2) [1985] 2 Qd R 413; R v Reid [2006] QCA 202; [2007] 1 Qd R 64; R v Ping [2005] QCA 472; [2006] 2 Qd R 69, which were all criminal cases where intention was an element of the offence; and R v Jogee; Ruddock v The Queen [2016] UKSC 8, in which the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom reconsidered the law of accessorial liability for criminal acts.
	
	
	The decisions of Willmot (No 2); Reid;  and Ping were recently considered by the High Court in Zaburoni, which concerned the meaning of intention for the purposes of the offence under the Criminal Code (Qld), s 317(b), of unlawfully transmitting a serious disease to another with intent to do so, proof of actual intent being an element of the offence.
	
	
	The plurality in Zaburoni, Keifel, Bell and Keane JJ, referred, at [8]-[10], to the tension between the statement of Connolly J in Willmot that:
	


“The ordinary and natural meaning of the word ‘intends’ is to mean, to have in mind. Relevant definitions in The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary show that what is involved is the directing of the mind, having a purpose or design”

and his Honour’s later observation, that:

“… if there was direct evidence of the accused’s awareness of death or grievous bodily harm as the probable result of his act, the jury might properly be directed that, if they accepted that evidence, it was open to infer from it that the accused intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm as the case may be.”


	
	The plurality pointed out, at [10], that
	


“To engage in conduct knowing that it will probably produce a particular harm is reckless. It is evidence which, taken with other evidence, may support a conclusion that the person intended to produce that harm. Nonetheless, foresight of risk of harm is distinct in law from the intention to produce that harm.”


	
	Their Honours also considered the statements made by the Court in Reid and observed, at [13], that:
	


“Keane JA (as his Honour then was) disavowed that common law concepts of foreseeability, likelihood and probability were relevant to proof of the element of intention for the offence created by s 317(b). That statement should be accepted.” (footnote omitted)


	
	Rather, as their Honours stated at [14], where intent was an element of liability for an offence under the Criminal Code (Qld):
	


“… the prosecution is required to establish that the accused meant to produce that result by his or her conduct”

and:

“… knowledge or foresight of result, whether possible, probable or certain, is not a substitute in law for proof of a specific intent under the Code.”


	
	However, their Honours distinguished what is necessary to prove intention under the Criminal Code (Qld) from the meaning of intention under the Criminal Code (Cth), s 5.2, noting, at [14], that the Commonwealth Code, by s 5.2(3):
	


“... allows that a person has intention with respect to a result if the person is aware that the result will occur in the ordinary course of events.”


	
	The plurality, at [41], acknowledged that the accused had an awareness of the risk of transmitting HIV to the complainant. However, as their Honours made clear at [42]:
	


“… a person’s awareness of the risk that his or her conduct may result in harm does not, without more, support the inference that the person intended to produce that harm.”

Decision


	
	A question arises at the outset as to whether this Court is required to apply the reasoning of the plurality in Afford unless we consider it to be plainly wrong: Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; 230 CLR 89. In deciding that question, the following considerations arise: whether we consider that the reasoning of this Court in Saengsai-Or and Cao should be followed in this matter; whether the High Court’s reasoning in Zaburoni effectively disapproves or otherwise qualifies those two decisions; whether the fact that the majority in Afford distinguished Saengsai-Or and Cao leaves this Court free from the constraints of Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd even if we were not convinced that the majority in Afford were plainly wrong; and finally, if necessary, whether we consider that Afford is plainly wrong. 
	
	
	The questions posed in the preceding paragraph are necessarily predicated upon the trial judge’s directions to the jury in this case being relevantly similar to the directions in Afford. As we explain, we do not consider that to be the case. However, as the majority in Afford have expressly put to one side the statements in Saengsai-Or and Cao, it is appropriate for this Court to indicate that we consider that we should follow and apply the reasoning in Saengsai-Or and Cao in this case. Our reasoning in this regard is influenced by the similarity of the conduct in those cases, and by the fact that those decisions were not found to be plainly wrong by the Court in Afford.
	
	
	Saengsai-Or and Cao were each concerned with the meaning of intention under s 5.2 as applicable to an offence under the Customs Act, s 233B(1). Saengsai-Or involved an importation charge and Cao involved a possession charge under the Customs Act: s 233B(1)(b) and (c) respectively. Those provisions required proof of importation or possession, as appropriate to the relevant offence, as well as proof of intention to import or possess narcotic goods, again, as appropriate. It was in respect of the intention element that this Court held, in each, that the High Court’s statements in Kural as to proof of intention were applicable to the statutory meaning of intention under s 5.2.
	
	
	In our opinion, the distinction introduced by the Criminal Code, which requires intention to import the substance and recklessness as to whether the substance was, as in this case, a border controlled drug, as opposed to the position under the Customs Act offences, does not make the statements of the High Court in Kural inapplicable. What was required under the Customs Act and what is still required under the Criminal Code is proof that the person meant to engage in the relevant conduct. The relevant conduct for the purposes of s 307.1 of the Criminal Code is importation of a substance. The required fault element is that the person meant to import that substance. The nature of the substance is a separate element of the offence under s 307.1, for which the fault element is recklessness. Under the Customs Act the relevant conduct was, relevantly, importation of a prohibited substance and the required fault element was that the person meant to import a prohibited substance.
	
	
	The fact that the elements which were conflated under the Customs Act were separated under the Criminal Code did not bring about any change in content of the mental element(s) required to be proved by the Crown. We have earlier (at [25]) referred to the Explanatory Memorandum in which it was indicated that the Code offences were designed to accord as closely as possible with the offences in the Customs Act they replaced.
	
	
	Accordingly, had we considered it necessary for the determination of this matter, we would indicate we do not agree with the distinction drawn by the majority in Afford at [139], at least insofar as prohibited substances are concerned. This may mean that there is a difference in approach between this Court and the Victorian Court of Appeal on this issue, although, having regard to their Honour’s further observations at [141], the difference may not be significant, particularly in a case such as this.
	
	
	We should state, however, that we agree with the majority’s statements at [141] and [143], that proof of intention involves a factual finding and that a jury may properly be directed that a finding of intention may be arrived at by a process of inferential reasoning from proved facts. In our opinion, this case is exactly the kind of case envisaged by the Victorian Court of Appeal in their comments at [142].
	
	
	Nor do we consider that the recent decision of Zaburoni relevantly touches upon the statutory meaning of intention under the Criminal Code (Cth), s 5.2(1) which deals with proof of intention with respect to conduct. Zaburoni was concerned with the meaning of proof of intention to produce a particular result under the Criminal Code (Qld). However, as is apparent from the reasoning of the plurality at [41]-[42], their Honours accepted that awareness or foresight of the risk of sexual transmission of disease might lay a foundation for an inference of intention, but that awareness of the risk, without more, was not sufficient to support such an inference.
	


Was the direction to the jury wrong?


	
	It is thus necessary to consider her Honour’s directions to determine whether the directions she gave informed the jury of a permissible process of reasoning, or whether the directions were likely to have left the jury with the understanding that it was sufficient to find that intention was made out if they were satisfied there was a “significant or real chance” that the items of luggage contained the packages that were secreted in them.
	
	
	An analysis of her Honour’s directions reveals that the jury were given the following directions in respect of question 2, as to whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended, that is, meant, to import a substance. Relevantly, her Honour first stated that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant knew or was even aware what was in the concealed packages. Rather, the Crown was required to prove that the appellant intended to import the packages whatever they contained. This is a correct statement of the required intention for the purposes of s 307.1 and was not challenged by the appellant.
	
	
	Her Honour next reminded the jury that the Crown case was that the appellant intended to import the concealed packages in the sense that he meant to bring them into Australia. Her Honour then referred to the appellant’s case that he did not intend to bring the packages into Australia and that he did not even know the packages were in the luggage.
	
	
	Her Honour next stated that the issue of whether the appellant meant to bring the secreted passages into Australia was “very much related to Question 5” and her Honour stated that it might be helpful to start by looking at what the appellant knew or believed about the contents of the luggage. No challenge was made to that statement.
	
	
	Her Honour then stated that if the Crown had proved that the appellant knew or believed that there were the extra packages in the luggage they were to go on to consider whether the appellant “intended to import these packages that are the subject of the charge”. This aspect of her Honour’s directions is subject to challenge.
	
	
	Her Honour next stressed that when considering what the appellant intended and what he knew or believed about the contents of the luggage, the question to be decided was the state of mind of the appellant, not what some hypothetical person in the appellant’s position would have known or intended. There was no challenge to this part of the directions.
	
	
	Her Honour next indicated to the jury a suggested line of reasoning in determining whether the appellant intended to import the packages secreted in the luggage. The jury was told they “might also consider whether [the appellant] was aware of the likelihood that those packages were in his [luggage]”, as her Honour explained, “in the sense that he recognised there was a significant or real chance” that the luggage contained the secreted packages (emphasis added).
	
	
	However, and importantly, her Honour next directed the jury that if they found that the appellant “had that state of mind”, they would still need to:
	


“… go on to consider whether that was sufficient to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt he intended to import the extra packages which contained the substance in the sense that he meant those packages would be imported.”


	
	These directions are to be contrasted with the directions given in Afford.  Although the trial judge in that case included a direction in terms of whether the accused person “believed in the likelihood of importation of the substance and by likelihood I mean a real or significant chance”, his Honour also directed the jury that “intention” did not only rest on actual knowledge but could be established if they were
	


“… satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused believed that the suitcase believed the substance [sic.], … that would sustain an inference as to intention. So also if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of a real and significant chance that his conduct involved the importation of the substance and he nevertheless persisted with that conduct. That would suffice to infer an intention to import.”


	
	This direction was significantly different from the direction given by the trial judge in this case. We do not consider that her Honour’s directions contained the deficiencies that were found in the jury directions in Afford and in particular, the second ‘flaw’ identified by the majority in Afford at [143] set out above at [50]: see emphasised portion of that paragraph. Rather, as the majority pointed out in Afford, it is permissible in a given case for a jury to draw an inference of the relevant intention from all the circumstances of the case, including a person’s awareness of the likelihood that something was being imported, other than, as was the case here, the visible items of luggage.
	
	
	Her Honour’s directions informed the jury that that process of reasoning was available to them. This is explicit in her direction that when considering whether the appellant had the requisite intention they “might also consider” whether he had an awareness of a likelihood of secreted packages in the luggage. Importantly, her Honour’s direction did not conclude at that point. The jury were then specifically directed that if they were satisfied of that state of mind, that is, the awareness of that likelihood, they still had to determine whether that satisfied them, to the requisite standard, that the appellant had the relevant intention, that is, that he meant to import those packages.
	
	
	In our opinion, there was no error in her Honour’s direction to the jury. Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.
	


The proviso


	
	We should, however, make brief reference to the submission advanced by the Crown that if the Court concluded there had been a misdirection, there was nonetheless neither a substantial wrong nor a miscarriage of justice so as to warrant quashing the conviction and the Director of Public Prosecutions considering a retrial: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1).
	
	
	The Crown pointed to a number of factors in support of this submission. First, it was pointed out that the Crown case was opened on the basis that one of the issues the Crown was required to prove was that the appellant intended to import the substance into Australia, and that requirement was referred to again in closing. Next, the Crown relied upon the fact that trial counsel acceded to the directions given by her Honour to the jury. Finally, the Crown submitted that the evidence of the appellant’s guilt was overwhelming and the outcome of the trial inevitable, such that it could not be said that any miscarriage of justice occurred.
	
	
	In the Court’s opinion, had it been necessary to decide the matter, we would have concluded that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred in this case. In coming to that conclusion, we would not have placed much, if any, reliance upon the position taken by trial counsel. If her Honour was led into error by that position, and misdirected the jury in a way that did give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice, it would have been an error by this Court to allow that miscarriage to go uncorrected.
	
	
	However, having regard to the evidence, we agree with the Crown submission that this was an overwhelming Crown case and the guilty verdict was inevitable. For that reason, even if error in the directions had been established, we would have dismissed the appeal.

2701614,R v Merrick (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 661,"Judgment


	
	During the course of his trial for the murder of Marika Ninness, which commenced before this Court on 29 February 2016, Ross Merrick gave an account of the events of the night of 7 December 2013 which was wholly inconsistent with either the commission of the offence of murder, with which he stood indicted, or the commission of the statutory alternative of manslaughter. By the verdict of guilty to the alternative charge, returned by the jury on 29 March 2016, the jury necessarily rejected his evidence as to what had occurred that night.
	
	
	The offender sought acquittal for both charges from the jury and his case was, reduced to its essentials, one of accident.
	
	
	It was the offender’s sworn evidence that, whilst there was some contact between his elbow and Ms Ninness in the car park of the Greenhills Shopping Centre at East Maitland late on the night of 7 December 2013, he was not criminally responsible for the injuries sustained by her, or for her subsequent death on 21 December 2013. Since the Crown case for both murder and manslaughter relied upon the same factual events, necessarily it was the mental element of murder that the jury did not accept proved to the requisite standard.
	
	
	By the verdict of guilty returned to the alternative charge of manslaughter, the jury indicated that it did accept beyond reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately struck Ms Ninness a blow to the head which was both unlawful and dangerous, and that this act led to Ms Ninness’s death two weeks later.
	
	
	It now falls to this Court to determine the facts of the crime, consistent with the verdict of the jury, and to pass sentence upon the offender for the manslaughter of Ms Ninness. In so doing, it is necessary for the Court to find that any fact adverse to the offender has been proved on the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270, at [27].
	


The Background to the Events of 7 December 2013


	
	Ms Ninness and the offender met earlier in 2013 through online contact via Facebook. They commenced a relationship soon after, in March or April 2013. At that stage, and for the whole of the ensuing period until Ms Ninness was fatally injured, the offender was employed interstate on a “fly in – fly out” basis, and lived in either Port Macquarie or in the Maitland area, during those periods when he was not away for work.
	
	
	Ms Ninness lived for part of that time with her three children and a friend, Ms Megan Beukers, but from around September 2013 she and the children lived with the offender at a property the couple leased in Ashtonfield.
	
	
	Whilst there is no doubt on the evidence that Ms Ninness loved the offender, at least initially, the relationship was tumultuous. During the trial, the Court heard evidence from family and friends of Ms Ninness who had had an opportunity to observe aspects of the relationship, and the weight of the evidence was that it was a deeply troubled one.
	
	
	Evidence from witnesses and in the form of text messages (Exhibit AH), established that there were frequent, albeit short lived, separations between the couple, and Ms Ninness expressed considerable ambivalence about her relationship with the offender and its continuation.
	
	
	The text messages, in particular, evidence frequent running arguments between the couple, with abusive and derogatory language routinely employed, by both, but to a significantly greater extent by the offender. Ms Ninness on an occasion accused him in text exchanges of posting crudely abusive information about her on the public website Facebook (in late November 2013). The offender, in his evidence, did not seek to deny that he had done as Ms Ninness asserted he had.
	
	
	There was an instance of violence from the offender to Ms Ninness on 27 October 2013, documented in the text messages, and reported by Ms Ninness to others. On that occasion, the couple had argued in their bedroom in the Ashtonfield house, and the offender had assaulted Ms Ninness, such that she attended hospital for treatment.
	
	
	Ms Ninness’s eldest child was at home when this argument occurred, and heard raised voices followed by a loud banging sound. The sound is likely to have been caused by the offender propelling Ms Ninness into a wall, causing her head to penetrate the cladding of the wall. There was additionally an injury occasioned to Ms Ninness’s tailbone.
	
	
	Speaking to Ms Ninness’s son immediately after this assault, the offender told the child that he hadn’t known his own strength.
	
	
	The volatility of the relationship is clear from the history of it, evidenced to a considerable extent by text messages exchanged between the couple, and to some extent, from those exchanged between Ms Ninness and her friends, and the offender and Ms Ninness’s friends.
	
	
	It seems that Ms Ninness tried repeatedly to end her relationship with the offender and, just before she was fatally injured, had determined to leave him, it seems intending to reconcile with her husband. As late as 4 December 2013, Ms Ninness tearfully told one of her friends, Karleen Jones, that she feared for her life and wanted to leave the offender, but could not as she was frightened that he might hurt her. She said that she planned to leave him as soon as their joint lease of the Ashtonfield house expired. On the same day she told another friend, Kristy Hardy, that the offender had threatened to kill her or her husband if she left him. She asked to borrow money from a business acquaintance, telling him something like she needed to get out of her home and away from her boyfriend, before she was killed.
	
	
	The broader history of the relationship and its abusive nature, and the assault of 27 October 2013, is of relevance not because the offender is to be sentenced for it, but because of what it says about the offender’s prior, generally good, character, and because of the warning that it should have constituted to the offender about his conduct towards Ms Ninness.
	
	
	Although he showed some reluctance to acknowledge this obvious fact in evidence (T755), he was a much bigger individual than Ms Ninness, and very much stronger than her physically. The injury he did her on 27 October 2013 should have been a clear warning to him about the harm he could cause if violent towards Ms Ninness.
	


The Events of 7 December 2013


	
	On the evening of 7 December 2013 Ms Ninness accompanied the offender to the George Tavern (“the Tavern”) at East Maitland. CCTV footage records their arrival there at about 9 pm. They remained at the Tavern for the next two and a half hours or so, placing bets, playing pool, and drinking. Until shortly before they left, their interaction appeared to be that of an affectionate couple.
	
	
	Although it was in issue at trial, the precise number of drinks each consumed is not certain. Suffice it to say that it was not so much as to affect the capacity of either to function in a normal way, as is evident from the footage from the George Tavern and from McDonalds, (Exhibits P & Q) with each walking in an unaffected way, Ms Ninness in her customary high heels, and sending text messages without apparent difficulty (see also T235:50 and T237:38). The level of intoxication of either was not such as to have any further bearing on the events of this night in my conclusion.
	
	
	Shortly before each separately left the Tavern, there was an argument between the offender and Ms Ninness. Since I would not accept the evidence of the offender about the events of this night unless it is supported by evidence independent of him, his evidence being evasive, implausible, and given in a manner indicative of mendacity, it is not possible to say what prompted the argument. Others observed the offender to proffer his face to Ms Ninness, and demand of her, “Just hit me” (Michael Farley, T236: 50).
	
	
	Sidney Atkinson, working in the bar of the Tavern that night, saw a confrontation, and a heated discussion, and noted that the offender seemed to be “…standing over her a little” (T248:10). The attention of another of the bar staff, Zoe Styles, was drawn to the offender when he put his glass down on the bar “pretty… hard”, and demanded of Ms Ninness, “Are you fucking coming or not?” (T242:01 – 03).
	
	
	The offender walked out of the bar alone. Ms Ninness remained for a short time before also leaving. Significantly, she chose not to follow the offender, or go to his car.
	
	
	Ms Ninness made her way alone to the McDonalds restaurant at Greenhills, a short walk from the Tavern across Molly Morgan Drive. She ordered some food and waited for it to be served. She then stood for a short time eating the food she had bought. She was observed by another customer at the restaurant, Adellemaree Thomson, who had gone there with her children after an outing to see Christmas lights.
	
	
	Whilst Ms Ninness was at the restaurant, the offender sent her a text message at 23:40, telling her, “You can get the kids out tonight.” He refused her suggestion that he pick her up with a message, “I Al t Moving” and “Fuck u, u can come” (Exhibit S).
	
	
	Ms Ninness left McDonalds, walking across Molly Morgan Drive and the shopping centre car park in the direction of the shopping complex. She did not walk in the direction of the offender’s car, parked closer to the Tavern.
	
	
	Ms Thomson, who was watching Ms Ninness, saw a male, the offender, approach Ms Ninness as she walked along, apparently endeavouring to get her attention. Ms Ninness kept walking, with the offender walking beside and sometimes in front of her. There is evidence that both were moving their arms and gesticulating.
	
	
	Ms Thomson was sufficiently concerned by the offender’s actions to continue to watch the pair as they walked. At a point part way along the pathway through the shopping centre car park she saw the offender, who was then facing Ms Ninness, stop and swing an arm with elbow bent towards her, striking Ms Ninness to the head. Whilst the offender argued at trial that Ms Thomson’s evidence was unreliable and should not be accepted, the motion she described and demonstrated (T362-3; T370) was remarkably similar to that the offender himself demonstrated to others, and in CCTV footage, soon after. That is, a forceful and vigorous swinging motion of the arm, from right to left across the body at about shoulder height, with fist closed and elbow bent.
	
	
	Ms Thomson, a wholly independent witness whose evidence I regard as generally reliable, saw Ms Ninness drop instantly to the ground, falling she thought, to a level lower than that to which she had been standing. She saw the offender move off for a distance of several metres, before returning to Ms Ninness’ side.
	
	
	William George was also at McDonalds at about this time, getting takeaway at the drive through that runs parallel with Molly Morgan Drive. He saw the offender and Ms Ninness walking up the footpath between the drive through and the roadway and observed them to be having an argument. Ms Ninness was walking in front of the offender at that point and, from what Mr George saw, he thought that she wanted the offender to leave her alone and was trying to get away from him (T344). Although he could not hear what the offender said, he heard Ms Ninness yelling “Leave me alone. Go away from me” (T345:4-5). He saw Ms Ninness push the offender, and characterised what the offender was doing as “trying to egg her on” (T345:9) and “offering for her to hit him” (T345: 13).
	
	
	Conduct of the nature that Mr George described in his evidence is similar to that observed by Michael Farley minutes before in the Tavern, and the coincidence leads me to conclude that each was accurate in their evidence about this, and the offender was trying to provoke Ms Ninness to hit him.
	
	
	The offender denied that he pursued Ms Ninness, or that she told him to leave her alone, but I am satisfied that the evidence of Ms Thomson and Mr George in this regard is reliable and should be accepted.
	
	
	At a point when the offender and Ms Ninness were on the pathway through the car park, still apparently arguing, Mr George turned away to take his order and, when he again looked towards them, he saw that the female was on the ground. Clearly the blow struck by the offender that felled Ms Ninness was struck quickly, consistent with the vigorous action seen by Ms Thomson, and later demonstrated to others by the offender.
	
	
	As with Ms Thomson, Mr George saw the offender walk off in the direction of the Tavern where, the evidence establishes, his car was parked. Again, despite the offender’s denials in cross-examination, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not immediately go to Ms Ninness’s aid, instead walking away from her prone body for some steps, before returning to her side to try to assist her.
	
	
	Adam Kuskunovic was at the shopping centre to pick up his step-daughter who had been out with her boyfriend, coincidentally also at the George Tavern. He saw a man and a woman who were facing each other, arguing. The man was standing with his back to Mr Kuskunovic. He mistakenly thought the couple was his step-daughter and her boyfriend and, seeing something that caused him to believe his step-daughter was “getting attacked” (T453), he ran towards the couple. He saw the woman fall to the ground, although he did not see any contact between the man and woman, no doubt because of the way they stood relevant to his position, and because he was running.
	
	
	That Mr Kuskunovic did not see the offender walk away and then return is not significant in my view, given that, since he thought at that stage that it was his step-daughter on the ground, his focus would have been entirely on the fallen woman.
	
	
	When Mr Kusunovic reached the pair the offender was kneeling beside a prostrate Ms Ninness saying, “I’m sorry Marika, I didn’t mean to do this” (T453:32-33). He asked the offender what he had done, and the offender told him, “We had [an] argument and I hit her with the elbow” (T453:33-34). The offender also referred to having served in Iraq. He told Judith Kuskunovic, who did not see what occurred but followed her husband to where Ms Ninness lay, that “I’ve done this before, I’ve hit her before” (T467:38; 50).
	
	
	Janelle Allan who, after completing an evening shift, went to Greenhills to do some late night shopping, was also in the car park at this time. She saw something in her peripheral vision, a male, the offender, move his arm, and a woman, Ms Ninness, fall. At the time, she was some distance away and could only see the offender in silhouette. She heard an older man (Mr Kuskunovic) yelling, “he hit her, he hit her” (T497:24-25; T499: 27; T503:29). I accept that this occurred, even though Mr Kuskunovic did not give evidence of having said those words, and was without memory of it.
	
	
	Ms Allan described the arm movement of the male and, although she referred to the arm as the man’s left, setting aside the question of which arm it was, her description is entirely consistent with those of Ms Thomson and of the offender. She saw the male’s arm up, with the left hand above shoulder height, move parallel to the ground with the elbow bent. She saw the woman fall (T497 – 498).
	
	
	On all of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an argument between the offender and Ms Ninness at the Tavern and the offender became angry. As Mr Farley observed, he tried to provoke her into hitting him. The offender walked out of the Tavern alone, after speaking aggressively to Ms Ninness (“are you fucking coming?”). Ms Ninness did not follow the offender, but went to McDonalds alone. The offender was still very angry, demonstrated by the text message he sent her demanding that she remove her children, including a very small child, from their shared home that night.
	
	
	When she did not come to him, as he also demanded of her by text message, he sought her out and pursued her up the street, despite her clear indications that she wanted him to leave her alone. His conduct was such that, although there were only a relatively small number of people in the area at such a late hour, the attention of both Ms Thomson and Mr George was drawn to what was happening, and both watched as events unfolded, with Mr George turning away momentarily only to get his food.
	
	
	At a point on the pathway through the car park approaching the shopping centre, the offender deliberately struck Ms Ninness a vigorous blow to the head, of some force, as seen by Ms Thomson and described and demonstrated by the offender. Although I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to precisely where the blow landed on Ms Ninness’s head, or whether the blow was delivered with a fist or an elbow, the latter being the most likely, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, enraged by the argument he had had with Ms Ninness, and by her refusal to go to him, deliberately and vigorously swung a blow of some force and velocity (T411) directed at her head area, that connected with her head. That blow caused her to fall immediately to the ground.
	
	
	Having regard to the evidence of Lieutenant Commander Alfonso Santos, I do not accept, even on the balance of probabilities, that the offender’s conduct was in any way connected with his military training. Lieutenant Commander Santos deposed that there was no instruction to Navy personnel in the use of an elbow strike, although conversely there was instruction as to the dangerousness of blows to the head, neck or spine of an individual (T582-583), with such blows to be avoided.
	
	
	Necessarily, consistent with the jury’s verdict, the blow struck by the offender was one delivered without him having formed any intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm. It was an expression of rage and anger, an explosion of temper that caused him to lash out at Ms Ninness, striking her to the head.
	
	
	The offender did that despite his much greater strength and size, and despite having some warning from the events of 27 October 2013 of the danger of the application of force by him to Ms Ninness.
	
	
	As a result of the blow, Ms Ninness fell to the ground, striking her head on the hard surface of the car park, or perhaps on a concrete wheel stop in the vicinity. It is not possible to deconstruct the precise origins of the particular injuries sustained by Ms Ninness, but it is not necessary to do so. It is enough for the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as I am, that the offender’s unlawful and dangerous act caused those injuries. Ms Ninness sustained severe and ultimately fatal head injuries from the blow, or the resultant collision with the ground when she was knocked from her feet, or from the combination of both applications of force. However sustained, the offender is criminally liable for the injuries Ms Ninness received.
	
	
	Bystanders, including Madelyn Butt, Mr Kuskunovic’s step-daughter, attempted to assist Ms Ninness, as did the offender. A number of calls were placed to the Triple 0 service, including one in which the offender spoke to the emergency operator. The transcript informs the offender’s state of mind at that time to a degree, but hearing his tone and manner of speech in the recording is most illuminating of the issue, particularly his claim in a rough and angry tone that Ms Ninness was “alright”.
	
	
	Whilst I do not doubt that the offender, on realising that Ms Ninness was seriously injured, became very anxious about her, his initial response as caught in the Triple 0 recording is almost dismissive, and reflects his earlier movement away from her and towards his car, described by Ms Thomson and Mr George, that I am satisfied to the requisite standard occurred. Such a movement, albeit of fleeting duration, is consistent with the rage that had caused the offender to strike out unthinkingly at Ms Ninness.
	
	
	Paramedics arrived at about 12.06am to find Ms Ninness deeply unconscious and not responsive to stimuli (T486-7). There was blood in the vicinity of her left ear, and a quantity of blood was later found on the bitumen surface of the car park (T487). Paramedic Matthew Ross recalled that “the majority of her head was covered in blood”, and there was “a soft boggy section to her skull” behind the left ear (T509:37; T511:16-17). Her limbs were abnormally extended indicating severe brain injury, her pupils fixed and dilated.
	
	
	The offender told Officer Ross that there had been an argument and he had “elbowed” Ms Ninness in the face (T509:11-12). He demonstrated the movement to Officer Ross, who in turn demonstrated it for the jury. The movement was one of the right arm swinging in, across the body, and upwards (T510). During his demonstration, Officer Ross held his fingers closed in a fist, but when asked a clarifying question by myself, he said he was not certain whether the offender’s hand was closed or open (T510:33- 34).
	
	
	Other than the issue of the closed or open position of the fingers, the motion the witness demonstrated was consistent with the description given in evidence by Ms Thomson of what she saw, and also with the demonstrations of the offender to police officers and later in the police holding cells at Maitland Police Station.
	
	
	Upon admission to the John Hunter Hospital at about 12.45 on the morning of 8 December 2013 Ms Ninness’s condition was dire, with a Glasgow Coma Score so low as to be indicative of impending brain death. A CT scan revealed a large subdural haematoma with significant mass effect which required immediate surgery. There was very substantial mid-line shift of up to 20 millimetres, where a shift exceeding 5 millimetres is ordinarily regarded as quite significant. A fine linear fracture which extended full thickness through the petrous temporal bone on the left side was observed. On surgery considerable damage to the brain and the blood vessels to the brain was noted.
	
	
	Despite extensive and exemplary surgical intervention to save Ms Ninness’ life, she showed no sign of recovery, with further manifestations of injury appearing. Diabetes insipidis was noted, consequent upon damage to the hypothalamus gland. Injury of that nature typically points to very severe brain injury. An MRI scan showed “very significant damage throughout the brain stem, particularly through parts of the brain stem involved with cardio-respiratory function” and involving the “whole right side of the brain” (T420:27-29). Neurosurgeon Dr James Dimou, whose evidence before the jury was compelling, described the brain injury as “extreme and extraordinarily severe” (T420:35). He deposed that the extent of damage to the brain was consistent with that more typically seen in a high velocity event such as a motor vehicle crash (T411:4-5).
	
	
	Ultimately, active care was withdrawn and Ms Ninness died on 21 December 2013, in the arms of her sister and husband.
	


The Gravity of the Crime


	
	The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period specified. The maximum penalty specified by s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is both a guidepost to the Court and an indication of how seriously the community views the unlawful taking of a life.
	
	
	It is because of the loss of human life inherent in the crime that the Parliament has seen fit to fix a maximum penalty of such length.
	
	
	In determining the sentence to be imposed upon the offender, a vital part of that determination is an assessment of the objective gravity of the crime: R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. The sentence fixed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence, and capable of adequately reflecting it, consistent with the principles of sentencing.
	
	
	A number of features of this offence serve to mark it as a particularly egregious example of manslaughter.
	



	
	It occurred in the context of a domestic relationship, in circumstances where Ms Ninness should have been able to rely upon the offender to, at least, do her no harm.
	
	
	It occurred in circumstances where the offender had warning of the potential for him to physically hurt Ms Ninness. He had previously applied force to her and caused her some injury, including short loss of consciousness, and soft tissue injury to the lower back (Exhibit L). Having told one of Ms Ninness’s children on that occasion that he did not know his own strength, the offender must have been alive to his greater strength, and the potential for him to do injury to Ms Ninness.
	
	
	Ms Ninness had herself warned the offender of the likelihood of him injuring her, cautioning him in a text message that he was “nuts”, and “will end up killing someone… probably me” (Exhibit AH, 40063). She had urged him to seek professional help, but he did not do so, saying in a text message that there was, in effect, no point (Exhibit AH, 38713).
	
	
	Whilst the instigator and cause of the argument cannot be known, Ms Ninness chose not to follow the offender after he left the Tavern and not to continue the argument. When the offender sought her out, she told him to leave her alone and tried to walk away from him. The offender ignored her wishes and pursued her, continuing with the argument. His rising anger and agitation should have caused him to accede to Ms Ninness’s wishes, particularly having regard to the warning that the incident of 27 October 2013 should have provided to him. He did not.
	
	
	Having pursued Ms Ninness to continue the argument, it was the offender who escalated it by resorting to violence, in an outburst of rage. Whilst there is evidence that both were waving their arms about during the verbal argument, I do not accept the evidence of the offender, unsupported by any other testimony, that Ms Ninness lunged at him, precipitating an instinctive response.
	
	
	There was no provocation by Ms Ninness, and nothing that could have led to the offender’s act, other than his own state of rage.
	
	
	The blow was struck by the offender in a vigorous movement of some force and directed to the head area, a particularly vulnerable part of the body, as the offender well knew from his naval training.
	
	
	Although it is not possible to assess the precise level of force used by the offender in striking Ms Ninness, I accept the weight of the expert medical evidence (Dr Dimou and Dr Cala) that it must have been a blow of some force, delivered with some velocity. It is significant that Dr Dimou, who had the opportunity of seeing the injures to Ms Ninness prior to medical intervention, regarded it as an injury of such an extent as to be comparable to those seen more typically in passengers in car crashes.
	
	
	Necessarily, having regard to the verdict of the jury, the act of the offender was one where a reasonable person in the offender’s position would have realised that the act exposed Ms Ninness to a risk of serious injury. I am satisfied that the offender also had this realisation having regard to:
	



	
	The earlier incident of 27 October 2013 from which the offender was aware of his capacity to injure the much smaller Ms Ninness by the application of force to her; and
	
	
	His military training which instructed personnel to avoid strikes to the head because of the inherent danger of blows to that area of the body.
	



	
	The location of this attack was a public place, where others were exposed to this conduct, and witnessed all or part of it.
	



	
	On all of the evidence I regard this as a very serious example of manslaughter, even having regard to the many and varied ways in which manslaughter may be committed, and the many and varied factual circumstances that may be encountered with such an offence.
	


The Victim Impact Statements


	
	The Court has received and heard from David Blackie and Charnie Braz, Ms Ninness’s husband and sister respectively, who each gave a statement of the impact of the offender’s crime upon Ms Ninness’s family, read to the Court pursuant to s 30A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“CSPA”). The statements were received by the Court pursuant to s 28(4) of the CSPA.
	
	
	Section 28(4) provides for a victim impact statement to constitute evidence of harm to which a sentencing court may have regard.
	
	
	The victim impact statements, so movingly delivered to the Court, provide direct and very personal evidence of the loss that the death of a member of the community in violent and unexpected circumstances causes, and the impact of that loss on those left behind. The Court heard eloquent expressions of the grief and pain left to Ms Ninness’s family and friends to endure, as a consequence of this crime.
	
	
	Ms Ninness was a mother, wife, daughter, sister, and friend, and her violent death has forever changed the lives of those who loved her. Her loss has caused profound harm, particularly so to her three children, who, by the offender’s crime, have been deprived of their mother. This is a loss of unimaginable proportions.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the victim impact statements may be used in determining the punishment to be imposed upon the offender, as they demonstrate the harm done by him, a harm which is elevated by the loss to Ms Ninness’s children of their mother.
	
	
	Ms Evers for the offender, whilst conceding that the loss to Ms Ninness’ family is considerable, submitted that the children are well supported, and their loss is mitigated to some degree by the family love with which they are surrounded.
	
	
	Those competing submissions to some extent illustrate why courts sentencing offenders for an offence involving death have consistently refused to delineate the particular harm caused by an individual’s death. That exercise involves the Court in putting a value on the life of the individual. Here, the Crown argued that the harm caused by Ms Ninness’s death was elevated because she was a mother of three children; the offender’s representative sought to diminish the harm by arguing that the children had others to care for and support them. In my view, determining competing arguments of that nature is something that the courts should avoid.
	
	
	I do not interpret s 28(4) of the CSPA to raise a basis for a sentencing court to find that the harm caused by a crime such as this is either aggravated or mitigated by the extent of the loss occasioned by the death of the victim. An assessment of that nature would involve the sentencing courts in an evaluation of the value of an individual life, measured by the pain and loss caused by the death. By that exercise, for example, the unlawful killing of a skilled doctor could be regarded more seriously than the unlawful killing of someone without those skills. That is an assessment no court should undertake in my view, because the gravity of the crime is the unlawful taking of a human life.
	
	
	I do not understand the victim impact statements received by the Court to worsen the offender’s crime. The information provided by a victim impact statement is demonstrative of the harm that is inherent in an offence of manslaughter, and should be viewed consistent with the principles expressed in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 which, in my view, remains good law.
	
	
	The death of Ms Ninness at the offender’s hands has led to great harm and immense grief. That harm is part of the offence of manslaughter.
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case


	
	The offender’s criminal antecedents are relatively confined. He has convictions in Western Australia for a drink driving offence and one of disorderly behaviour in a public place, both from November 2008 and dealt with in April 2009, and driving offences from June 2009, dealt with in April 2010.
	
	
	Except insofar as alcohol had a part to play in at least one of those offences, they are of no relevance to the present offending. They are not such as to deny the offender a measure of leniency that recognises the lack of serious offending in his past.
	
	
	Since entering custody after the return of the jury’s verdict on 29 March 2016, the offender has not incurred any institutional conduct offences.
	


The Subjective Case


	
	The offender’s case on sentence was very limited.
	
	
	He gave evidence himself, although only to assert the truthfulness of the history he had given to a psychiatrist he consulted for the purpose of obtaining a report to be tendered on sentence.
	
	
	Given the brevity of his evidence in chief, cross-examination was also very limited. Of some significance was the offender’s evidence during cross-examination that he maintains the version of events of 7 December 2013 that he gave in evidence at his trial. That is of some relevance to questions of remorse and rehabilitation and I will return to it.
	
	
	The offender’s claims in that regard appear to be echoed in the report of Dr Michael Giuffrida, where it is noted that Ms Ninness was injured when she “fell onto the concrete pathway” (Giuffrida, p.2).
	
	
	The offender is currently 32 years of age. He was 30 years old when he killed Ms Ninness.
	
	
	In the history the offender gave to Dr Giuffrida he described a childhood spent in Perth, Ipswich in Queensland, Port Stephens, Richmond, and Raymond Terrace, with his family moving from time to time as a consequence of his mother and step-father’s military postings. His schooling was unremarkable, although the offender reported truanting regularly.
	
	
	The offender’s mother and step-father remain supportive, and he has on-going contact with his siblings. The offender has renewed contact with his father, who has visited him in prison.
	
	
	At age 17 the offender left home to join the Royal Australian Navy, in the service of which he spent the next 7 or 8 years. The offender was posted overseas and spent time on active service in the Middle East, including involvement in boarding boats suspected of hostile intent. He told Dr Giuffrida that he had a leadership role, and was deployed in dangerous and challenging missions.
	
	
	That is broadly consistent with evidence from Lieutenant Commander Santos, to the effect that the offender had joined the Navy on 11 September 2000, being discharged in July 2008.
	
	
	The offender assured Dr Giuffrida that he chose to leave the Navy, perhaps feeling a degree of disenchantment with the military (Giuffrida, p.10).
	
	
	Rather in contrast to the offender’s immediate assertions to persons at the scene on 7 December 2013 that his military service had adversely affected him, and was in some way responsible for what had occurred (a claim I have rejected), the offender did not initially express any concerns to Dr Giuffrida about the consequences to him of deployment in potentially dangerous situations during overseas service. He similarly reported having no more than a “fifteen minute chat” with a Navy psychologist following active service, with assurances that he was “fine” (Giuffrida, p.6).
	
	
	Dr Giuffrida has concluded nevertheless that the offender has experienced a number of symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, such as sleeplessness, anxiety, and nightmares. There is nothing in the doctor’s report to causally link these symptoms or a post-traumatic stress disorder to the events of 7 December 2013.
	
	
	The offender gave Dr Giuffrida a history of two prior significant relationships, both of which ended, he said, because of the jealousy of his partners. The offender has a 14 year old child from his first relationship, but he has no contact at all with the child. A relationship formed after Ms Ninness was killed, and when the offender was at liberty subject to bail, has resulted in the impending birth of a second child.
	
	
	The offender’s relationship with Ms Ninness was his third of significance, and jealousy figured here too, although in Dr Giuffrida’s opinion the problematic jealousy on this occasion was the offender’s. The doctor described the offender’s jealousy of Ms Ninness as “free floating [...] independent of facts” (Giufrida, p.8). Certainly the evidence of the text messages exchanged between the offender and Ms Ninness suggests that his jealousy contributed to what he told Dr Giuffrida were arguments “like nothing on earth” (Giuffrida, p.8).
	
	
	The offender also gave Dr Giuffrida an account of drug and alcohol use such as to lead the doctor to opine that he has a Substance or Stimulant Use Disorder to a severe degree, and an Alcohol Use Disorder. The offender described daily use of stimulants, mainly cocaine, with an addiction to cocaine commencing in 2011 or 2012, and a habit of use of one gram or more each day. Dr Giuffrida categorised the offender’s addiction as “extremely serious” (Giuffrida, p.9). The offender has also used ecstasy and amphetamine on occasion, and referred to his last use of an illegal drug as occurring in 2015.
	
	
	The offender also has a problem with alcohol abuse, describing to Dr Giuffrida binge drinking vast quantities of beer with the object of getting drunk. In a state of drunkenness the offender has confessed to getting into fights with men, something that has also happened on the football field.
	
	
	Whilst finding the offender an “unusual and contradictory character” (Giuffrida, p.11), with aspects of his past such as events leading to childhood consultations with a psychiatrist, unknowable, Dr Giuffrida has concluded that the offender has an underlying depressive mood state, and displays symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder. He refers to the offender’s jealousy as taking on a life of its own, although without becoming pathological or delusional. He suggests that “it may be the case” that his symptomology made him more vulnerable to jealous feelings (Giuffrida p.12).
	
	
	Dr Giuffrida is of the view that the offender would benefit from ongoing treatment to address substance abuse, and psychotherapy directed to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. He refers to the need for dual action anti-depressants, medication available to the offender currently.
	
	
	A number of character references were tendered for the offender, although none of the authors other than Shanae Fletcher gave evidence before the Court or was cross-examined. Ms Fletcher, a cousin of the offender, was called to give evidence supportive of a submission from counsel for the offender that the offender had been subjected to what was referred to as extra-curial punishment, but she was not in the event able to testify to anything of that nature, and the submission was abandoned.
	
	
	The character referees – family members, friends from sport or the gymnasium, a former colleague, and the offender’s current partner - all speak highly of the offender. He is described as a responsible and hard-working man with high standards of personal conduct who is unfailingly courteous, generous, and loyal. His involvement in sport is praised, as is his willingness to coach younger players, and help others in need beyond the sports field. Those who wrote references expressed their surprise at the offender’s current situation, and some specifically referred to the events of 7 December 2013 as being out of character.
	
	
	That evidence, whilst clearly heartfelt, must be viewed through the prism of objective fact. For example, although the offender’s mother referred to her son as “at all times strictly adhering to the conditions of his bail” (Exhibit 7, p.3), that must be contrasted with the offender’s admissions to Dr Giuffrida to having used prohibited drugs into 2015, something contrary to both his conditions of bail, and the criminal law. The testaments to his gentle and trustworthy nature need to be considered in light of his heavy and longstanding cocaine and other drug use, and his occasional involvement in fistfights when drinking or on the football field, together with the viciousness of the abuse frequently levelled at Ms Ninness by the offender during the course of their brief relationship.
	
	
	The referees also refer to the grief and sadness the offender has expressed over Ms Ninness’ death. That is consistent with the distress seen by witnesses who had occasion to observe him on the night of 7 December 2013 and into the following morning, and I do not doubt the magnitude of his grief. Grief, however, must be distinguished from remorse. It is possible to feel bereft at the death of a loved one without feeling the weight of responsibility for that death.
	
	
	In light of the offender’s evidence at trial of the circumstances of Ms Ninness’ death, and his insistence in evidence on 9 May 2016 that his account was correct, I am not able to conclude that the offender is remorseful for his crime as contemplated by s 21A of the CSPA. Before the jury the offender repeatedly sought to diminish his conduct. He claimed that he had not been angry with Ms Ninness on 7 December 2016 but only annoyed, that his abuse of and threats towards her at times in their relationship were merely childish, that his previous assault of her was “just an accident” (T729:05). I accept that he feels sorry that Ms Ninness died, and feels sadness for her children, but I do not accept that he is remorseful for his conduct, or feels personally responsible for her death.
	
	
	The lack of remorse has some limited impact upon his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	What can be taken from the references tendered on the offender’s behalf is his history of hard work and loyal friendship, his pride in his valuable military service to his country, and the devotion of his friends and family to him.
	


Sentencing – Manslaughter Offences


	
	Sentencing principles that apply in a case such as the present are well-established.
	
	
	It has long been recognised that of all serious offences, manslaughter attracts the widest range of possible sentences: R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; (2005) 222 CLR 67 at [22] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. As was there stated, the culpability of a person convicted of manslaughter may fall just short of that of a person guilty of murder, or it may be such that a nominal penalty would suffice.
	
	
	As has frequently been recognised, the fundamental touchstone for sentencing in cases of manslaughter is that there has been an unlawful taking of human life for which the offender has been found criminally liable and for which he must be sentenced: R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1995, unrep).
	
	
	Section 3A of the CSPA sets out the purposes of sentencing, purposes the court must endeavour to achieve when determining the sentence to be passed upon an offender. Punishment, retribution, and deterrence all have a role to play, as well as denunciation of the offence, and the need for the offender’s rehabilitation. Particular regard must be given to the features relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence as well as to any mitigating circumstances.
	
	
	The maximum sentence provided by statute provides a guidepost to the Court.
	
	
	Some attention may be given to decided authorities, although the assistance to be found there must be acknowledged to be limited. The parties have referred the Court to a number of earlier decisions, including R v Bryce (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 1184; Field v R [2015] NSWCCA 332; and R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120. Annexed as Annexure A to the published account of this judgment will be a table (“the Table”) of earlier cases where sentence has been imposed for manslaughter. As the cases the parties have cited, and the Table, demonstrates, sentences for manslaughter vary greatly. Earlier decisions of the courts can inform the exercise of the sentencing discretion, but no more.
	
	
	No case is precisely like this one. No case exactly reflects the circumstances, objective and subjective, of this matter. No earlier sentence can dictate or even suggest the sentence to be imposed upon the offender for the crime he committed.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	A number of other features remain to be considered.
	


The Offer of the Plea of Guilty


	
	When arraigned before the jury panel on 1 March 2016 the offender entered a plea of not guilty to the charge on indictment of murder. He did not enter a plea of guilty to the alternative of manslaughter, although it was open to him to do so.
	
	
	During the course of the trial and after evidence was adduced without challenge that readily established the alternative, I raised the absence of challenge to the evidence, and the issue of the plea, with the offender’s counsel (T282-283). The relevant witnesses were recalled for cross-examination on the offender’s application and their evidence challenged, but no plea was entered to the alternative offence.
	
	
	Despite that factual history, the offender contends that he should be given a discount on sentence to reflect his offer, made some weeks prior to the commencement of his trial, to plead guilty to manslaughter. Whilst it is conceded that the plea offer was not made at an early stage, and there is thus no argument seeking a discount of 25% on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed, the offender submits that the discount awarded to him should be material. Reliance is placed upon R v Cardoso (2003) 137 A Crim R 535 and R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310.
	
	
	The Crown tendered email correspondence between it and counsel for the offender of 2 February 2016 in which it was confirmed that the offender “has instructed us to offer to plead to manslaughter, subject to agreed facts” (Sentence Exhibit A).
	
	
	The Crown referred the Court to the same decisions of Oinonen and Cardosa, and also to Morton v R [2014] NSWCCA 8; R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229; Villalon v R [2015] NSWCCA 229; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 52 MVR 528; and R v Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129.
	
	
	It is clear from the email exchange that the offer of a plea of guilty was a conditional one, made subject to some agreement being reached as to the factual basis of a plea to manslaughter. The offender has not placed any evidence before the Court as to the nature of the facts he would have regarded as acceptable prior to entering any plea. His counsel asserts in submission that he was not given an opportunity to negotiate facts because the Crown rejected the plea offer out of hand.
	
	
	It is undoubtedly the case that an offender who is convicted at trial may still be given a sentence appropriately reduced to reflect the utilitarian benefit of an offered plea, where there is a utilitarian benefit to reflect. The offender contends that there was utilitarian value in the offer he made.
	
	
	Section 22 of the CSPA requires the Court to have regard to the entry of a plea of guilty in determining the sentence to be imposed upon an offender. There was no plea in this case to give rise to s 22 considerations.
	
	
	The principles enunciated in R v Thompson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2002) 49 NSWLR 383 emphasise that the basis of a discount on sentence is the extent of the utilitarian value of the plea. The question to be determined is the extent to which the offender’s conditional offer advantaged the administration of justice. Borkowski at [32], endorsed in R v AB and many decisions since, has set out the considerations relevant to answer that question, and I have had regard to them.
	
	
	The offender’s case at trial was that he was not guilty of both murder and manslaughter, and that he should be acquitted of both charges. He advanced a positive defence asserting on his oath that no act of his made him criminally liable for Ms Ninness’ death. He asserted that Ms Ninness’ hand came up towards him and he put his arm across his face, essentially in a protective gesture. He said he felt some contact, and then saw Ms Ninness fall to the ground. What he described was neither unlawful nor dangerous.
	
	
	Evidence was adduced by the offender as to the height of the shoes worn by Ms Ninness, and her asserted state of intoxication, and it was suggested that she may, in effect, have tripped or fallen from her shoes and hit her head, whilst waving her arms at the offender during an animated exchange.
	
	
	Questions asked of the medical experts were based upon a premise that there had been no blow of any force struck by the offender, evidenced by the absence of any injury, it was asserted, to Ms Ninness’ head or face that could be attributed to such a blow. The medical evidence called in the Crown case was put to significant challenge, as was the evidence of any witness which contradicted the offender’s case of accident.
	
	
	The conclusion urged upon the jury was that the fatal injuries received by Ms Ninness were caused by the collision with the carpark surface, and were not occasioned by any act of the offender. His conduct was likened by his counsel in argument before the Court to the sort of motion one makes when moving an irritating insect away from one’s face, a motion which was neither unlawful nor dangerous.
	
	
	Having reviewed the evidence given on his oath by the offender, and accepting that the offender’s legal representatives could not, consistent with their obligations as officers of the Court, have called a positive case on his behalf if his sworn testimony significantly differed from his instructions as to the events of 7 December 2013, I cannot regard his conditional offer of a plea as any more than exploratory.
	
	
	I infer that no facts that would have supported a plea of guilty could have been acceptable to the offender having regard to his sworn evidence. Nothing in his conduct of his case was consistent with his guilt of manslaughter, and I am not able to discern any utilitarian benefit in the conduct of the trial overall.
	
	
	A trial fixed to continue for four weeks prior to any issue of a plea being raised in fact continued for four weeks. The offender made no concessions in evidence or in the cross-examination of witnesses which could justify a discount for a utilitarian benefit attaching to his conditional offer of a plea to the alternative count.
	
	
	I would respectfully adopt what was said by the Chief Judge at Common Law in Morton v R, at [32]:
	


“…There is no utility in a plea of guilty that has not been forthcoming. If the accused is not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown takes some course, then so be it.”

The Issue of Special Circumstances


	
	The offender submits that he should be given the benefit of a finding of special circumstances, and the non-parole period to be imposed upon him should be consequentially reduced: s 44(2) CSPA. Reliance is placed upon the conclusions of Dr Giuffrida that he has an alcohol abuse disorder and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder to justify such a finding.
	
	
	There is authority to the effect that a psychiatric or psychological disorder may ground a finding of special circumstances, but the existence of such a disorder does not mandate that finding.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind the purpose and rationale for a finding of special circumstances. The finding is not made simply as a means by which to shorten the non-parole period to be imposed; it is made because there is some legitimate need for a longer period of parole. Special circumstances, as the wording of the legislation, supported by authority (R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172, at [20]) makes clear, must be “special”.
	
	
	I accept that the offender has need for ongoing treatment for his depressive condition and other symptoms, and that he would benefit from assistance with alcohol rehabilitation (he appears to have dealt with his drug addiction given his assertion to Dr Giuffrida that he had not used illicit drugs since 2015, although I am mindful of the diagnosis). This does not automatically entitle him to a reduction in the non-parole period to be imposed.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the identified disorders will make the offender’s experience of a custodial environment more oppressive than for prisoners without his conditions, such that special circumstances should be found on that basis.
	
	
	By operation of the ordinary statutory ratio of sentence the offender will have the benefit of eligibility for release to a period of parole of some length, no doubt with supervision from the parole authorities. The parole period available as a statutory percentage will provide a reasonable period of supervision and support to the offender to engage with rehabilitative facilities, should such facilities continue to be necessary at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Upon release, the offender will also have the benefit of a loving and supportive family network to assist him to reintegrate into the community. There is no reason to conclude other than that he will have the advantage of accommodation with family to assist him when he is released. He has an excellent work history and strong work skills, and that background will also stand him in good stead to resume a law abiding and productive life in the community. Broadly speaking, the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation appear positive.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that more is needed by way of supervised release than is provided for by statute, and I decline to find that special circumstances exist such as to warrant a reduction in the non-parole period.
	


Deterrence


	
	Principles of specific and general deterrence both have a role to play in determining the sentence to be imposed upon the offender.
	
	
	Whilst the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are positive, there remains a need to deter him from the prospect of relapse into dealing violently with a partner who displeases him.
	
	
	Of perhaps even greater significance is the need for the sentence imposed upon the offender today to act as a deterrent to others from visiting unlawful physical violence on others. The sort of offence of which the offender has been convicted occurs with distressing frequency in the community. Frequently men – and it is most commonly young men – become angry and think it acceptable to express that anger physically. The consequences, as here, are catastrophic.
	
	
	There have recently been a number of instances of such violence before the courts where a life is lost because of an individual’s enraged outburst, and general deterrence must be given significant weight, as a means of protecting the community from further such instances: Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105; R v Carroll; Carroll v R [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45; R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120.
	
	
	There is also a need to send a very strong message to those in the community, again most typically men, and not excepting the offender, that violence is never an acceptable means of resolving disputes and difficulties in the context of a personal relationship, and the courts will vindicate those harmed by domestic violence.
	
	
	I cannot express the principle better than did the majority of the High Court in Ernest Munda v The State of Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 249 CLR 600, at [55], where French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ said:
	


“A consideration with a very powerful claim on the sentencing discretion in this case is the need to recognise that the appellant, by his violent conduct, took a human life, and, indeed, the life of his de facto spouse. A just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of the victim of domestic violence and the legitimate interest of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of a brutal, alcohol‑fuelled destruction of a woman by her partner. A failure on the part of the state to mete out a just punishment of violent offending may be seen as a failure by the state to vindicate the human dignity of the victim; and to impose a lesser punishment by reason of the identity of the victim is to create a group of second-class citizens, a state of affairs entirely at odds with the fundamental idea of equality before the law.”


	
	A conviction having been recorded against you on 9 May 2016 for the manslaughter of Marika Ninness, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months, to date from 22 March 2016, and expiring on 21 June 2024, with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months imprisonment, expiring on 21 March 2027. The total term of imprisonment is one of 11 years.
	
	
	You are advised that the offence of manslaughter is a “serious violent offence” as defined by s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). Section 25C of that Act requires the Court to advise you of the existence of the legislation, and of its application to the offence of manslaughter of which you have been convicted.
	
	
	I direct that a copy of the report of Dr Michael Giuffrida dated 16 April 2016 be placed with the warrant of commitment for transmission to the Corrective Services authorities.

2701620,"Perish, Anthony v R; Perish, Andrew v R; Lawton, Matthew v R [2016] NSWCCA 89","HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Anthony Perish (the first appellant), Andrew Perish (the second appellant) and Matthew Lawton (the third appellant) were jointly charged with conspiracy to murder Terrence Falconer (the deceased). The first and third appellants were jointly charged with the murder of the deceased. The first appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges but guilty to manslaughter, a plea that was not accepted by the Crown. The second and third appellants pleaded not guilty to all charges.

It was the Crown case that the first and second appellants, who were brothers, believed the deceased had murdered their grandparents. The Crown argued that the appellants planned and coordinated the abduction and murder of the deceased, who was on work release from Silverwater prison. The abduction was performed by three men including Witness E. Witness E’s car had been altered with wheels provided by the third appellant to give it the appearance of a detective’s car. The abductors, dressed as police officers, then purported to arrest the deceased. The deceased was handcuffed, subdued with chloroform or a similar agent, placed in a metal box and transferred to another van.

Witness E then drove the deceased, unconscious in the metal box, to the first appellant’s residence in Turramurra where the first and third appellants were waiting. There was conflicting evidence as to whether the deceased was alive when he arrived at Turramurra. It was submitted by the first appellant that his intention in directing the kidnapping of the deceased was to interrogate him and thereafter return him to prison. He submitted that the deceased was already dead when they opened the box at Turramurra. In a recorded interview with police, Witness E claimed the deceased was still alive when they reached Turramurra, that he attempted to get out of the box and that the first appellant slammed his head back down and shut the lid. At trial, Witness E claimed to not remember many of the key events but appeared to remember the deceased coughing in the back of the van when they arrived at Turramurra.

After a number of unfavourable responses to questions regarding what was said in the recorded interview, Witness E was determined to be an unfavourable Crown witness and, after consultation between the parties, an edited transcript of the recorded interview was admitted into evidence (Ex AA).

There was evidence that Witness E had given different accounts to different people, claiming that he was responsible for killing the deceased. Witness E claimed the reason for these different accounts was “because then if someone goes bad you can tell who”.

At trial, Witness C gave evidence that Witness E told him he was concerned that he was going to be in trouble with the first appellant because the deceased had died before he got to him but “[the first appellant] said that it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway”. No objection was made to this statement by trial counsel for the first appellant. In an affidavit filed by the first appellant, trial counsel for the first appellant indicated that she had not objected to the evidence as she wished to have the initial representation, that the deceased had died before they got to the first appellant, admitted into evidence and believed this could not happen if she objected to the latter representation.

It was common ground that after meeting at Turramurra, the first and third appellant and Witness E drove with the box to a property at Girvan, to which the first appellant had access. There they dismembered the body of the deceased using saw blades, packaged the body parts in plastic bags wrapped in chicken wire and disposed of the bags in the Hastings River. Witness E gave evidence that there were three plastic body suits available to be worn during the dismembering, plastic floor sheeting, a block and tackle to suspend the body and chemicals to clean the floor.

It was the Crown case that the appellants had initially made plans to dump the body parts at sea. This was derived from the evidence of Witness A, a member of the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Club (the Rebels), of which the second appellant was also a member. His evidence was obtained across a number of meetings with police, often in situations where the detectives could not take notes. He stated that he was approached at his home by the third appellant’s wife who handed him $1000 and told him to attend a dinner with the first appellant. A few days later, he was picked up by the second appellant and driven to dinner in Newtown. Present at the dinner were the first and second appellant. The first appellant proposed that he would pay for repairs to Witness A’s boat so that it could be used to dispose of human remains beyond the Continental Shelf. The first appellant told Witness A he would be waiting at a wharf in the Central Coast with eskys containing the body parts. The second appellant dropped Witness A home, gave him $2000 for boat repairs and told him a phone would be dropped to him the following day.

Witness A stated that he put the boat in for repairs the following morning. A receipt indicated that it was put in on 12 October 2001 yet phone records indicated that contact between Witness A and the second appellant began on 9 October 2001. A few days after the dinner, Witness A claimed the third appellant delivered a phone to him registered in the name McDowell (the McDowell phone) and told him it was from the first appellant.

Around a week after the dinner, Witness A stated that he travelled to Newcastle and the Salamander Bay area for reconnaissance with Witness F, his girlfriend at the time. Phone records from Witness A’s personal phones and a receipt from the Salamander Shores Hotel indicated he stayed there on 31 October 2001.

Witness A stated that he saw the second appellant on a number of occasions when he arranged for money to be given to Witness A for repairs and expenses. Witness A claimed he saw the first and third appellants on three to four occasions when they visited him at his home to check on the progress of the boat. He claimed that he recorded each of these visits on security cameras but that Witness F had accidentally taped over all but one. On the second last visit, Witness A stated that the first appellant showed him a police document revealing the deceased was prepared to give evidence against the Rebels. On the last visit, of which Witness A still had a recording, albeit without audio, Witness A claimed that the first appellant had told him to hurry up because “this cunt goes Friday regardless”.

Witness A gave evidence that he never intended on following through with the plan. After the final meeting, there was no further conversation between Witness A and the appellants and the McDowell phone was turned off. Phone records indicated that the second appellant attempted to call Witness A’s personal phone on the Wednesday and Thursday before the murder, which occurred on a Friday. The records could not establish if there was any attempt to contact the McDowell phone.

Witness F did not recall Witness A being handed the $1000 by the third appellant’s wife or taping over Witness A’s security tapes. She denied travelling with Witness A to Newcastle and Salamander Bay.

Witness A indicated that when he was approached by police he was in a state of hyper-vigilance and feared for his life as he had given evidence against the Rebels and had been stabbed 7 times when in custody in Lithgow gaol. While giving evidence to police he reported a number of bizarre incidents indicating paranoia.

Witness A agreed to speak to the second appellant while wearing a listening device. On one occasion he said “I need to know that fuckin’ piece of paper you showed me about Terry Falconer is gone because it’s got my fuckin’ prints on it”, referring to the document the first appellant had shown him on the second last visit. The second appellant had answered “It’s gone mate, don’t worry”. On another occasion, the recording was affected by background noise of which Witness A was not aware. He gave evidence that the second appellant said “nobody knows we done it”. This was not audible on the recording. On a further occasion Witness A said “Remember the conversation we had? … And you said nobody knows who done it?” the second appellant said “Yeah” and Witness A said “Fuckin’ everybody knows who done it”.

Witness B, a relative of the first and second appellant, gave evidence that the first appellant told him “we killed [the deceased] at [Witness E’s] mother’s property up the coast”. He also gave evidence that the first appellant said to the second appellant “this cunt’s been talking” and tapped the side of his nose. Witness B did not know that Witness A’s nickname was “Nosey”.

The trial judge gave warnings to the jury that Witness A and Witness E’s evidence should be scrutinised with care and was potentially unreliable by reason of them having been criminally involved in the matters about which they gave evidence.

The issues on appeal were:

First Appellant

1.   Whether a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of the evidence of Witness C that Witness E told him that the first appellant said “it didn’t matter [that the deceased had died before he got to the first appellant as] that’s how he would have ended up anyway” (the second hand hearsay evidence);

2.   Whether the trial judge erred in directing the jury with respect to the second hand hearsay evidence such that the evidence was available to the jury as evidence of an admission by the first appellant;

3.   Whether the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence where there was reasonable doubt as to whether the deceased was alive upon reaching Turramurra and otherwise rested significantly on the evidence of Witness A.

Second Appellant

1.   Whether the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or could not be supported on the evidence where the verdict against the second appellant rested mainly on the evidence of Witness A;

2.   Whether a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the second appellant being tried together with his co-accused;

3.   Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Third Appellant

1.   Whether the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence where the conclusion that the third appellant had any knowledge of the conspiracy prior to the deceased’s arrival at Turramurra rested on the evidence of Witnesses A and E;

2.   Whether a miscarriage of justice arose in circumstances where the trial judge directed the jury that the first appellant had offered to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter where that plea was inadmissible against the third appellant;

3.   Whether the trial judge erred in admitting Ex AA where the substance of Ex AA had not been put to Witness E in accordance with the prerequisites of s 106 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (Evidence Act);

4.   Whether the trial judge erred in directing the jury that it could take into account evidence of Witness A being given money by the second appellant as evidence of the third appellant’s participation in the charged conspiracy.

The Court held (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J) dismissing the appeal:

First appellant

Admission of second hand hearsay evidence

(i)   In circumstances where trial counsel made a conscious decision not to object to the evidence and there was, objectively speaking, a rational basis for not objecting to the evidence, admission of the evidence did not mean the first appellant lost the chance of an acquittal fairly open to him: [254]-[259] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 applied

(ii)   Even if it could not be said that the decision not to object to the evidence was a rational forensic decision, the first appellant did not in fact lose a real chance of acquittal where the Crown did not place reliance on the evidence complained of, where there was a caution about its use and where both parties contended the witness was unreliable: [274]-[277] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

ARS v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 266; Poniris v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 100 applied

Trial judge’s direction regarding the second hand hearsay evidence

(iii)   There is a consistent, although not uncontroversial, line of authority that the words “not admissible” mean “not admissible over objection”. That construction is not plainly wrong: [261]-[269] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

R v Reid [1999] NSWCCA 258; R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476; R v Lyberopoulos [2002] NSWCCA 280; R v Kaddour [2005] NSWCCA 303; 156 A Crim R 11; Gonzales v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232; WC v The Queen [2015] NSWCCA 52; Selstam v McGuinness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262; Gray v Ware Building Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 271; Commissioner of Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd [2011] FCAFC 74 applied

Velkoski v The Queen [2014] VSCA 141 considered

Walker v Walker [1937] HCA 44; 57 CLR 630 distinguished

(iv)   The construction of “not admissible” meaning “not admissible over objection” is consistent with the adversarial nature of a trial: [268], [270]-[271] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1 applied

(v)   The effect of the supported construction is ameliorated by the fact that the trial judge retains his or her overriding obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law and would thus have an obligation to exclude inadmissible evidence or direct a jury not to take account of a particular piece of evidence if it would otherwise deny a fair trial: [272] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107; James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; 253 CLR 475 applied

(vi)   Even if the trial judge’s direction was erroneous, the first appellant did not in fact lose a real chance of acquittal where the Crown did not place reliance on the evidence complained of, where there was a caution about its use and where both parties contended the witness was unreliable: [274]-[277] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

ARS v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 266; Poniris v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 100 applied

Unreasonable verdict

(vii)   Where a verdict is challenged as unreasonable, the appellate court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence. The verdict should be set aside only if the Court is still in doubt after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury and its benefit of having seen and heard the evidence: [327] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; M v The Queen [1994] HCA 16; 184 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 applied

(viii)   It was not unreasonable for the jury to believe the evidence of Witness A where his evidence of what was proposed bore a marked similarity to what in fact occurred and to reject the hypothesis that Witness A had discovered this information from other sources and weaved it into his story: [330] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(ix)   Whether Witness A’s testimony was put in doubt by his paranoid behaviour was a matter particularly for the jury who saw and heard his testimony: [331] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(x)   The objective evidence did not undermine Witness A’s testimony such that there was reasonable doubt regarding the key elements of his testimony: [332], [334] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(xi)   Even if the jury rejected the evidence of Witness E in some respects, namely whether the deceased was alive upon reaching Turramurra, it was open for the jury to accept his evidence in other respects, in particular the material that was available to dismember the body at the Girvan property, which supported an intention to murder the deceased: [336] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Second appellant

Unreasonable verdict

(xii)   When considering whether a verdict is unreasonable, the question for the Court is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, it would be dangerous in the circumstances to let the verdict of guilty stand, or put another way, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: [350] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

M v The Queen [1994] HCA 16; 184 CLR 487; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; R v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 242 CLR 491; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 applied

(xiii)   Where a verdict is challenged as unreasonable on the basis of the credibility of a witness, the Court must be acutely conscious of the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence the witness gave: [351], [354] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Atai v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 210; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 applied

(xiv)   Tortuous reasoning in order to explain every individual circumstance as being consistent with innocence should not be engaged in: [352] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

R v Micallef [2002] NSWCCA 480; 136 A Crim R 127; Burrell v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 193 applied

(xv)   In circumstances where Witness A came under sustained cross-examination on each of the bases identified on the appeal, where his evidence was independently supported by extrinsic evidence, where the trial judge gave the jury all the warnings required by law and where discrepancies between his evidence to police and at trial were explicable, it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of Witness A: [355]-[368], [372]-[375] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(xvi)   Despite criticisms that Witness A exhibited paranoid behaviour, there were justifiable reasons for this and no indication of mental instability at the time of the trial. In those circumstances it was open to the jury to accept his evidence: [369]-[371] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Joint trial

(xvii)   No miscarriage of justice occurred where much of the evidence against the co-accused was necessary to establish the context in which the second appellant’s participation in the conspiracy occurred. This factual matrix could not be dealt with by an agreed statement of facts where much of the evidence was controversial: [389]-[391] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(xviii)   Where the risk of inconsistent verdicts, inconvenience to witnesses and substantial delay is high, there is clear public interest in conducting a joint trial which is to be given weight in assessing whether there was a miscarriage of justice: [388], [391], [397] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Ross v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 207 applied

(xix)   Where the evidence that could not be used against the second appellant, namely the admission by the first appellant to Witness B, was readily severable from the rest of the evidence and comprised a very small part of the evidence at trial, any prejudice was easily overcome by directions to the jury: [393]-[394], [396]-[397] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 distinguished

Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 applied

Manifestly excessive sentence

(xx)   In order for the second appellant to show that his sentence was manifestly excessive, it was necessary for him to show that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. It was not sufficient that the appellate court would have exercised its discretion differently: [411] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 254 CLR 259 applied

(xxi)   The sentence was not manifestly excessive where the second appellant’s role in the conspiracy was not found to be minimal. He was a committed and knowing participant in the conspiracy up until the day before the murder. The fact that the second appellant did not play an active role in the murder did not reduce his culpability for the conspiracy offence, rather it affected the charge brought against him: [412]-[414] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Third appellant

Unreasonable verdict

(xxii)   Where the case against the third appellant was circumstantial, concentration on certain parts of the evidence to the exclusion of others was erroneous. When analysed as a whole, there were a number of circumstances that supported the conclusion that the third appellant was involved in the criminal enterprise not only after the death of the deceased but in the preparations leading up to it: [426]-[442] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Directions regarding the first appellant’s plea

(xxiii)   There was no misdirection where the trial judge made it clear to the jury that, in determining the case against the third appellant, it was necessary to consider (a) the existence of the joint criminal enterprise and (b) the third appellant’s participation in it and that it was imperative to consider the cases against each of the appellants separately by reference only to the evidence properly admissible against each of the appellants: [452]-[454] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(xxiv)   To show that the direction regarding the first appellant’s plea led to a miscarriage of justice, it would be necessary to show that there was reasonable doubt as to the substance of that plea, namely that the first appellant was involved in the kidnapping of the deceased: [455] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Admissibility of Ex AA

(xxv)   As Ex AA was admitted without objection, it was admissible irrespective of the provisions of s 106 of the Evidence Act: [475]-[478] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

WC v The Queen [2015] NSWCCA 52 applied

(xxvi)   In any event, s 106 does not require the adoption of a mechanistic approach in which each and every proposition contained in the evidence is put to the witness. The substance of the evidence was put to the witness such as to satisfy s 106 of the Evidence Act: [479]-[480] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Direction regarding matters which could be taken into account

(xxvii)   Evidence which did not directly implicate the third appellant was nevertheless available to prove the nature and scope of the conspiracy: [489] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

(xxviii)   When taken in the context of the summing up as a whole there was no misdirection, particularly where the trial judge repeatedly reminded the jury of the requirement to consider the case against each appellant separately, set out the matters specifically relied upon by the Crown to establish the third appellant’s participation in the conspiracy and directed the jury that establishing the existence of the conspiracy was separate from establishing the third appellant’s participation in it: [490]-[497] (Bathurst CJ, Hoeben CJ at CL and Bellew J).

Crown case and overview of evidence


	
	Anthony Perish and Andrew Perish believed Terrence Falconer (the deceased) murdered their grandparents. They also believed that the deceased was a police informer. To exact revenge, they directed the abduction of the deceased on 16 November 2001. At the time, the deceased was an inmate of Silverwater Prison and had been granted work release which allowed him to leave gaol and travel by train to a smash repair business at Ingleburn.
	
	
	Evidence of the events, the subject of the charges, was primarily given by witnesses who were criminally involved. A number of these witnesses were identified by pseudonyms – “Witness A” through to “Witness H”.
	
	
	On 16 November 2001 three men, Witness E, Witness H and Craig Bottin (Bottin) attended the smash repair business at Ingleburn where the deceased was working. They impersonated police officers and purported to arrest the deceased, handcuffing him and placing him in Witness E’s vehicle. The wheels of the vehicle had been modified so as to appear consistent with an undercover police vehicle. The vehicle was driven to a nearby location during the course of which the deceased was subdued using Chloroform or some other agent.
	
	
	Upon reaching that location (referred to at trial as “the grassy embankment”) the deceased was transferred unconscious from Witness E’s vehicle to a metal box and placed in a van. Witness E then drove the deceased in the metal box from that location to Anthony Perish’s residence in North Turramurra. It was not clear whether the deceased was dead by the time he arrived at Turramurra. Witness E said that he was met by Anthony Perish on his arrival at the residence at North Turramurra. He said that the metal box was opened and the deceased attempted to get up. He said that he and Anthony Perish assaulted the deceased and the box was closed again.
	
	
	Witness E, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, using two separate vehicles, drove with the box from North Turramurra to a property at Girvan to which Anthony Perish had access. By that time, the deceased was dead. The van was never located. At Girvan the body of the deceased was dismembered using saws and wrapped up for disposal.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that preparations had been made in advance to destroy the deceased’s corpse. A block and tackle was ready from which to suspend the body. Plastic sheeting was available and rolled out to cover the floor. Saws and other tools were on hand and chemicals were ready to clean the crime scene. Anthony Perish, Matthew Lawton and Witness E then cut up the deceased’s body and parcelled it into seven separate packages which were wrapped in chicken wire and weighted with stones.
	
	
	It was the Crown case that Anthony Perish and Andrew Perish had initially made plans to dump the body parts at sea. When those plans were frustrated, Anthony Perish disposed of the remains in the Hastings River. Six of the seven parcels washed ashore in various places along the Hastings River. The human remains in the packages were examined and sufficient fingerprint detail was found to identify the remains as those of the deceased. Some time later a resident living near the Hastings River found another package wrapped in blue plastic and bound using wire and duct tape. That package also contained human remains, later identified as belonging to the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown case was that Anthony Perish, seeking vengeance, meticulously planned and co-ordinated the kidnapping and murder of the deceased. The Crown case was that irrespective of when and how the deceased died, Anthony Perish was guilty of his murder because he always intended that the deceased would die. The Crown relied on evidence of motive, means and opportunity given by three participants in the conspiracy to abduct and murder the deceased. The Crown also relied upon an admission subsequently made by Anthony Perish to a family member that “we killed him … killed Falconer” and forensic evidence from the North Coast crime scene.
	
	
	At trial Anthony Perish accepted that he was responsible for some of the acts of Witness E. He admitted that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise to abduct the deceased. He asserted that the plan was only to abduct and question the deceased. He agreed that he foresaw the possibility that Witness E might use force resulting in the infliction of injury to the deceased that ultimately caused his death.
	


Factual background in further detail


	
	On 16 June 1993 the grandparents of Anthony and Andrew Perish were found murdered in their home at Leppington. There was evidence that Andrew Perish became extremely upset when he arrived at the home, screaming and crying. Despite inquests in 1997 and 2002, the murders remain unsolved. A number of people were considered as potential suspects: their son, Albert; their daughter, Elana; a solicitor named Justin Birk Hill; their granddaughter, Colleen; and a woman called Wendy Stott.
	
	
	The first time the deceased’s name was raised was on 15 March 2004 when an anonymous caller telephoned Burwood Police Station and claimed to a detective that the deceased had murdered the Perish grandparents. There was other evidence that the deceased had some involvement in the deaths. Police also received information that Robert Institoris and Witness A, who were both from the Rebels Motorcycle Club, had nominated the deceased as having been involved.
	
	
	The police position in early 2001 was that there were rumours that the deceased was involved in the murder of the grandparents but there was no hard evidence. In early 2001 Anthony Perish recruited Witness E to investigate the murder of his grandparents.
	
	
	Witness B had married into the Perish family. His brother-in-law was a serving NSW police officer. In March 2001 he had dinner with Anthony Perish who asked him to obtain some police uniforms for him. He did not ask Anthony Perish why and Anthony Perish did not tell him. Anthony Perish had not made such a request previously. About a month later Anthony Perish asked Witness B whether he had approached his brother-in-law about the police uniforms to which Witness B responded “Yeah, but he wouldn’t do it”. In fact Witness B never made the request to his brother-in-law.
	
	
	Detective Inspector Bryne Ruse was a member of the strike force investigating the murder of the Perish grandparents. He was approached by Andrew Perish in June 2001 about the investigation. Thereafter he spoke to Andrew Perish on a number of occasions during which Andrew Perish expressed dissatisfaction with the investigation and suggested that there might have been a cover up by the police. Andrew Perish told Inspector Ruse that he had received information that the deceased admitted to two employees of a motor vehicle wrecker in Sydney that he had murdered the grandparents. Inspector Ruse spoke to the deceased’s wife, who claimed to have some information from her daughter’s boyfriend, Robert Institoris, that the deceased was involved in the murder of the grandparents. When Inspector Ruse spoke to the deceased, who was then in gaol, he denied the allegation and said that his wife wanted to keep him in gaol so that she could steal from him and that they were involved in a property dispute.
	
	
	The deceased’s former wife gave evidence that in the 12 months before his death she and the deceased were estranged. Her evidence was as follows. In 1996 the deceased gave her his brief of evidence which set out the assistance which he was prepared to give to police in respect of the Rebels Motorcycle Club and their drug activities. In 2001 she showed that document to a number of people, including Andrew Perish. She did this because the deceased was putting it around that she was informing on the Rebels. When she showed the document to Andrew Perish, he appeared to read it. She did not think he took it with him.
	
	
	In cross-examination she agreed that when she gave evidence before the Crime Commission in 2002, she had said nothing about speaking to Andrew Perish at this time. She had lied to the Crime Commission because she did not want to bring Andrew into it and did not want him to think that she was an informer. She did not tell the police about meeting with Andrew Perish until November 2006.
	


Witness A


	
	Witness A had a nickname “Nosey”. Except where otherwise indicated, the following evidence was given by Witness A. He was a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club and had been since 1991. Andrew Perish had become a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club some time after him. Anthony Perish was not a member of the Club but was associated with it.
	
	
	In October 2001 a woman named Denise (Matthew Lawton’s wife) arrived at the home he shared with his then girlfriend (Witness F). Denise told him “I got a message from our mate”. When Witness A said “Who?”, she said “Rooster” which was a nickname of Anthony Perish. She handed Witness A $1,000 and told him to buy some decent clothes to wear out to dinner. She said that Andrew Perish would come and see him in a couple of days. Her arrival on that day was unexpected.
	
	
	Witness F gave evidence at trial. At the time she gave evidence she was experiencing health problems and was taking a number of medications that slowed her down and adversely affected her memory. She had been in a relationship with Witness A ten years before, for about two years. When she gave her statement to police in 2009, she did not have medical problems and her memory was better. She knew Denise, who had visited her on a couple of occasions. In cross-examination she said that Witness A had not told her that Denise had given money to him. She had no knowledge of Denise delivering money to him.
	
	
	Between two and four days later Andrew Perish arrived in the morning in a maroon and grey Toyota Surf motor vehicle. He said that he would return around 7pm because they were going to dinner with “our mate”. A Roads and Traffic Authority certificate of registration confirmed that a maroon Toyota Surf motor vehicle WPE 089 was registered in the name of Andrew Perish at that time. Andrew Perish returned that evening at around 7pm and drove Witness A to a suburb that he said was Newtown. After they met Anthony Perish, the three men went to a restaurant and had dinner.
	
	
	During the dinner Anthony Perish said “So Nosey, what can you do for the company?” Witness A said, “What would the company have me do for them?”. Anthony Perish said, “You’ve got a boat?” Witness A said that he did but it needed repairs. Anthony Perish said “If the boat was fixed, would it make it out to the shelf and back?”. Witness A told him that it would and that he would be able to captain it. Witness A took “the shelf” to mean the Continental Shelf. There was a discussion about the cost of repairs and Anthony Perish asked whether if he gave Witness A a couple of grand tomorrow, he would put the boat in to be fixed. Witness A said that he would. Andrew Perish was present during the entire conversation.
	
	
	Anthony then asked Andrew if he [Andrew] could give Witness A the couple of grand on the way home and Andrew said he could. Anthony Perish said to Witness A, “I want you to put the boat in – come up the Karuah River to Bulahdelah. There’s a wharf up there. Come up to the wharf and I’ll be waiting for you just like a fisherman with a couple of eskys because the cunt might be in a few pieces.” Witness A said that there would be people everywhere and Anthony said “Mate, nobody will know any different, we’ll just look like a couple of fisherman going out for a day’s fishing”. Witness A asked who it was that would be killed and Anthony said “Don’t worry, it’s no-one in the club”. Witness A said “Who is the cunt?” and Anthony said, “Don’t worry, it’s not you”.
	
	
	Anthony Perish told Witness A that he would be paid $20,000 for the job. Witness A did not say anything but “Just looked at him” and Anthony sat back in his chair and said, “Tell you what, I’ll pay you thirty grand”. Witness A said “Half up front and half when the job’s done” and Anthony said “No, no, no, I don’t work like that”. Witness A said “Well you pay me half up front and I’ll incur the expenses”. Anthony said “No, I don’t work like that. We’ll give you money for your expenses”. Anthony Perish told Witness A that someone would drop off a mobile phone to him the next day. He mentioned a name but Witness A did not recognise it. He asked who it was and Anthony said it was the same person that drove the truck down to Adelaide when Witness A and his then partner Nicole moved to Adelaide.
	
	
	Exhibit E was a large laminated map showing areas of the Central Coast, including Bulahdelah and Girvan and numbered photographs of boat ramps along the river systems. Anthony Perish had access to a property at 158 Brooks Road, Girvan where the deceased was dismembered. Girvan is approximately 10 kms from the Karuah River and 20 kms from Bulahdelah.
	
	
	Witness A had met the deceased once in his life in 1999 in the visitors’ section of the Remand Centre at Long Bay when they were both in custody. Witness A knew him by face and knew that he was in another bike club. They said hello and spoke about the deceased’s daughter going out with Rob Institoris whom Witness A knew was in the Rebels Motorcycle Club. The topic turned to the Perish family and Witness A said, “I heard you killed the Perish grandparents”. The deceased said, “Yeah, I heard that one too”.
	
	
	During the dinner with Anthony and Andrew Perish, Anthony told Witness A that he knew that the deceased had told him while they were in gaol that he had killed the grandparents. Witness A responded that he had a mobile phone in gaol and that if he had been given that information, Anthony would have known straight away. Anthony thought about it for a minute and said “Yeah, I guess”. Witness A asked who had told him this and Anthony said “We got a phone call from Liz (the deceased’s wife); it was she who said it”. (When asked in the year 2001 whether he had had any contact, either direct or indirect, with the deceased’s wife Witness A answered “Never met the woman, no”.)
	
	
	During small talk at the restaurant the name “Perry” was mentioned. Witness A asked Anthony Perish “Do you still see Perry?” to which Anthony replied “No, I don’t like the cunt any more”. When the three men left the restaurant Witness A accompanied Andrew Perish to his home where Andrew gave him $2,000 in cash for the repairs to the boat. Andrew Perish then drove Witness A home.
	
	
	The following morning Witness A took his boat to Marine Scene at Campbelltown for repairs. Exhibit S was the service repair order from Marine Scene showing that the boat was received for repair on 12 October 2001 and a deposit paid on 19 October 2001. Witness A was subsequently advised that the cost of replacing one of the motors would be about $4,000 in addition to the $2,000 he had been given after dinner. After he received the quote, he contacted Andrew Perish who said “Just get it done” and agreed to pay the necessary amount. Andrew Perish provided further funding during October in order for the boat to be seaworthy.
	
	
	Telephone records established various contacts between Witness A and Andrew Perish during October 2001. On 9 October 2001 Witness A’s phone, Mobile 1, called Andrew Perish’s phone four times between 3.12.59 and 3.14.28 but the calls were diverted. One call at 3.20.39 was answered and there was a conversation for 88 seconds. On the same date, Witness A’s phone, Mobile 2, called Andrew Perish’s phone at 14.08.38, 14.33.01 and 18.57.12 and those calls were diverted. Mobile 2 sent a text message to Andrew Perish’s phone at 18.58.39. On 10 October 2001 Andrew Perish phoned Witness A’s Mobile 1 at 1.05.36 and that call was diverted. At 1.06.23 Andrew Perish phoned Witness A’s Mobile 2 and that call was also diverted. On 11 October 2001 Mobile 2 rang Andrew Perish at 21.11.49 and that call was diverted. On 12 October 2001 Mobile 2 rang Andrew Perish at 15.15.02 and that call was diverted. On 25 October 2001 there was a Mobile 2 text message to Andrew Perish. On 26 October 2001 there was a Mobile 2 text message to Andrew Perish and two calls to him. There were two text messages from Andrew Perish to Mobile 2 on that day. On 27 October 2001 there was a Mobile 2 text message to Andrew Perish. On 28 October 2001 there were three Mobile 2 texts to Andrew Perish and one call. There were four texts from Andrew Perish to Mobile 2 and one call to Mobile 2.
	
	
	A few days after the meeting at the restaurant, Matthew Lawton arrived at Witness A’s home in a white EL utility Ford and gave him a mobile phone. He told Witness A “This is the phone from Steve” (Steve was one of the nicknames of Anthony Perish). Witness A said “Who?” and he said, “Rooster”. He also said “Keep it on and charged and don’t use it for anything other than contacting each other”. At that time, Witness A did not know Matthew Lawton’s name but recognised him as the man who had driven him to Adelaide. The phone handset was a Motorola Talkabout model and came with a prepaid Optus SIM card, subscribed in the name “McDowell”.
	
	
	Witness F said that Witness A did not tell her about a man delivering a mobile phone to him. Witness A did not tell police until his ninth meeting with them on 4 October 2002 that it was Matthew Lawton who had delivered the mobile phone to him. The mobile phone in the name of John McDowell was activated on 29 October 2001 at 14.52.42. On 29 October 2001 at 9.22.15 Andrew Perish rang Witness A’s Mobile 2 and spoke for 30 seconds. Following the activation of the McDowell mobile, the Andrew Perish number did not initiate contact with Mobile 1 or Mobile 2 until 14 November 2001.
	
	
	Although Matthew Lawton gave Witness A instructions not to use the McDowell phone to contact anyone other than Anthony and Andrew Perish, Witness A did not follow those instructions and used the phone to call Marine Scene, his home phone and possibly other numbers. He did this so as to “leave a traceable trail” because he had no intention of carrying out the job. At this time he believed that he was either being set up or lined up to be killed himself.
	
	
	Whereas phone records for the McDowell phone could record outward calls, there were no charge records recording incoming calls for the McDowell phone.
	
	
	Subsequent to the dinner meeting, Anthony Perish came to Witness A’s home on three or four occasions. On the first occasion between 6 and 10 days after the boat was taken to Marine Scene for repairs, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton visited Witness A to check on the progress of the boat. Matthew Lawton was driving the same white EL Ford utility as when he delivered the phone. Witness A was not expecting them so when they arrived he started recording from the security camera which he had installed just after the phone was dropped off. To the best of his recollection, they had a conversation next to the car, near the front door of his house. Matthew Lawton was present during the discussion between Witness A and Anthony Perish in respect of the progress of the repairs to the boat. Witness F knew that Witness A had a security camera on the gate, but had never seen any of the videos he made of people coming to see him. She did not recall accidentally taping over any videos of people coming to see him, nor that he was angry that she had taped over the videos. Witness A gave evidence that the reason why he did not have a video of each visit to him by Anthony Perish was because Witness F had accidentally taped over those videos.
	
	
	Possibly within a week of the dinner with Anthony and Andrew Perish, Witness A took a trip to Newcastle with Witness F. His destination was Salamander Bay because it had a boat ramp next to the pub that was not too close or too far away from Bulahdelah. On the way he stopped at the Waterways office in Newcastle and requested a duplicate set of papers for the boat which was registered in Witness F’s name. He also picked up four maps of the surrounding waterways and areas of Newcastle, Salamander Bay and Myall Lakes. He attended the Newcastle Waterways office to assist him in leaving a trail. He believed that the boat was still at Marine Scene being worked on at this time. He did not take the boat with him.
	
	
	Witness F said that at the time she and Witness A separated just before Christmas 2001, they had plans to go away in the boat, up near Newcastle. Witness A had taken the trip. She did not know if he had gone alone but she knew he had met a woman up there. She did not remember taking an overnight trip with him in the months leading up to their separation. The only occasion that she could remember them being on the boat was on the Nepean River at Penrith. She had never been to Soldiers Point, Soldiers Bay or Salamander Bay on the Central Coast.
	
	
	Witness F said that Witness A went “to see a bloke that lived by himself on an island. Around this time he did go up to the Newcastle area with the boat and a girl called Annie from Minchinbury on a holiday”. Witness F did not go because they had been having arguments. Witness A was still living with her at the time he took the trip with Annie. Witness F did not recall the boat being away from the house for a couple of weeks to be repaired.
	
	
	After the stop at the Waterways office in Newcastle, he and Witness F continued up to Salamander Bay. They stayed overnight at the Salamander Shores Hotel. Exhibit R was the receipt from the Salamander Shores Hotel dated 31 October 2001. They returned to Sydney the next day. During that period of traveling and staying overnight Anthony Perish rang Witness A on the McDowell phone and they spoke about the reconnaissance of the waterways.
	
	
	Telephone records (Exhibit HH) showed calls made by Mobiles 1 & 2 on 31 October 2001 and 1 November 2001 being picked up by communications towers at Narong, Glovers Hill, Nelson Bay and Rydalmere. On 1 November 2001 (at 18.45.52) and on 2 November (15.47.54) Mobile 2 sent text messages to Andrew Perish’s mobile phone. Cell tower locations are not available for text messages.
	
	
	Witness A marked the map of Port Stephens with a line from the Salamander Bay Hotel pointing up through the Karuah River, an “X” at Tea Gardens and an “X” at Jimmy’s Beach. On the second last visit from Anthony Perish, he and Witness A discussed the Karuah River and the information Witness A had found out about that river including depth, speed restrictions and police presence. They were standing in the boat as they discussed this. Witness A complained that there were too many police and speed restrictions. Anthony said, “What about here?” while pointing to Tea Gardens on the map, so Witness A put an “X” at Tea Gardens. Witness A made the other markings during the discussion. The boat ramp at Salamander Bay was where the boat was going to be put in. Witness A eliminated Bulahdelah because of information he had received that there was a four or five knot speed restriction throughout the river.
	
	
	It was common ground that there was no connection between the Hastings River and the Bulahdelah River or the Myall River. To get to the Bulahdelah River, one would go up the Myall River and the Bulahdelah River ran off it. The Myall River was in a different river system to the Karuah River, although they had the same inlet, Port Stephens.
	
	
	Witness A saw Andrew Perish a number of times after the Newtown dinner. He saw him at his [Witness A’s] home on more than three occasions. He remembered two specific instances that he saw Andrew Perish at other places - once at the Rossmore shops on Bringelly Road and the other was at Dan Perish’s place. The occasion at Bringelly was not a planned meeting.
	
	
	The recollection of Witness A was that the total for the repairs to the boat was around $5,000. There were other expenses incurred as a result of the trip to Salamander Bay. After he spoke to Andrew Perish and indicated that the repairs involved a greater sum of money, Andrew told him to go ahead with the job. Arrangements were made for Witness A to pick up some money from Dan Perish’s (Andrew’s brother’s) place at Rossmore. His memory was that Andrew picked him up from his house and drove him there, where he was given $3,000 to cover the cost of all the necessary repairs to the boat. Andrew then drove him home. On another occasion Andrew Perish gave Witness A $1,500 to cover expenses. The amounts were clarified to be: $2,000 from Andrew at his house at Eagle Vale; $1,500 from Andrew at the property at Greendale; $3,000 from Andrew at his brother’s place; and $1,800 from Anthony Perish for expenses at the second last meeting at Witness A’s house.
	
	
	On the second last visit by Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton (which was either the second or third visit) Anthony Perish handed Witness A a police document or what seemed to be a police document with the deceased’s name on it. It stated that the deceased was prepared to give evidence to the Crime Commission against the Rebels Motorcycle Club in Dubbo in relation to their drug dealing. Matthew Lawton was present when Witness A was handed the document. Witness A was standing between the front seat and the open door of the white utility. Anthony Perish was standing right next to the seat. Matthew Lawton was sitting in the driver’s seat.
	
	
	Witness A was shown a document during his evidence in chief. He did not think it was the same document that Anthony Perish had shown him but the content of paragraph three said the same thing, “Not in those words but pretty much what it said”.
	
	
	On the last visit by Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton to the home of Witness A, there was discussion about the boat being ready. Witness A said it had to be “run in”. Anthony Perish said to him “Get on with it” and “Hurry up because this cunt goes this Friday regardless”. This last visit was on a Friday and the deceased went missing the following Friday. Each of the visits was recorded by Witness A using the surveillance system that he had installed. He had a recording of the last visit but did not know what happened to the other tape recordings. Exhibit N was the video recording of the last visit. There was no audio. Witness A said that it was when he and Anthony Perish walked away from the car that Anthony Perish said “This cunt’s going this Friday regardless”. Exhibit N showed Witness A and Anthony Perish walk to the gate. At the gate Anthony Perish said:
	


“You’ll come up, you’ll pick up a couple of eskys, you’ll go out and take them out to the continental shelf, you will empty out the contents over a big hole using a depth sounder. On the way back wash those eskys out half way back and throw them over the side. When you get back, wash the boat out with ammonia.”

Witness A said: ‘Huh?’

Anthony Perish said: ‘If you wash it out with ammonia they can tell there’s been blood in the boat but they can’t tell whose it is. It fucks the DNA.’”


	
	Witness A raised with Anthony Perish that the plan seemed to have changed to him going out by himself. He said “What, you’re not coming with me?” Anthony said “Nah, that’s what I’m paying you for”. It was also at the gate that Anthony Perish said “Hurry up, this cunt’s going this Friday no matter what”.
	
	
	Witness A did not recall any discussion before Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton left about whether there would be any further contact connected with the plan in the following days. There was in fact no further contact after the last meeting. Witness A switched off the McDowell phone after the last visit by Anthony Perish on the Friday.
	
	
	Phone records (Exhibit HH) show that Andrew Perish’s phone called Witness A’s Mobile 2 phone on 14 November 2001 (the Wednesday before the deceased was abducted) at 19.27.21, 19.39.41 and 19.46.44 and on each occasion was diverted to voicemail. On 15 November 2001 Andrew Perish’s phone called Witness A’s Mobile 2 at 9.57.34 and 9.58.56 and each call was diverted to voicemail. The McDowell phone was used daily to make calls until Tuesday, 12 November 2001. There was then a gap of eight days when no calls were made until Tuesday, 20 November 2001.
	
	
	Witness A did not participate in the disposal of the remains of the deceased and never had any intention of doing so. He confirmed that on each occasion that Anthony Perish attended his house in relation to the boat, Matthew Lawton was the driver. He said it was “quite possible” that Lawton spoke to him about the boat, but he could not recall. Matthew Lawton was present during conversations between Witness A and Anthony Perish about the boat and was present when Anthony Perish gave him the police document to read.
	
	
	Before his reconnaissance in the Salamander Bay region, Witness A had been there many times, the last time having been around 1982 when he went fishing with his father. He had never heard of Girvan until after the deceased’s death.
	
	
	Witness A learned of the abduction of the deceased from the news media on the Saturday after he was abducted. On the morning of Thursday, 29 August 2002 police knocked on his door and told him that they were investigating the murder of the deceased. Between the time he last saw Anthony Perish and the police arriving on 29 August 2002, Witness A did not approach police or any other authority and indicate his knowledge in relation to the matter.
	
	
	The police note (Inspector Jubelin) in relation to 29 August 2002 stated: “[Witness A] stated that Steve Perish had approached him after his release and he believes without ever being told specifically, tried to recruit him to participate in some way in the murder of Terry Falconer and/or the disposal of his remains”.
	
	
	When the police arrived on 29 August 2002 Witness A indicated to them that he might have some information. During the course of his assistance to police, he agreed to speak to Andrew Perish while wearing a listening device. One occasion when he participated in this procedure was at Andrew Perish’s place of work at Camden on 30 September 2002. He explained the contents of that conversation. When he said, “Don’t need this shit mate, that’s why I pulled out of the fuckin’ job in the first place”, he was referring to the disposal of the deceased’s body. When he said “and sort the fuckin’ money out too, all right” he was referring to the $8,300 that had been paid to him. During the recorded conversation Witness A asked Andrew Perish what he should say to police. Andrew Perish said “They’re not going to want you to say nothing about knocking the other thing”. When he said “I’m not a weak cunt mate. It’s just things weren’t right, I was fresh out of gaol”, he was referring to having been released from gaol in 2001. “I need to know that fuckin’ piece of paper you showed me about Terry Falconer is gone because it’s got my fuckin’ prints on it” referring to the document Anthony Perish had shown him on the second last visit. Andrew Perish had answered “It’s gone mate, don’t worry”.
	
	
	On 1 October 2002 Camden police provided Witness A with the sum of $1,000 to give to Andrew Perish in part repayment for moneys pertaining to the boat. Witness A attended Andrew Perish’s business premises in Camden and had a conversation with him that was recorded by a listening device (Exhibit U). Witness A gave Andrew Perish the $1,000 and asked “Do I have to pay the whole eight and a half or just fuckin’ … ‘cause I don’t really wanna fuckin’ put a new motor on the boat” which referred to the money he had been paid in preparation for disposing of the body.
	
	
	On 16 October 2002 Witness A again engaged Andrew Perish in conversation in Camden, while wired with a recording device (Exhibit V). At the time there was background noise of a compressor on one of the fridges. Witness A gave evidence that Andrew said in a whisper “Nosey, Nosey, nobody knows we done it”. Witness A believed this should have been recorded in the transcript of the conversation at p 5, 1.30.15 “where it commences”. He could not recall what he had said to elicit that answer. The words “Nosey, Nosey, nobody knows we done it” are not recorded in the transcript.
	
	
	Exhibit X was the recorded conversation between Witness A and Andrew Perish on 17 November 2002 at premises at Camden. In that conversation Witness A referred to the job involving the disposal of the deceased’s body. Later in the conversation, Witness A continued to tell Andrew Perish that he did not want any part of it and for Andrew to sort it out. At p 9 of the transcript, Witness A said “Remember the conversation we had? At the back of the place? And you said nobody knows who done it?” Perish said “Yeah”. Witness A said “Fuckin’ everybody knows who done it”. Here Witness A was referring to the conversation of 16 October 2002, which was not audible.
	
	
	At pp 18-19 of the transcript, Witness A said “Listen Frank’s also the one who told me that you called me a weak cunt because I didn’t go through with the job for ya. So you go fuckin’ talk to Frank. That’s why I came down the fuckin’ track that night”. Andrew Perish said “That cunt likes to cause as much trouble as he can that cunt”. Later Witness A said “Well that’s Frank, the photos are Frank’s because he told me you were setting me up. I see you with Perry?” Andrew Perish said “But that’s not the case I’m not fuckin’ … ”. Witness A said “You’ve always trusted me yeah?” and Perish said “Yeah we fuckin’ do, mate”.
	
	
	In cross-examination Witness A was not able to remember the name of the restaurant where he had dinner with Anthony and Andrew Perish. He said that when the police spoke to him on 29 August 2002 they said “we’ve got nothing, anything you know or anything you can tell us?” and he said “It just so happens I can tell you who, where, when, how. If you meet me at another address tonight I will take it from there”.
	
	
	He agreed that in late 1996 and again in 1997 he had gone to the NSW Crime Commission as a result of a warrant he requested to be activated. He had given the Crime Commission information, his aim being to get bail so he could prove that he was not guilty of the offence for which he was incarcerated. He had not seen Detective Browne’s investigator’s notes about the detectives’ meetings with him. He had communicated with Detective Browne “dozens and dozens of times”. On some occasions he thought that the police were watching him with helicopters and had taken photographs of helicopters. He thought that one helicopter looked like a police helicopter with no markings on it and it seemed to be carrying a camera. He had contacted police when he observed four Jatz crackers in the swimming pool at his home which he believed indicated that somebody had been in his yard while he was asleep and put them in the pool.
	
	
	There was an instance when a man had walked into a shop with a golf club in his hand with the word “Hush” written on the cover. The man had handed the golf club to the attendant behind the counter and asked her to look after it and then drove off. Witness A believed that this was a message to him to “Shut the fuck up”, and that he “was talking to the wrong people”. He further reported a break-in by individuals who were using a car with the licence plate HSV-DNA which he believed indicated there was a plan to collect his DNA.
	
	
	There was a period when he did not trust the police. He made two phone calls to police and mentioned in those calls that he was going to Channel 9. It was after those calls that the incident with the Hush golf putter took place. He went to Channel 9 and later Channel 7 because he wanted someone other than the police to know what was going on. At the time he did not trust the police “full stop”. As far as he knew, three police officers had abducted the deceased, who was later found in bags, allegedly killed by police. He believed that the police wanted him dead so he wanted a third party to know what was going on.
	
	
	He was in a state of “hyper-vigilance from the word go; not distressed. I was hyper-vigilant, yes”. He believed that a lot of suspicious things had happened “a lot of things happened in that highly stressed environment. It may or may not have been what I thought at the time, but it happened”. It was his belief at the time that he was being set up. He did not trust the police and did not think that they were being honest with him “when this first started”.
	
	
	He did not try to deceive police when he was speaking to them, but he did hold things back. What he told them was true. They came to his door and “it was a split second decision to give them the video” and to tell them what he knew, because he “never had any intention of going through with any job”. He had not approached police because initially he believed that he was the target. He was never told that the deceased was the one that was going to be killed. Although he was suspicious of the police, he was talking to them because he “needed to know what the hell was going on”.
	
	
	He made his statement to police in a secure location over four days for a number of hours each day. Police then took away their computers, printed it out and gave him a copy. He declined to sign it at that stage. He made some adjustments to it and signed it at another time. His belief was that if he were not the target, he was going to be set up with somebody else’s murder. He denied he was called “Nosey” because he made up stories about people. He had acquired his nickname in 1985-1986 when he used to ride in a different motorcycle club. When he saw members talking, he would go over and say “What’s going on, what’s happening?” He was often told “Piss off you nosey bastard”. He said that the nickname suggested that he was a “sticky beak”. It did not suggest that he was a gossip.
	
	
	He agreed that he was seriously injured when stabbed seven times while in custody at Lithgow before he was released to parole in 2001. After he was released, he had grave fears for his safety if he went back to gaol because of the information he had supplied to the Crime Commission about the Rebels. He was on parole at the time police knocked on his door and remained on parole during the time he assisted police.
	
	
	He had taken amphetamines over the years. He may have had a cone of marijuana to help him sleep when he was stressed during the investigation. He agreed with the proposition that “giving amphetamines a decent going over” could make him paranoid. In conversation with the police, he recalled the word “paranoid” being used on occasions. When asked if he thought he had been paranoid he said, “Well if I was, I was still alive and if I was paranoid and didn’t see what I thought I saw, that’s okay with me, I’m here today”.
	
	
	He had never before worn a listening device. Straight after he heard the confession from Andrew Perish, he sent a text message to police. He believed the confession had been captured on the tape. When he was asked where it had gone, he said “Behind the compressor or noises”. He had heard it; he could not explain the recording equipment. He said, “I know when it took place and I believe I can hear the whisper, but I can’t explain it for you, or anyone else’s hearing. I was there and I know it was said”. Witness A said:
	


“I believe I said that at one stage, that I had listened to the recording, what I believed was the original recording, and I believe I can hear it. I know what conversation took place before and after and I also know where we were sitting and how it was said. It was said in a whisper and it was covered by the sound of the compressor. That’s all I can say.”


	
	He had been found guilty of murder at trial and had successfully appealed his conviction. After his conviction was overturned, he had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that he had been present at the scene.
	
	
	At the time that he was giving evidence at trial he had a new identity and had been relocated, partly as a result of the investigation of the murder of the deceased. When asked if police had assisted him, he said he had changed his name legally and requested where he wanted to go. After he went to the Crime Commission in 1997 an anonymous letter was sent to the gaol, so he was moved to Goulburn. Another anonymous letter was sent to the effect that he was going to be killed there, so he was moved back to Long Bay. He was in Lithgow Gaol when he was attacked and stabbed seven times and seriously injured.
	
	
	He could not remember exactly when he put the cameras up at his home, but it was after the McDowell phone was dropped off at Bringelly. He denied that he was making up the evidence as he went along. He said, “It’s been ten years … I can’t be perfect”. What was in his statement was the truth; and the reason he did not recall bits and pieces was because he had not learned it word for word. He did not read his statement every day. He just wanted to forget the whole incident. He was able to distinguish the second last meeting from the last meeting because the video did not show a document handed to him at the car, did not show them hop in the boat and the boat did not shake.
	
	
	The video depicted the last time Anthony Perish came to his house on 9 November 2001. Watching the video refreshed his memory that on that occasion he and Anthony Perish did not get into the boat and look at maps. At no time did he tell Anthony Perish that he was not going to go through with the job. He was just “running in parallel with them and seeing what happens”. He was doing everything he could to delay the matter while trying to find out what was going on. When he asked at the Newtown dinner “Who is the cunt?”, he was told it was none of his business. At the last meeting, the plans had changed from “we” to just him [Witness A] taking the boat up so he decided he was not the one who would be killed, but that he was possibly being set up. He thought that having his prints on the document about the deceased was part of the set up.
	


Detective Browne


	
	Detective Browne spoke to Witness A for the first time on 29 August 2002. He gave the following evidence. Initially police had some information from Corrective Services that suggested that Witness A may have had some involvement with the deceased. He was accompanied by Detective Rankin and they arrived at Witness A’s house just before midday. Witness A took them around the side of the house where they had a conversation. They told Witness A that they were there to speak to him regarding the murder of the deceased. Witness A asked “Where do I fit in?” Detective Rankin said “Do you know Terry Falconer?” and Witness A said “Look, I know who did it, and I know why they did it, but I don’t know if I should be telling you”. He told them to come back at 8pm, just the two of them, and not to tell anyone. He gave them a different address to attend that night.
	
	
	Detectives Browne and Rankin met Witness A that night at the new address. He took them to a small flat at the back of the house where they had a discussion. Not long into the discussion Witness A produced a video (Exhibit N) and played it for them. Thereafter Detective Browne had meetings with Witness A in various discreet locations during the day and night. Police did not know what he was going to tell them so they just let him speak. On some occasions, Detective Browne took notes but on other occasions it was not possible to do so at the time. When police first spoke to Witness A, he was very much against giving a statement and it took some time to get him to agree to the listening device operation.
	
	
	When Witness A played the video (Exhibit N), he said that on that occasion ‘Steve’ Perish (i.e. Anthony) handed him a police running sheet that indicated that the deceased was a police informant and had stated to police that he was prepared to assist them and provide information regarding the Rebels at Dubbo and their involvement in the manufacturing of amphetamines. He had recorded in his notes that at the dinner at Newtown, ‘Steve’ asked Witness A “Did Terry Falconer tell you that he killed our grandparents? Liz Falconer told us that Terry told you in gaol he killed my grandparents”. Witness A told Detective Browne that “he had never had this conversation and believed it was caused by Liz Falconer causing trouble as she was a conniving bitch”. He recorded in his notes the next day that Witness A told him that “Steve and Andrew had maps of Newcastle to Bulahdelah area”.
	


Inspector Jubelin


	
	Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin was the officer in charge of the investigation from 2 December 2001 until November 2004 when he left the Homicide Squad, after which Detective Browne was the officer in charge. He first met Witness A on 6 September 2002. Except where otherwise indicated, his evidence was as follows. Witness A had met with Detectives Browne and Rankin on two previous occasions. Witness A had not yet made a statement but had provided information. During this first meeting, Inspector Jubelin raised with him the possibility of meeting with the persons of interest while wearing a listening device. On 25 September 2002 Witness A agreed to do so. There were two benefits to this operation. One was to establish if Witness A was being truthful and the second was to gather additional information and corroborative evidence. Certain details were withheld from Witness A to protect the integrity of the investigation and also police methodology. Specifically, Inspector Jubelin did not disclose the malfunction of the listening device to Witness A as it would have been detrimental to future operations because Witness A had participated at what he considered significant risk and the police had let him down with the failure of the technical equipment.
	
	
	The first recorded conversation took place on 30 September 2002 and the second on 1 October 2002 when Witness A was provided with $1,000, which was to obtain corroboration from Andrew Perish that Witness A had received money in relation to his boat. The poor quality of the recording of 16 October 2002 was because the primary device placed on Witness A, which was to provide the best quality recording, failed very early in the operation. It stopped recording and did not restart. The second device was a back-up device. Witness A was never told that the device had failed and still did not know. Inspector Jubelin was aware that Witness A believed that the quality was impaired due to the background noise of a compressor or refrigerator. Inspector Jubelin had listened to the tape alone and with Witness A and was unable to hear the words that Witness A asserted were said. Police endeavoured to enhance the quality of the tape but that was unsuccessful.
	
	
	After November 2003 Witness A was treated as a witness and not involved in the investigation. He “got on with his life” and there was very limited contact between him and police for about four years.
	
	
	In about July 2003 Inspector Jubelin’s assessment of Witness A was that he was under extreme stress. Inspector Jubelin said:
	


“He had broken a code; a code that he had been living by since he was about 14, and that code I am referring to relates to dealings and assisting police. He had not only assisted the police, which was breaking the code in which he was living, but he had participated in listening device operations and probably worse still, in his mind, he had signed a statement to police in regards to a serious criminal matter. I am not a medical person, but from my observation of him at the time, I thought that he was a person on the verge of a nervous breakdown and for that reason, I thought it appropriate, and so did the then Homicide Superintendent, decide that we make available to him the services of a psychiatrist.”


	
	In 2003 police provided money and helped facilitate Witness A’s relocation. He was provided with a new identity and this was done at the State’s expense. It was mainly Inspector Jubelin and Detective Browne who met with Witness A. The meetings with Witness A were covert so they did not take notes while he was speaking and did not tape record the conversations. They made the notes as contemporaneously as they could and worked off their recollection.
	
	
	Witness A gave Inspector Jubelin information that while he was in gaol Rob Institoris told him that the deceased was going to the Crime Commission to tell them everything he knew about everyone. Witness A believed Liz Falconer became aware of this and rang Anthony Perish and told him. Inspector Jubelin knew that Rob Institoris was married to the deceased’s daughter Linda, and the boat the subject of the investigation had been owned by Institoris. It had been transferred to Witness A because Institoris was indebted to him, because Witness A had taken the blame for a murder that Institoris had committed.
	
	
	Between 29 August 2002 and November 2003 police had 58 face-to-face meetings with Witness A and countless telephone calls and text messages. Witness A had a concern about going back to gaol. Inspector Jubelin emphasised that the investigator’s notes were made from conversations to the best of his and Detective Browne’s recollections, but that they may not be completely accurate. It was Witness A’s statement that should be relied upon. Witness A’s statement to police was taken over seven days from 8 May 2003. On 29 May 2003 Witness A was provided with a draft incomplete copy of the statement. On 17 June 2003 there was a meeting to work on the statement. On 19 June 2003 he was provided with a draft copy of the unsigned statement. On 14 July 2003 there was some further work on the statement and on 15 July 2003 Witness A signed his statement.
	
	
	Inspector Jubelin asked Witness A to keep them informed of anything that concerned him, in view of the fact that they were at a sensitive stage in the investigation. Witness A was seeing threatening things in his environment and relaying them to police. Both he and Detective Browne believed Witness A was “slightly paranoid with his activities with police”. Inspector Jubelin believed that Witness A “saw what he said he saw. What I took issue with was his interpretation of what he saw”.
	
	
	It was on 19 July 2003, shortly after signing his statement on 15 July 2003 that Superintendent Kaldas and Inspector Jubelin spoke to Witness A and offered the services of a psychiatrist. The signing of the statement “was a pivotal moment, I believe, in his thought process at that particular point in time. He always had concerns that once he signed off on the statement, that things were out of his control; police then had a document that we wanted and I think he felt extremely stressed and vulnerable at that time”. At one point, Witness A believed that “crooked police were behind the abduction and murder of Terry Falconer”. Despite the suggestion that he see a psychiatrist, Witness A declined to do so. He said that he would see a psychiatrist of his own choosing, but Inspector Jubelin did not know if he did so. Although Witness A had some complaints, they were not to the same extent after November 2003, when Witness A obtained his new identity and was relocated. There was little contact between him and the police from that time until 2007.
	


The abduction and death of the deceased


	
	The deceased was on work release after serving the bulk of a sentence for offences of manufacturing drugs. He was a panel beater by trade, and was employed by his friend, Alan Morcomb, who owned a smash repair business at Ingleburn. The deceased worked Monday to Saturday and the occasional Sunday. He generally arrived about 7.30-7.45am and left at 4.30-5.00pm to return to Silverwater Prison, travelling by bus and train. He was required to be back at the prison by 7.00pm.
	
	
	On the morning of Friday 16 November 2001, the deceased caught a train from Silverwater Prison to Ingleburn Railway Station and walked a short distance to the smash repair business to work for the day. He was required to wear a Corrective Services ankle bracelet. The ankle bracelet contained a monitoring device which could track his location. However, there was no electronic monitoring box at the smash repair business because the conditions of the workshop would interfere with transmission. In those circumstances, random checks were carried out by Corrective Services by attending with a hand monitor and checking manually. Although the ankle bracelet will emit a signal if it is damaged, there needs to be a box or hand held monitor within range to receive the signal.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 16 November 2001 Mr Morcomb left the workshop at 1.30pm or 2.00pm to make a delivery. When he returned around 3.00pm the deceased was gone. The foreman told him that the deceased had been taken by detectives for questioning. His daughter, who worked in the office, had already rung the gaol and was told that they knew nothing about it. Mr Morcomb went to the Macquarie Fields Police Station to make an enquiry about it. Police checked the computer and said there was no record of the deceased being taken to a police station. Mr Morcomb told police that he thought something was not right. He rang the gaol at 7:00pm and was told that the deceased had not returned and would be listed as an escapee.
	
	
	George Kaillis was the head spray painter at the business and saw a blue Ford or Holden arrive and two men get out and speak to the deceased. He saw one of them “the big fellow” put on surgical gloves and search the deceased up and down his body and look in his mouth. The men were dressed in blue suits and blue shirts and appeared to be plain clothes detectives.
	
	
	Landon Halliday was a panel beater working at the business. Sometime after 1.45pm he saw a blue VT Commodore cruise past at slow speed. It looked to him like a detective’s car as it was lowered with an FE2 suspension and had a standard rim painted silver called the “Chaser rim”. He saw two men talking to the deceased and another man was nearby. The vehicle’s engine was running. Everyone was talking calmly. The men were dressed well in business suits. Mr Halliday believed they were police officers. He saw them put handcuffs on the deceased.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Glenn Williams was a crime scene examiner attached to the Taree Crime Scene Section in 2001. On 27 November 2001, he and other police, with the assistance of SES volunteers, conducted a search of the Hastings River near Wauchope. The Hastings River at Wauchope is under tidal influence for 32 kilometres from the entrance at Port Macquarie to a point about 8 kilometres north of Wauchope. During the search, six bags containing body parts of Terry Falconer were located on the banks of the river. Bags 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were blue industrial style plastic bags gathered tight and bound with grey/silver duct tape and cut off above the tape. Each was bound with chicken wire, which encased a round river stone between the bag and the chicken wire. Bag 3 did not have grey/silver duct tape sealing it but there was a yellow plastic pull-cord sealing the bag.
	
	
	On 17 June 2008 Witness C attended the Maroubra Police Station and provided certain information in relation to Witness E. As a result, Detectives Browne and Inspector Jubelin and Superintendent McIlwain met with Witness C on 11 July 2008. From 15 September 2008 over a couple of weeks, they obtained a statement from him.
	


Witness C


	
	Except as otherwise indicated, the following evidence was given by Witness C. He was employed at the Bourbon & Beefsteak Bar in Kings Cross as Security Manager in 1997 when he met Witness E who was doing security work on the door. They became good friends. Witness C had met Anthony Perish, whom he knew as “Steve”, in about 1996 and also knew Andrew Perish. Witness C stopped working at the Bourbon & Beefsteak Bar in 1999.
	
	
	In the late 1990s Witness C and Witness E became business partners in a security firm. The firm held licences to possess firearms. Witness E purchased four or five Glock semi-automatic pistols. Witness C was aware that Witness E had an interest in firearms. The security firm also purchased two Holden standard factory Equipe Commodores in Bermuda Blue, with alloy wheels in late 1999-2000. In about 2002 the partnership was dissolved and the Glocks were sold.
	
	
	Sometime in 2001 Witness E and Witness H came to where Witness C was working, for a few drinks. While they were there, Witness E asked Witness C if he had heard about “the bloke being abducted from the panel beater’s shop by police”. Witness C said that he had. Witness E said “That was Witness H, Bottin and me that did it”. Witness E went on to say that Witness H was wearing the police uniform and he was making fun of him because the uniform did not fit properly. Witness E said it would be funny if a witness took down the numberplates as he and Bottin stole the plates from a police car and put them back on after the job.
	
	
	Witness E went on to say “We went into the panel beater’s shop and told them we were cops. We showed them a badge. We grabbed Falconer and put him into the car. There was a struggle in the back seat. I hit him too hard and he died. I really fucked up. I was only supposed to take him to somebody else to be tortured. I fucked up”. Witness C was in shock because he had been unaware that Falconer was dead. Witness H and Witness E had been drinking but they were not drunk. They were enjoying themselves, laughing and having a good time. Witness C formed the impression that when they saw that he was shocked, the conversation ended and they left him.
	
	
	A few days later, Witness E brought up the subject again. He said that he had abducted the deceased for Steve because Steve believed that the deceased and another man called Stott had murdered his grandparents. He told Witness C that “a crazy woman out Leppington way who caged up a girl and had been locked up for it” was Stott’s mother. He said that he was concerned at the time that he was going to be in trouble with Steve because the deceased had died before he got to Steve but “Steve said that it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway”.
	
	
	Witness C learned through the media that the deceased’s remains were located in the Hastings River by fishermen. Subsequently Witness E came to his house and Witness C asked him whether he had seen the article in the newspaper about the body parts turning up in the river to which Witness E said “Yes, Steve asked me if I’d ever chopped up a body before”. Witness E then told him he was going to Queensland to do some work for Steve.
	
	
	After Witness E returned from Queensland he arrived at Witness C’s home. He told Witness C that he had changed the interior of his car to leather. He opened the door and showed Witness C, who asked him why he had done it. Witness E said “It just had to be done”.
	
	
	After he returned from Queensland at the end of 2001 or early 2002 Witness E invited Witness C out to dinner. When Witness C arrived at the restaurant, he saw that Steve was present. They had a meal together and Steve said something about body parts. Steve and Witness E were talking about themselves and Witness E said to Steve “You couldn’t even get rid of the body parts” in a way that seemed like he was making fun of Steve.
	
	
	Witness C said that he ceased seeing Witness E at the end of 2007. He said that Witness E was very proud of his military training and skills. Everything Witness E told him about himself emphasised that he was mentally and physically well trained and tough. Witness E was “a very intelligent man”. Witness E told him that he could do anything that a qualified locksmith could do and seemed proficient with locks.
	
	
	Witness C denied that around 1999-2000 he borrowed $100,000 from Anthony Perish. He denied that he had a meeting with Anthony Perish at Danny’s restaurant at Bondi and asked him to lend him money for the security business. He denied he ever gave Witness E $30,000 from money that he had borrowed.
	
	
	Witness C first met Witness H when he worked at the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar. He later hired Witness H to work for him when he was running the security business. Witness C did not know Witness H particularly well. Before telling him about his involvement in the abduction of the deceased, Witness H had never told him about “illegal things”. On the occasion that Witness E and Witness H told him about their involvement with the deceased, they were not remorseful or regretful.
	


Witness B


	
	On 31 October 2006 police served Witness B with a summons to appear before the NSW Crime Commission inquiry into the murder of the deceased for a hearing on 2 November 2007. On 19 November 2007 Detective Browne served Witness B with a further summons to attend the NSW Crime Commission on 21 November 2007.
	
	
	After Witness B appeared at the inquiry, he was at a meeting with Anthony and Andrew Perish, their brother Matthew and their mother (Thea), sitting at a table. Except as otherwise indicated, Witness B gave the following evidence. Anthony Perish said to Andrew Perish, “This cunt’s been talking”. As he said this Anthony Perish tapped the side of his nose a couple of times. Anthony and Andrew Perish then went to the other side of the room and spoke amongst themselves. After returning to the table Anthony said to Witness B, “And you don’t know anything about those police uniforms”.
	
	
	After his divorce from Colleen Perish in 2000, Witness B was not invited to any family gathering where Colleen might be invited. He continued to see Anthony and to a lesser extent, Andrew. At the time of the discussion referred to in the previous paragraph, Daniel Perish, a solicitor named Monika and Albert Perish (the father of Anthony, Andrew and Daniel) were also present. In his statement Witness B said:
	


“Anthony said to Andrew, ‘Come here’ and as he did this Anthony stood up and started walking away from the table. Andrew got up to follow him and as they were walking away from the table I heard Anthony say, ‘This cunt’s been talking’.”


	
	At the time he did not know Witness A and did not know that his nickname was Nosey until he was told by police. Until then he had not appreciated the significance of Anthony Perish having tapped the side of his nose twice with his index finger. In cross-examination, Witness B agreed that he had given different accounts of who was present when this was said. This was because it was not important to him who was actually present at the time.
	
	
	In the middle of 2006, Witness B, Anthony Perish and Witness E met at a restaurant at McMahons Point which was “the restaurant where Anthony was arrested”. During the meeting, Anthony Perish said to Witness E, “Should we tell him?” Witness E said “Yes.” Anthony Perish said to Witness B “We did it”. Witness B said “Did what?” Anthony Perish said “Killed Falconer.” Witness B asked “Who killed Terry Falconer?” and Anthony Perish said, “Me and Undies and Redman was one of the kidnappers” (Redman was a nickname of Witness E and Undies was a nickname of Andrew Perish).
	
	
	Anthony Perish then said to Witness B “What, did you do it? ... Did you kill Falconer?” and Witness B said sarcastically, “Oh yeah, I killed Falconer”. At this point Witness E leaned over with a dictaphone and tried to tape the words “I killed Terry Falconer”. Witness B described the dictaphone as about five inches long and two inches wide, with a strap. He did not know if what they were saying was true or not; they were laughing. Anthony Perish said, “We killed him at Redman’s mother’s property up the coast”. Witness B was in shock. He went out to have a cigarette because he was “freaking out”.
	
	
	There was no issue that Anthony Perish and Witness E were arrested on 19 January 2009 at the Lavender Blue Café in McMahon’s Point. Witness E’s motor vehicle was searched and police located a loaded handgun, a Sony hand held dictaphone and a Forest brand hand-held dictaphone. There were three mini or micro cassette tapes found in the car. Police listened to all of the tapes which contained general conversation that had been recorded between Witness E and other people.
	
	
	When Witness B got back from having his cigarette, Witness E asked him if he wanted to commit suicide after his divorce from Colleen and he said “Yes, it had gone through [his] mind”. Witness E then tried to get him to say into the dictaphone that he wanted to kill himself. Anthony Perish was present at the time. In cross-examination Witness B agreed that in his statement he had said that he had repeated “I killed Terry Falconer” whereas in his evidence, he said that Witness E tried to make him repeat it but he did not do so. Witness B explained this discrepancy by saying he was so traumatised by what had happened that he tried to put it at the back of his mind and that is why it was not included in his statement of 27 November 2007 but was contained in his statement of March 2008. Witness B said that he had said the words “I killed Terry Falconer” because they were intimidating him.
	
	
	Witness B denied that he had lied to the Crime Commission on 2 November 2007 when he said that he knew nothing about the murder of the deceased. He agreed that when questioned by the Crime Commission he had said nothing about the conversation with Anthony Perish about getting access to police uniforms. He denied that this was because the conversation had not occurred. He had put that matter to the back of his mind and did not want to remember it. That is why he said nothing about it until his statement to the police on 27 November 2007. He had remembered it because Anthony Perish had stalked him at the St George Rowing Club and made threatening phone calls to him, forcing him into this position.
	
	
	Witness B said that he had met Witness E ten or fifteen times and knew him quite well and that they got along quite well. He did not know the deceased. When he first said “I killed Terry Falconer”, he did so in a sarcastic tone of voice not by way of admission. This was not in his first statement to police because his post-traumatic stress disorder allowed him to remember only bits and pieces.
	
	
	On 18 November 2007 Witness B was at the St George Rowing Club with his mother and girlfriend. Witness E rang him and told him that they would be there in one minute. Anthony Perish and Witness E arrived about a minute later. Anthony Perish asked him “Who do they reckon it is?” and Witness B said “You and Undies”. Anthony Perish said “Oh, good”. He then said “Get in the car. Tell your dad we’ve got to go for a road trip and we’ll be back in a week”. Witness B did not agree to this. He felt intimidated. (Exhibit H comprised five colour photographs of Anthony Perish and Witness E outside the St George Rowing Club taken from CCTV footage dated 18 November 2007. Witness B had not spoken to police before 18 November 2007 in relation to the killing of the deceased. The photographs were first shown to him by police on 13 March 2008).
	
	
	In his statement to police on 29 November 2007, Witness B had made no mention of having been followed to the St George Rowing Club by Anthony Perish and Witness E, or that he felt intimidated by their presence. He maintained that Anthony Perish and Witness E had followed him to the Club and did not accept that they were there because they wanted to meet him there. (Exhibit J was the intercepted phone call of 18 November 2007 in which Witness E contacted Witness B and said that they would see him at the Rowing Club).
	


Witness E


	
	On Monday 19 January 2009 Witness E and Anthony Perish were arrested in Blues Point Road, McMahons Point. Witness E was taken to Chatswood Police Station and declined to be interviewed.
	
	
	On 22 January 2009, Witness E participated in an electronically recorded interview at the Parramatta Police Station regarding the murder of the deceased. Detective Browne was not aware of any deals discussed, negotiations conducted or contact had with the Director of Public Prosecutions or police as between those authorities and Witness E in respect of any promise or inducement or anything of that kind.
	
	
	Before the interview with Witness E, police were not aware of the property at Girvan. Witness E told them about the property, gave them directions and ultimately took them there. As a result of this information, police attended the property and executed a search warrant.
	
	
	On 22 January 2009 Matthew Lawton was arrested and charged. Andrew Perish was arrested on 5 February 2009.
	
	
	Witness E pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following offences:
	



	
	Maliciously shooting Garry Mack with intent to do grievous bodily harm on 14 October 2001;
	
	
	Kidnapping Terrence Falconer for advantage during which detaining Mr Falconer died on about 16 November 2001.
	
	
	Being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Terrence Falconer by Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton by assisting them on or about 16 November 2001.
	
	
	Conspiring to murder Felix Lyle or Dallas Fitzgerald between 12 July and 9 October 2002.
	
	
	Shooting a pistol at Raniera Puketapa with intent to murder him on 8 October 2002.
	
	
	Possessing an unregistered firearm, a .45 Norinco pistol on 19 January 2009.
	
	
	Possessing seven unregistered firearms, including one prohibited firearm and four pistols, they being circumstances of aggravation, when he was not authorised to do so, on 19 January 2009.
	
	
	Possessing a prohibited weapon, a pistol silencer, without being authorised to do so by permit on 19 January 2009.
	



	
	When Witness E was sentenced by Judge Sweeney in the District Court on 28 May 2010, her Honour took into account a further 14 offences on a Form 1 when sentencing for the third count (the accessory charge). Those offences were seven aggravated armed robberies, firing a firearm in a public place, a specially aggravated break, enter and steal, manufacturing a prohibited drug, supplying a prohibited drug, possession of a tablet press, damaging property by fire, and taking and driving a motorcycle without the owner’s consent. Those offences occurred between 2000 and 2008.
	
	
	Her Honour also took into account when sentencing him for the seventh count, a further three offences on a second Form 1, being two offences of possessing a prohibited weapon, and one of possessing items of police uniform, all relating to items found at his home on 19 January 2009.
	
	
	Witness E was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 15 years. He received a 50 per cent discount for his pleas of guilty, and for his past and future assistance to police. Her Honour quantified 15 per cent of that discount for future assistance, which included Witness E undertaking to give evidence in the trial.
	


Witness E’s ERISP


	
	After his arrest on 19 January 2009, Witness E participated in an ERISP on 22 January 2009 with Detectives Browne and Edwards. Except as otherwise indicated, the following sets out the effect of what Witness E said in his ERISP. His description of how he met Witness C accords with the evidence of Witness C on that subject. When he first met Anthony Perish, he did not know much about him but on one occasion, Anthony Perish had given him $2,000 sponsorship money for motorcycle racing. On an occasion when he and Witness C had lunch with Anthony Perish at Danny’s restaurant at Bondi Beach, Witness C had formally asked him for a $100,000 loan. Sometime after that Anthony Perish gave Witness C $100,000 cash and Witness C gave $30,000 of it to Witness E.
	
	
	Anthony Perish approached Witness E, through Witness C, and asked him to look into some information which he had, before the coronial inquest into the death of his grandparents. Anthony Perish said that he wanted to bring the guilty people to justice and that Witness E should start investigating it. Witness E identified a number of people who might have been involved, including Justin Birk Hill, a solicitor from South Australia, a woman known as “Mad Wendy” [Stott] and the deceased. Anthony Perish said they needed to get a hold of the deceased and get him to give up who did it. Witness E said, “From my understanding at that stage he didn’t think that Falconer was directly involved in the doing of it, but knew information about it.” Anthony Perish told Witness E that the deceased was on day release, working at a smash repairer’s at Ingleburn.
	
	
	Anthony Perish had arranged for a person whose nickname was Snowy, to observe the deceased and call in when he was at the smash repair shop. The plan was for Witness E and others to pose as police, cut the tracking device off, take the deceased to be questioned by Anthony Perish and then drop him back. “Witness C and I decided” to get Craig Bottin and Witness H to help. Anthony Perish said he would pay $15,000 and take some more money off the amount owing on the loan. Witness E and Witness C did not think at any stage that the deceased was going to be killed. Anthony Perish advised Witness E to get a van, a box and a police badge. Witness E rented a badge for $200 and Anthony Perish provided a general duties police shirt. Witness E used his personal car and Matthew Lawton sourced wheels that looked like detectives’ wheels and painted them at the Turramurra house. Witness E did not know the address at Turramurra, but told police that he could point it out.
	
	
	Anthony Perish instructed Witness E: “He’ll put up a fight, so make sure you handcuff him and put this anaesthetic over his mouth”. He told Witness E it was “kind of like a chloroform” and would help him sleep until he got to Turramurra. Witness E drove the van to an area not far from the smash repairer’s. He could not recall if Anthony Perish had provided the lock box and pad bolts but thought that he had, because he [Witness E] did not have the keys. “Bodgie number plates” and the wheels Matthew Lawton had painted silver were placed on Witness E’s car. Witness E put a magnetic two-way radio aerial on one side to make it look more like a vehicle that was used by detectives.
	
	
	Witness E, Bottin and Witness H drove to the smash repair premises where they posed as police officers. He and Bottin wore suits like detectives and Witness H wore a police shirt and dark blue pants. Witness E told the deceased that they needed to take him in for questioning and the deceased said “Oh, not again”. He appeared to accept they were police. Witness E put on latex gloves and searched him, handcuffed him at the front and took him to the vehicle. Witness E sat on his left and Bottin was on his right. The deceased said “I hope it’s not about those silly murders”. Witness E pretended they had to “suss out” the van and when they drove near it Witness E put some of the chemical on a handkerchief and put it over the deceased’s face. The deceased struggled for about thirty seconds so that Bottin had to help to subdue him.
	
	
	Either Bottin or Witness H helped Witness E carry the deceased into the van and put him into the lock box. Witness E did not know where the ankle bracelet was discarded because Bottin took care of that. Witness E did not recall what kind of firearm he was carrying; it was in a holster on his hip, as was Bottin’s. He did not think that Witness H was carrying a firearm. (The ankle bracelet was not found until 22 April 2002 when a Corrective Services Officer picked up the signal by chance.)
	
	
	The deceased was “really really dopey”. Witness H had already opened the side of the van and opened the lock box. They put him in the box and Witness E tossed the handkerchief in with him. He secured the box and put the pad bolts on it. He and the other two then changed their clothes, hubcaps were put over the wheel rims and the licence plate was changed. Bottin and Witness H then left that location in Witness E’s car.
	
	
	Witness E drove the van to Anthony Perish’s house at Turramurra. The deceased was coughing in the back and banging on the sides of the box. On arrival Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton were there. One of them directed Witness E to drive the van into the garage. Anthony Perish said “Well?” and Witness E gave him the thumbs up. They took the box out and someone opened it with the keys. As soon as it opened, the deceased started to get up and Witness E put his foot on his torso. Anthony Perish grabbed his head and slammed it down, saying “Yep”. Anthony Perish pulled up the deceased’s shirt and Witness E saw that he had a Gypsy Joker tattoo. Anthony Perish shut the lid and Witness E said “Man, don’t you think we should get him out? He’s pretty hot in there”. Anthony Perish put his hand on a silver five-shot revolver and said “Are you fuckin’ with us or what?”. Witness E said “Man, I think he needs to get up” because the deceased looked “fucked” and “struggling”. Anthony Perish became irate at being questioned.
	
	
	Anthony Perish said “you and Muzz [Matthew Lawton] … take it up to this place, we can get rid of it”. Anthony Perish had his hand on his gun the whole time. He said that he would get rid of the van. They put the box in the back of an XD ute with NSW registration plates beginning VDE and ending in a 2. Witness E saw that Muzz now had a gun. Witness E was unarmed. He felt under threat and thought if he bailed out his family would be under threat. He believed that he had to play along. He got into the ute and they drove the back way to the property at Girvan, which “took ages”. Witness E thought that if the deceased “spent another hour in that box he would, he was going to be dead for sure”. When the box was put back into the ute the tarp was put over the box.
	
	
	Witness E did not know how long it took to get to Girvan but thought “this guy’s not going to survive that trip, he was already hot back at Turramurra”. When they arrived at Girvan, Matthew Lawton said “Let’s go inside” and Witness E asked “Aren’t we going to get him out?” Matthew Lawton said “No, we’ll wait for mate”, referring to Anthony Perish. Witness E had heard noises from the back of the ute “initially, but not for long”.
	
	
	Anthony Perish arrived “hours later”. They took the box into the shed and someone cut the padlock bolts off because the keys had been left behind. When they opened the box the deceased was dead. They put on suits and gloves and Witness E helped roll out heavy plastic sheeting. Anthony Perish threw a suit to Witness E and told him to put it on. He said “Just remember everyone last saw you with the body, they’re gonna think you’re the killer, even your own mates. You’re the one that’s been seen, your car, but I’ll help ya, I’ll help ya get rid of it.”
	
	
	Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton then suspended the deceased’s body using a block and tackle and started cutting him up. Anthony Perish threw a leg to Witness E and said “Here get into it” and passed him an implement. After the deceased’s body was cut up they packaged him in plastic bags, took up the plastic sheeting and placed it in a bag and poured hydrochloric acid on the floor. Anthony Perish extracted the deceased’s teeth before he was suspended on the block and tackle. The deceased was suspended by the handcuffs. Witness E could not remember if his clothes were cut off before or after he was suspended. The bags in which the body parts were contained, were secured with electrical tape.
	
	
	Witness E described the suits as like a “white-ish fibreglassing suit”, “a plastic-y material”, “like a spray painter’s one”. He thought “it contained feet in it”. Witness E, Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton cut up the body. Witness E said “I never intended for that guy to die. He didn’t even ask him one fucken question”. The next day the bags were loaded into the ute and Witness E rode with Lawton to an off-ramp near the Pacific Highway where they waited for Anthony Perish. He arrived in his four-wheel drive, they swapped cars and Witness E and Matthew Lawton drove the four-wheel drive back to Turramurra while Anthony Perish drove off in the ute.
	
	
	The metal box, the handcuffs, padlocks and anything else used at the property were burned at the front of the property to the left-hand side.
	
	
	Witness H, Bottin, Witness C and Witness E were each paid $5000 to “just take a guy to be questioned about their grandparents’ murder”. The deceased “was alive when he got to Turramurra, he was still active, he was coughing, he was breathing. He was very hot, very red in the face but he was alive, he still had strength”.
	
	
	When the body parts were found and identified as the deceased’s, Witness E told Witness H and Bottin different versions of the story. He recalled telling both of them that “the guy had to die because he was going to rat on us”. He remembered being instructed by Anthony Perish “to tell [Witness C] that he died because of a broken neck and it was all an accident”. Witness E identified a photograph of Matthew Lawton and wrote Lawton’s name and nicknames (Muzz and Bristle Hound) on the photograph.
	
	
	Witness E could not recall how long before the kidnapping he was first approached by Anthony Perish. He thought it was not as long as a year before, but he was given the documentation more than three months before. Anthony Perish told him “the best way to get answers about who murdered his grandparents was to take this guy that was on day release … the only way to do that in a way which won’t arouse suspicion so you can get away is to do it by dressing up as cops, bring him back to me and we can question him and he’ll tell us the answers”. That conversation occurred at least three months prior to the abduction. Witness E was following Anthony Perish’s directions in relation to what to do and how to do it. Witness E recruited Bottin and Witness H to “take him [Falconer] in for some questioning, rough him up and then drop him off later”. Anthony Perish decided it should take place at the smash repair business.
	
	
	Anthony Perish was organising Matthew Lawton to prepare the wheels. Witness E was to get the police badge and get the uniform from Anthony Perish. Anthony Perish was to provide the anaesthetic. The silver wheels were provided a day or two before the abduction.
	
	
	The box was galvanised tin and big enough “to fit a grown man in so he didn’t have to be crunched up”. It was close to six feet long, maybe five and a half feet long. Bottin got the “bodgie plates” from another Commodore.
	
	
	Witness E was asked if, to his knowledge, Andrew Perish was involved in the kidnapping or murder of the deceased and answered “I can’t say that he was at all. I did not see him or hear from him or know that he had any part”.
	
	
	Witness H and Bottin “never went to Turramurra … everyone was always at arm’s length”.
	
	
	Witness E had the upholstery, carpet and seatbelts in his car changed because “I’d used my personal car and there could be his DNA on my personal car”.
	


Evidence of Witness E at trial


	
	Witness E gave evidence at trial. Except as otherwise indicated, the following is the effect of the evidence of Witness E at trial. He understood that if he did not adhere to his promise to give evidence at the trial, he could be re-sentenced in relation to the eight offences with which he had been charged.
	
	
	Witness C was his boss at the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar when he started working there as a security guard in the mid-1990s. He met Anthony Perish, whom he knew as Steve Perish, when he used to come to the bar. Later Witness E and Witness C became business partners in a security firm, which subsequently had some financial difficulties. Witness C received a $100,000 loan from Anthony Perish.
	
	
	Anthony Perish spoke to Witness E about his grandparents having been murdered and that the police had “botched up the investigation” and that he wanted to find out who was responsible and whether or not there had been a cover up. Sometime later, at Turramurra, Anthony Perish provided Witness E with a folder of documents. Before reading the documents Witness E had never heard of the deceased. He could not recall when it was that the plan to abduct the deceased first arose. He did not recall whose idea it was to carry out the abduction or the conversation in relation to the idea of the abduction.
	
	
	He recalled that someone put “dodgy plates” on his company car and that he put an antenna on it so it resembled a detective’s car. He knew the wheels had been changed but did not remember them being changed or any conversation about the wheels being changed.
	
	
	Witness E referred to Anthony Perish as “the client” and said that he requested that certain questions be asked of the deceased. Witness E abducted the deceased and took him to a grassy area where there was a van. He could not remember who put the deceased in the galvanised box, but remembered that he took the deceased’s feet to carry him. He did not remember locking the box. He thought that the deceased “would have been conscious”. He remembered that he handcuffed the deceased but could not remember if he took off the handcuffs. He drove to the house at Turramurra. The other two did not come with him. Either Anthony Perish or Matthew Lawton was at the house, or it could have been Roy [there was no evidence as to who Roy was] instead of Matthew Lawton. When specifically asked if Matthew Lawton had assisted in any way in the preparation of the abduction Witness E answered “Not to my knowledge”. Witness E did not think that he had spoken to Matthew Lawton in the days or weeks leading up to the abduction. After he drove the van into the garage he and one other person took the galvanized box out. He remembered observing that “the guy looked pretty crook”; “I think he was alive”. He recalled the deceased “in the back coughing”.
	
	
	Witness E recalled driving north with either Matthew Lawton or Roy. He remembered being on a property but did not know what area it was in. He remembered sleeping the night there. Either Matthew Lawton or Roy was also there.
	
	
	He remembered an occasion when he had something to eat with Anthony Perish and Witness B and agreed that he possessed a hand held tape recorder in order to record conversations. He denied having that device with him at the meal with Anthony Perish and Witness B and did not recall taping what Witness B said. He identified himself and Anthony Perish in a photograph outside the St Georges Rowing Club (Exhibit H). When he was played Exhibit J (the call between himself and Witness B) he believed that Anthony Perish spoke with Witness B but he did not know what they spoke about because he went to the toilet or for a drink.
	
	
	At trial the ERISP of Witness E of 22 January 2009 (Exhibit AA) was played to the jury and Witness E was cross-examined on it by the Crown pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The effect of that evidence was as follows.
	
	
	Witness E did not remember an occasion when he, Anthony Perish and Witness B were in a café at McMahon’s Point and the topic of the deceased arose. He did not remember giving evidence at committal proceedings on 16 June 2010. He was read evidence in which he said “I recall Anthony was having a conversation with [Witness B] and did make reference to the Falconer abduction. I don’t remember the exact content of what was said. I really didn’t want to get involved in that conversation”. Witness E did not recall giving that answer and did not recall the abduction of the deceased having been discussed.
	
	
	When it was put to him that what he told the police about Anthony Perish’s role in recruiting him for the abduction was the truth, Witness E said “I can’t say that. What I can remember is that Anthony said that the guy needed to be asked some questions”.
	
	
	It was put to him that in the execution of the abduction plan, Matthew Lawton changed the appearance of the rims of his car. Witness E said “I don’t remember the execution of the plan”. He did not recall the manner in which Mr Falconer’s body was dismembered. He could not recall having the interview with police. He could not recall certain aspects of the crime.
	
	
	Witness E had been in solitary confinement for a long time. In cross-examination by the defence, he agreed this could be a factor that affected his ability to recall things. He had recently had some major surgery and had been ill, which was another factor. He did not recall giving evidence in the committal proceedings in which he said that he did not recall if Matthew Lawton was present during the planning and discussions between himself and Anthony Perish. He did not recall Matthew Lawton being involved in the planning, however he could not remember the planning.
	
	
	He did not recall what he told Witness H or Bottin about the deceased when they were planning the abduction. He did not recall purchasing the lock box but said “I am pretty sure I would have”. He did not recall a decision being made to place the deceased in the lock box.
	
	
	He agreed he had a background as an investigator and in martial arts, had military and security training in relation to firearms, had a couple of Glock pistols and had been a Commando for four and a half years and was proud of this.
	
	
	He could not recall having a conversation with Anthony Perish during which a decision was made to kidnap the deceased and ask him some questions. He was not able to recall evidence which he gave at the committal proceedings concerning a discussion between himself and Anthony Perish on the day of the abduction in which Anthony Perish had told him that the job was to go ahead.
	
	
	He did not recall obtaining the chloroform-like substance or the handcuffs. He did not recall having to punch the deceased to subdue him and did not recall seeing Bottin punch the deceased to the right side of his face near his right eye and temple area. He did not remember if he hit the deceased. He thought his hands were holding the deceased’s head and that he was blocking himself from the deceased’s strikes. The deceased became progressively limp and gradually stopped struggling and became very drowsy. He did not recall if the deceased was on his back or on his side, but he was definitely not on his face. The deceased was not coherent. The cloth Witness E threw into the box had a “methy” smell.
	
	
	Witness E did not recall if he checked to see whether there was sufficient air getting into the box, but thought he would have checked that there were gaps between the lid. He accepted that there was a risk in using a chemical he did not know. He did not stop during the journey to Turramurra. He did not recall telling Witness C that he had killed the deceased. He said that “if the intent was something to cause his life to end, I would definitely have not used my car”.
	
	
	Witness E denied that when he left Turramurra he knew that the deceased was dead. He did not recall saying to Matthew Lawton or Anthony Perish “I hit him but I didn’t think I hit him that hard”. He did not recall telling Witness C that he had hit the deceased too hard and killed him.
	
	
	He did not recall telling Witness H that it was necessary for him to kill the deceased “because he was going to dob on everyone”. He did not recall telling Witness H that he chopped off the deceased’s head. He agreed that he might have told him a different version of events. He might tell different people “a different version, because then if someone goes bad you can tell who”.
	
	
	Witness E denied that when he said in his ERISP that Anthony Perish had told him “We can get rid of it”, he had referred to the deceased as “it” because he was already dead when he arrived at Turramurra.
	
	
	After watching his ERISP in court, Witness E said “there are peculiarities with it”, including that his solicitor rang and he did not ask to speak to his solicitor. Other peculiarities were that his family was mentioned first and “I seem robotic initially” and “at the end when they go did you make this of your own free will, it’s like I didn’t, even though I said I did”.
	
	
	He agreed that he was leading a double life when he was committing offences and had hidden his criminal lifestyle from his wife. He agreed he had a loaded gun in his car when he was arrested. Searches of his house and his mother’s house located firearms, ammunition, wigs, masks, an SAS survival handbook, police shoulder patches, balaclavas and other items. The wigs were for disguise when he or someone working for him did reconnaissance. He also had Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) at one of the properties under his control.
	
	
	Witness E denied that in his ERISP he minimised his role in the death of the deceased and had agreed to give evidence against Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton in order to cut a deal. He agreed that in the five years before his arrest, he had completed a university course, had a fulltime job and was doing consultancy work but had also stolen a motorcycle in Balmain and stored it in his mother’s garage. In 2008 he used the motorcycle during an armed robbery. He agreed that putting the deceased into a box with little air while he was under the effects of chloroform was a mistake and that he “should have organised holes” but he did not believe it resulted in his death. He denied that his lack of recall and memory was a ploy and playacting. He agreed that he had received $30,000 from Witness C, but did not know where it came from but was told it came from Anthony Perish. He could not remember if his job was to abduct the deceased, take him to Anthony Perish to be questioned and then return him to the gaol. He did not recall having a conversation with Witness C in which he said “I really fucked up there. He was only supposed to be taken to somebody else. I fucked up.” He did not recall his ERISP so he could not answer whether he was trying to portray himself as an unwilling participant in what happened at Girvan.
	
	
	Witness E continued to have contact with Anthony Perish after the events of 2001 and had invited him to his wedding in 2008. They were together at a café in McMahon’s Point when they were arrested. He could not remember who was at Turramurra when he arrived and what was said. He did not recall Anthony Perish being present when the box was opened at Turramurra. He could not remember Matthew Lawton being at Turramurra. He could not recall any discussion at Girvan about what to do with the deceased’s body. Witness E thought that one of the reasons why he had trouble remembering things was because he had been deliberately refused medical care while in prison.
	
	
	When Witness E was asked whether as a joke, he would confess to killing someone he said “I guess you would only joke with people you trust, wouldn’t you. If you were going to say something like that”. He did not recall being asked to kill the deceased. If he had agreed to “knock” him, he would have just shot him. The fact that he was not wearing a disguise meant that it was “not that sort of job”.
	
	
	He did not recall telling Witness H that he had chopped off the deceased’s head, nor saying to him “the bloke we picked up is dead, he was going to rat on us and he had to go”. Witness E got on very well with Witness H. They trusted each other and they had committed a number of criminal offences together, including armed robberies. He was the person who told Witness H what to do.
	


Witness H


	
	Witness H worked as a security guard at the Bourbon and Beefsteak Bar in 1998. He met Witness C and Witness E when doing that work. Witness C was initially in the senior position and subsequently Witness E performed the duties of Operations Manager. Witness H used to socialise with Witness C on a monthly basis and with Witness E every ten days or so, usually at bars around Kings Cross. Except where otherwise indicated, his evidence was as follows.
	
	
	He became very close to Witness E, looked up to him as an older brother figure. When Witness C and Witness E set up their security business, he went to work for them. He was aware that Witness E had been a Special Forces soldier with the Commando Regiment in the Army and had experience with a wide variety of firearms
	
	
	In 2000 he had a falling out with Witness C, but remained friends with Witness E. In 2001 he became aware of Witness E’s involvement in criminal activities. In the middle of 2001 he had a meeting with Witness E and Bottin, during which Witness E initially brought up the abduction plan. Witness E said: “There’s a job that has come up. There’s a guy who he needs to get information, a guy who has done terrible things, he’s a scum bag”. Witness E needed him and Bottin to help out because “this is a guy who’s able to take care of himself physically”. Witness E told them the person was on work release from Silverwater Gaol.
	
	
	Within a week there was a second meeting, at which more details of the plan were outlined. Witness E proposed that they dress up as police officers and pretend to arrest the deceased and take him away for questioning. Witness E was to use chloroform to drug the deceased as he thought this was the best way to cause the least harm. It was to be done at the place of his work release. Witness H’s role would be that of driver and he would be wearing something that resembled a police uniform. Bottin’s role was to assist Witness E in “arresting” the deceased. Witness E did not indicate from where he was going to obtain things that resembled police items, such as uniforms. They were to meet at a rendezvous point where the hub caps were to be taken off the car to make it look like it had police “Chaser” rims, an aerial put on the back window and the licence plates changed. The result was to make it look like an unmarked detective’s car. Both he and Bottin were sceptical about joining the enterprise insofar as dressing up as police officers was concerned, but Witness E continued to push them to help him because they were the only two people he could trust to do the job with.
	
	
	On the day of the abduction, Witness H took the car to pick up Bottin and drove to a grassy embankment a short distance from the smash repair business where Witness E was waiting with a white work van with sliding doors. They changed into their uniforms. Bottin took the hubcaps off the Commodore, changed the licence plates and an aerial was put on the back window. Witness H drove to the smash repair business. Once there, Bottin and Witness E went inside and spoke to a younger man and then to the deceased, who was handcuffed and led to the car. Witness H saw the police badge that Witness E produced to the deceased and it appeared genuine. Bottin and Witness E each had Glock pistols with them. Witness H was provided with what looked like a police shirt with police badges on either side and a pair of dark navy blue pants.
	
	
	Witness E placed the deceased in the rear of the car and he and Bottin sat either side of him. As Witness H drove to the grassy embankment, he heard Witness E and the deceased have a brief conversation. He then heard a scuffle in the backseat. He turned around and saw Witness E placing what looked like a rag with the chloroform on it on the deceased’s mouth. The deceased was almost unconscious and was “putting up a bit of a struggle”. It was only a matter of seconds before the deceased became unconscious in the rear of the vehicle. Witness H did not see anyone strike the deceased physically in any way before or during the process of rendering him unconscious. Witness H did not recall seeing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet on the deceased.
	
	
	At the grassy embankment, Witness H was told to open the sliding door of the van and open the toolbox. The use of the toolbox came as a surprise to him. Witness H described the box as being like a normal toolbox, “that a tradie would use but there were no tools in it”. After he opened the toolbox he saw Witness E and Bottin carry the deceased to the box by his arms and legs. The deceased was placed in the toolbox on his back, wearing his clothes. He was snoring. Witness H expressed concern that he was going to be placed in a box and Witness E said, “Yeah, yeah, don’t fucken worry about him. He’ll be all right. He’ll be dropped off before the day’s out”. The lid was shut.
	
	
	He and Bottin then changed their clothes. The number plates were replaced, the aerial taken off and the hubcaps put back on. He and Bottin then left Witness E with the deceased in the box in the van. Before they left, Witness E told him to wash the exterior and interior of the car, which he did at a carwash, and to park the car at his [Witness H’s] unit where it was not visible from the street in the underground car park. As far as Witness H was aware, no items of clothing were left behind at the grassy embankment.
	
	
	Witness H next saw Witness E a couple of days later when he came to collect his car. He and Witness E went to lunch at a restaurant at Double Bay. Before this meeting, Witness H did not know the deceased’s name. At lunch Witness E said, “Look, I don’t know if you’ve heard or read anything, but Falconer had to go. He was going to rat us out.” Witness E said words to the effect, “I’m sorry I told you it wasn’t meant to happen this way”. Witness H was shocked and upset, so Witness E dropped the subject. To smooth things over, Witness E handed him $7,000 in cash.
	
	
	They were at the café for about 45 minutes and then went to have a few drinks and play the pokies. After about an hour and a half, Witness E brought up the topic again and told Witness H that “Falconer was not giving him the answers he wanted, he was being a smart arse. So as an effect of this, he chopped Falconer’s head off”. They never spoke of the killing of the deceased again.
	
	
	Witness E was happy with his and Bottin’s professionalism on the job, but was concerned to ensure that he and Bottin kept their mouths shut. Not long after this, Bottin was arrested on unrelated matters and Witness E and he contributed to Bottin’s legal fees.
	
	
	In cross-examination Witness H agreed that when Witness E told him that the deceased “was going to rat on us … he had to go” he was shocked but he “knew he was capable of it”. He agreed that when Witness E said, “It was not meant to happen this way. He got a bit lippy and he was mouthing off and being smart, so I went up and chopped his head off” Witness H had not doubted that this had occurred since he knew that Witness E was capable of chopping off someone’s head. He interpreted these two statements to mean that Witness E had killed the deceased. He agreed that Witness E had never said to him that someone else had killed the deceased. Witness E had a dominating personality and was very persuasive.
	
	
	As far as he was aware, Witness C did not play any part in the plan. Witness E used to try to plan everything like a military operation. The toolbox into which the deceased was placed, did not have any obvious part where air could get in. There were no air holes drilled in it that he could see. His main concern was that once the lid was closed, the deceased might not be able to breathe and in order to allay his fears, Witness E told him that the deceased was not going to be in the box for long. Witness E never told him that he had died before he was able to be questioned.
	


Post mortem results


	
	Professor Timothy Lyons, Chief Forensic Pathologist at the Department of Forensic Medicine at Newcastle gave evidence in relation to the two post-mortem examinations conducted by Dr Kevin Lee, who was no longer with the Department. The first autopsy was conducted on 28 November 2001. The remains that were presented were in six plastic bags. After each bag was opened and the contents observed and recorded, Dr Lee reconstructed the body with the remains. He noted that the remains were found to be almost complete, however the internal organs were missing as was the anterior abdominal wall.
	
	
	Dr Lee listed four signs of recent injury, being:
	



	
	An ill-defined area of bruising extending from the lateral right cheek passing the outer aspect of the eye to involve the right lateral forehead and extending into the hair line. (Bruising occurs when someone is alive and does not occur if the person is dead.) This bruising was due to blunt force trauma injury. It could have been the result of a blow with a fist or a boot. It was the sort of injury that could occur if that part of the body were knocked against a hard surface.
	
	
	A transverse laceration approximately 3.9 centimetre long, situated just under the central part of the point of the chin without evidence of surrounding bruising.
	
	
	An ill-defined area of apparent light bruising situated over the right middle side of the jaw.
	
	
	An ill-defined area of skin damage resembling superficial burning was present in the right armpit, extending over an area approximately 12 centimetres in diameter. It was Dr Lee’s view that the lesions he was seeing were blisters. The blisters took the form of a series of closely spaced rounded blisters. The blisters resembled superficial burning of the skin. There was no singeing of the axillary hair, and the border between it and the normal undamaged skin was clearly defined. Dr Lee did not state an opinion as to how such burns might have been caused.
	



	
	There were numerous post-mortem injuries due to the way in which the body had been dissected. There was an area of light bruising over the inner aspect of the left wrist and a small area of bruising on the radial aspect of the right wrist. Dr Lee’s pathological findings were:
	



	
	The body was dismembered.
	
	
	There were multiple penetrating and incised wounds
	
	
	Evisceration.
	



	
	A second autopsy was conducted on 18 September 2002 at Newcastle after the discovery of the seventh bag. The contents of that bag were the missing internal organs, his lungs, his bowel and his lower jaw which was the mandible that was noted as missing during the first autopsy. Also located in the bag was a series of ribs and rib cartilages.
	
	
	The skin that was missing from the remains in the first six bags was also located in the seventh bag. By using tattoos, Dr Lee was able to match the remains from the seventh bag with the remains of the other six. On the skin that covers the lower chest and abdomen, was a part completed tattoo of a skull wearing a jester’s cap with skulls as bells. This was recognised as the insignia of the Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club which was more established in South Australia than New South Wales.
	
	
	The cause of death was unable to be determined. If someone is in a box where there is no clear ventilation, that person might find themselves in a situation of lack of oxygen. If a person were unconscious and was lying on their back they would have an unprotected airway. Normally an unconscious person is placed in the coma position on their side to keep the airways open. Over time while lying on one’s back, the body would consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide levels could then rise to a level that would adversely affect the brain and the heart to the point that the person stopped breathing. It was possible that someone in a very restricted area who was snoring, on his back and was subjected to some form of anaesthesia could die within two hours.
	


Phone records


	
	The Crown led expert evidence concerning the phone records. Because of the lapse of time between when events occurred and when police sought to examine the phone records, many of the records had disappeared because telecoms at the time only kept records for limited periods.
	
	
	There were records of calls made from a Vodafone number used by Andrew Perish from 1 September 2001 to 16 September 2002. Reverse call charge records were not available for that phone.
	
	
	There were two mobile phone numbers associated with Witness A. “Mobile 1” was used by Witness A but was registered in the name of Tracey Hill. Reference has already been made to calls from that phone to Andrew Perish. After 9 October 2001 there were no calls from Mobile 1 to Andrew Perish. “Mobile 2” was also associated with Witness A. It was registered in the name of Paul Jeffreys. Records were available for that phone for the period 1 October 2001 to 17 November 2001. Reference has already been made to calls from that phone. Witness A also used the “McDowell phone”. It was activated on 29 October 2001 and last used on 26 November 2001. Exhibit HH was the summary of calls between the various phones that showed contact between Witness A and Andrew Perish by calls and texts and phone contact between Witness A and Marine Scene. That summary and the records did not contain all the usage of the identified telephone numbers.
	
	
	After the McDowell phone was activated on 29 October 2001, Andrew Perish did not initiate contact to Mobile 1 or Mobile 2 until 14 November 2001. The McDowell phone was not used between 12 November and 20 November 2001. Mobile 1 did not make any outgoing calls after Friday 9 November 2001. Mobile 2 made no outgoing calls from 12 November until the end of the available records which was 18 November 2001. All incoming calls were diverted.
	
	
	On 14 November 2001 the Andrew Perish phone called Mobile 2 three times. No return call was made from any of the Witness A phones. On Thursday, 15 November 2001 there were two calls from the Andrew Perish phone to Mobile 2. There was no return call made from any of the Witness A phones. From Friday 16 November 2001 until the end of the records on 29 August 2002, there were no calls from the Andrew Perish phone to Mobile 1 or Mobile 2.
	


The search of the Girvan property and related evidence


	
	On Thursday 19 March 2009, a crime scene warrant was executed at the property at 158 Brooks Road, Girvan. Photographs were taken. In the walkaround, Witness E indicated to police a beam within the main shed from which the deceased had been hung. When tested, the beam easily took the weight of a policeman weighing 85 kilograms, which was more than the deceased had weighed at the time of his death.
	
	
	As part of the forensic examinations, a number of fingerprints were discovered within buildings on the property. Anthony Perish’s fingerprints were identified on a can of air freshener in the toilet in the house and on a bottle of pasta sauce in a kitchen cupboard. Matthew Lawton’s fingerprint was identified on a jar of coffee in the kitchen of the house. It was not possible to estimate when the fingerprints were deposited on the items.
	
	
	On 16 April 2009, an additional crime scene warrant was executed at that property. An area was excavated where there had been a fire which was then backfilled. During the examination, a number of items were located including the remains of a large metal tool box, a padlock, three saw blades, a ball hammer head, plastic sheeting and portions of plastic garbage bags similar to the bags in which the deceased’s remains were located. One of the items collected was a section of blue plastic with a yellow pull cord which was consistent in appearance with the bags in which the deceased’s remains were located in the Hastings River.
	
	
	Items retrieved from the burned out area included the remains of a hammer, burnt pieces of a meat tenderising mallet, a hacksaw blade, an electric saw blade, a broken hacksaw blade, chicken wire, a partially burnt thick black plastic like a drop sheet, part of a blue plastic garbage bag with a yellow cord attached and silver coloured duct tape. The dimensions of the box were estimated at 500mm wide, 500mm high and in excess of 1760mm long.
	


The evidence and cases for the defence

Case for Anthony Perish


	
	Anthony Perish pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise to abduct the deceased. It was his case that when Witness E arrived at North Turramurra and the box was opened, the deceased was already dead. Through his counsel he sought to show that he had loaned money to Witness A to repair his boat as a friendly gesture and had not engaged him to assist in the disposal of the deceased’s body.
	
	
	Through his counsel he admitted that from December 2000 through to August 2002 he did reside at North Turramurra and that between 1999 and 2009 he had access to and stayed at the property at 158 Brooks Road, Girvan. He accepted that on 16 November 2001 the body of the deceased was dismembered at that property at Girvan.
	
	
	He had one conviction for offensive language in 1990. He did not give evidence or call any witnesses.
	


Case for Matthew Lawton


	
	Matthew Lawton did not give evidence or call witnesses.
	
	
	It was his case that he was Anthony Perish’s driver and did not hear any conversations between Witness A and Anthony Perish. He was not at the Turramurra property when Witness E arrived in the white van. When he arrived at Turramurra the deceased was already dead.
	


Case for Andrew Perish


	
	Andrew Perish did not give evidence. He sought to show through cross-examination of Witness A and Witness B particularly, that he had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the conspiracy to murder the deceased. He called two of his brothers to give evidence to rebut the evidence of Witness B and Witness A.
	
	
	Matthew Perish, the brother of Anthony and Andrew Perish, gave evidence that he did not recall ever attending a meeting in about October 2006 involving his parents, his brothers Anthony, Andrew and Daniel, Witness B and a solicitor named Monika Mellar. He had not attended a meeting involving those persons where Anthony Perish or any of his brothers had touched their nose and said words like, “This cunt has been talking”.
	
	
	In cross-examination by the Crown he said he had heard of a person called Nosey. Other than over the last couple of days, he had not heard his name for about twenty years. The last time he saw Witness B in the company of his parents and brothers was about twenty years before and the last time he saw Witness B was about ten years before. When asked if he recalled a meeting in October 2006 with some, but not all of the people mentioned, he said he had seen Anthony once in 2006 and had not seen Anthony and Andrew together for the previous five years.
	
	
	Daniel Perish did not know Witness A but knew of a man called Nosey. He did not recall meeting him. He denied that in 2001 he gave Witness A $3,000 in cash. At the time he was living in Hoxton Park or Rossmore. He denied that he had ever attended a meeting involving his parents, his brothers Anthony, Andrew and Matthew, Witness B and a solicitor named Monika Mellar where Anthony touched his nose and said words like, “This cunt has been talking”. The last time he saw Witness B was about four years before. He had not seen him very often back in 2001. He had met Monika Mellar. He thought that in 2006 she was studying to become a lawyer.
	
	
	In cross-examination by the Crown, he agreed that in 2001 he worked at Diesel Dan’s, and was in regular contact with his brother Andrew. He did not recall receiving two telephone calls on 29 October 2001 at 9.51 and 9.54 or that it was at about that time that Andrew came to his house with Witness A. He denied that in late 2001 Andrew came to his house to collect some money.
	
	
	Monika Mellar was a family friend but Daniel Perish did not know for how long she had been a family friend. He had only seen her a handful of times in his life and did not remember her further back than ten years before.
	
	
	He knew that Witness B shared a house with Anthony in 2006 or 2007. He had never met Witness E and was not aware he was a good friend of Anthony’s. He had heard that Witness A’s nickname was Nosey and knew that from growing up in Leppington. He believed Witness A had some association with the local motorcycle club. Daniel himself did not have an association with any motorcycle club.
	
	
	Daniel had remained in contact with all of his family and was close to all of his family members.
	


Mr Anthony Perish – Conviction appeal


	
	Mr Anthony Perish (who for convenience in this section of the judgment we will call the first appellant) raises three grounds of appeal. The grounds are as follows:
	


“1.   A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the admission of the evidence of witness C that witness E told him that the applicant told witness E that ‘it didn’t matter [that the deceased had died before he got to the applicant as] that’s how he would have ended up anyway’.

1A.   The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury with respect to the evidence of witness C that witness E told him that ‘it didn’t matter [that the deceased had died before he got to the applicant as] that’s how he would have ended up anyway’, such that, as a result of the directions, the evidence was available to the jury as evidence of an admission by the applicant.

3.   The verdicts of the jury are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.”


	
	There was no appeal against the sentence imposed.
	


Grounds 1 and 1A


	
	Grounds 1 and 1A are related and it is convenient to deal with them together.
	
	
	To understand these grounds it is necessary to have some regard to the manner in which the case was conducted by the first appellant. The first appellant did not dispute that he participated in an arrangement for Witness E, amongst others, to abduct the deceased and that the deceased was at risk of harm in the carrying out of this enterprise. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on that basis.
	
	
	The first appellant submitted that a critical issue in the appeal was whether the deceased was alive at the time when Witness E’s vehicle arrived at Turramurra. We have pointed to the evidence of Witness E in his ERISP at [128]-[149] above. Relevantly, this evidence, if accepted, established first, that the first appellant requested that Witness E abduct the deceased, bring him for questioning and thereafter return him to prison. It would also establish that the deceased was alive when Witness E’s vehicle arrived at Turramurra, that the first defendant assaulted him and that thereafter the deceased was driven to Girvan.
	
	
	As we also pointed out, in his evidence at trial, Witness E said that at Turramurra he thought the deceased was alive, he recalled that he was in the back coughing. He also stated he could not recall having a conversation with the first appellant during the course of which a decision was made to kidnap the deceased and ask him some questions. He denied that when he left Turramurra he knew the deceased was dead. As we pointed out at [167] above, he could not recall telling Witness C that he had hit the deceased too hard and killed him.
	
	
	The first appellant thus contended that a critical issue in the proceedings was whether the deceased was alive at the time he arrived at Turramurra. If the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive at that time, it would be necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was always the intention of the first appellant that the deceased was to be killed.
	
	
	In this context, the first appellant pointed out that Witness E had a strong motive for maintaining the deceased was still alive when he delivered him to Turramurra, namely to avoid liability for the murder. He pointed out that in sentencing, the trial judge was unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was the alive when he reached Turramurra.
	
	
	It is against this background that the evidence the subject of Grounds 1 and 1A of the appeal fall to be considered.
	
	
	Witness C gave evidence that he was told by Witness E about the abduction. He then gave evidence of a conversation with Witness E in which Witness E stated that the reason the deceased was abducted was because the first appellant believed that the deceased and another gentleman had murdered his grandparents. In further questioning concerning this conversation, Witness C gave the following evidence:
	


“Q.   Was there any further conversation about the episode other than that?

A.   He also relayed that he was concerned at the time that [the applicant] was going to be, he was going to be in trouble with [the applicant] because Falconer had got to [the applicant] but he died before he got to him and [witness E] went on to say that [the applicant] said that it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway.”


	
	The Crown addressed on the evidence making the following remarks:
	


“Now the question of whether he was alive or dead at Turramurra matters not to the Crown, for the reason I indicated to you ladies and gentlemen, because the Crown says to you there was an intention to kill this man all along, and that the act, or acts, whatever they were, that caused his death were caused whilst there was on foot an intention to kill him, and that is murder, but I do want to examine this question because you would have to look for evidence to support as a foundation to support the proposition that Mr Falconer was dead by the time he got to Turramurra. In support of that proposition there is only this: First, well after the event Witness E saying to Witness H something along the lines of, ‘He got a bit lippy and he was mouthing off and being smart so I went up and chopped his head off’. That didn’t happen at Turramurra anyway. Further, ‘He was going to rat on us, and he had to go’. That is what he told Witness H. What he told Witness C was, ‘I hit him too hard and he died, but it didn’t matter, that would have happened anyway’. Witness E gave an explanation for giving varying tales, varying accounts to each of those witnesses in his record of interview, and I have already read this to you but whilst we’re dealing with this particular island of evidence I will remind you of it. He said: ‘There is one thing I should add probably before being questioned … broken neck, and it was all an accident’.

Now you can infer from that that firstly [Witness H] and Craig were only told that part of the plan that had to involve them, the abduction, because Witness E purports to say that he had to explain to them why it was, a man they had been involved in abducting, was then dead. But as an extension of the explanation he gives for giving those varying stories in his interview, he said this in his evidence to you when he was being cross-examined at 1157, line 6:

‘Q.   And you might have implicated yourself … the reason.’

Now as chilling as it may be, what Witness E is saying is that he deliberately fed some misinformation to each of those individuals because if any one of them were to roll, he would be able to identify who was the source of the particular piece of misinformation. So that again is part of that window into another society that when you think it through you can see what Witness E is saying. Well, you feed a bit of this misinformation here, you feed a bit of misinformation there, and if someone rolls, you would be able to track it back. So you have got to take that into account when you consider the proposition that Falconer was dead before he got to Turramurra on the basis of things that Witness E said to Witness H and Witness C’s [sic]. It’s not much of a foundation.”


	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant who appeared at the trial (trial counsel) also addressed on the evidence:
	


“So what do you make of Witness E’s evidence? His Honour will give you some directions about the approach that you must take in relation to assessing believability and his credibility, but at the foundation of it in my submission is the fact that he is inherently unreliable, because he was trying to give a version of the facts that gave him least responsibility, and that that act that you saw, the crying, the performance that he gave, is not inconsistent with the performance that he gave here. That performance which, as Mr Hanley has pointed out to you, meant that those representing the accused, particularly Anthony Perish and Matthew Lawton, couldn’t cross-examine him, couldn’t challenge or test his version of events, because his answer to everything was, ‘I don’t remember’.

But one thing he could remember and he insisted upon was that Mr Falconer was still alive at Turramurra. Because he knew that if Mr Falconer was still alive at Turramurra, then his responsibility for the death went away, he could blame it on other people, but if Mr Falconer was dead at Turramurra, then he bore responsibility, not alone, but with others for that death; with Anthony Perish at least.

But he is spreading responsibility for these things to Anthony Perish. What does he do? He implicates Witness C. He says Witness C knew all about this plan before it happened. That Anthony Perish approached Witness C and talked about this plan to abduct Terry Falconer long before it happened. And of course he gives us his reason for becoming involved in it is this hundred thousand dollars that he claims Witness C borrowed from Anthony Perish, of which he was given 30,000, and he owed this debt. What does Witness C say? No he never borrowed a hundred thousand dollars from Anthony Perish, and no he knew nothing about this plan until after Mr Falconer had been abducted.

So again, that it is the spreading of the blame. It’s not just me, he knew about it too. The reason I did it was because I owed money, and I had to pay off the debt. All those things. But the real truth of what happened you might think comes from the things that he told other people after the event. Why would he tell somebody that he had been the cause of the death if that wasn’t so? Why would he tell Witness H? Why would he tell Witness C?

Witness H, he had to go. He was going to rat on us. He was not giving me the answers that he wanted so I chopped his head off. That is what he told Witness H. Not it was a terrible accident, wasn’t meant to happen. That’s what he told him happened. But more importantly Witness C, there was a struggle in the backseat, I hit him too hard and he died. That was the first version.

Then a few days later Witness C saw him again, and he was told by Witness E that in my submission to you was the most telling piece of admission by Witness E at all. He was dead before he got to Steve, and he couldn’t question him. He was dead before he got to Steve. Because he was concerned that he would be in trouble. He was explaining to [Witness C] what had happened, that he was dead before he got to Steve, and he couldn’t question him.

What does that mean, he was dead before he got to Turramurra? That is what he told him. He then went onto [sic] throw in the line oh, but Steve said that okay because he was going to die anyway. He never said that to police. And you will have to approach that with great caution because I have to say Witness E doesn’t attribute that to Mr Perish, that is what Witness C remembers him saying. He was concerned about being in trouble with Mr Perish because the whole point to the exercise had been lost because he was dead before he got him to Steve.”


	
	The trial judge repeated the evidence in his summing up and gave the jury the following direction in respect of it (substituting the pseudonyms used for Witnesses C and E with their actual names, which were used in the directions):
	


“Members of the jury, [Witness C’s] evidence that [Witness E] told him that Steve said that it didn’t matter ‘that’s how he would have ended up any way [sic]’ is hearsay. And, as I have said, the law considers that it may be unreliable. I warn you, you should treat this evidence with care and caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. Once again, as a matter of common sense, you might think that if a person is being talked about in a conversation and he is not there at the time he is unable to say ‘hang on, that’s not true’. The conversation occurred some time ago and [Witness C] may not have accurately recalled it. Once again I am not suggesting that this evidence of [Witness C’s] must be regarded as unreliable. Whether you accept the evidence and what weight you attach to it is a matter for you.”


	
	There was no objection either to the admissibility of the evidence or the direction given by the trial judge.
	


The first appellant’s submissions


	
	The first appellant submitted that the evidence of Witness C contained a representation that the first appellant had told Witness E that the deceased was going to end up dead anyway. He submitted this evidence was second hand hearsay and not admissible under any of the exceptions to s 59 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act).
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant submitted that the significance of the evidence lay in the fact that there were two significant strands of evidence: that of Witness A and that of Witness E. He pointed out that the evidence of Witness A was significant to the Crown case because he gave evidence that established a pre-existing intention to kill the deceased, however, he was not involved in the events leading up to the deceased’s death.
	
	
	Senior counsel pointed to the fact that Witness E gave evidence that the original plan was to abduct the deceased and return him to Silverwater. He pointed out that Witness E ultimately gave evidence consistent with there being an intention to kill, referring to the evidence of the first appellant’s assault on the deceased and the placement of him back in the box for a number of hours. He submitted that the difficulty with that evidence was that it was dependent upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive when he arrived at Turramurra.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant submitted that by contrast the hearsay evidence the subject of this ground of appeal suggested it was always intended the deceased was going to be killed. He described it as a crossover between the two bodies of evidence and thus powerful evidence in favour of the Crown.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant accepted that the evidence was admitted without objection. In that context he made two submissions. First, to the extent that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules had any application, the admission of the evidence gave rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice. Second, he submitted that notwithstanding its admission, it was not available to prove the truth of the representation complained of. In this context, he submitted that the direction of the trial judge, which at least impliedly accepted that the evidence was admissible to prove the truth of the representation said to have been made by the first appellant, was erroneous. He submitted this gave rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice such that r 4 applied.
	
	
	The first appellant filed an affidavit by trial counsel. It is convenient to set out the relevant paragraphs of that affidavit in full:
	


“3.   I recall that a critical issue in the applicant’s trial was whether the deceased was still alive when he arrived at Turramurra. In this regard it was an important part of the applicant’s case to establish that the deceased was already dead by this time, or at least there was a reasonable possibility that this was so.

4.   I have, in the course of preparing this affidavit been reminded that Witness E gave his evidence before Witness C. Prior to witness C giving evidence I anticipated that he would give evidence of a conversation he had with Witness E. I cross-examined witness E on the basis of the evidence I anticipated that witness C could give. In particular I have been shown the transcript of my cross-examination of witness C at T1216.39ff where I put the following to witness C:

Q. What I want to suggest to you is that after the event, in one of the conversations you had with witness, when you were telling him what happened, you said to him that you thought you were going to be in trouble with Steve – that was a name that Anthony Perish used, wasn’t it?

A. Yeah, I remember that.

Q. Because Falconer was dead before he got him?

A. I don’t recall having a conversation with [Witness C], what the content was, but – I would have had a conversation with him, but I can’t comment on what was said. I can’t comment on whether that’s true or not.

Q. And one of the other things that you said to Witness C was that: ‘I really fucked up there. He was only supposed to be taken to somebody else. I fucked up?

A. I can’t remember the content of the conversation. I would definitely have had a conversation with him.

5.   I asked the above questions as the statements made by Witness E to Witness C (on the expected evidence of Witness C) were inconsistent with Witness E’s evidence including the evidence in his recorded interview. As noted above, I wanted to discredit Witness E’s evidence that the deceased was still alive when he reached Turramurra.

6.   When C gave evidence I was of the view that it was important to prove the prior inconsistent statement that I had put to witness E. I am aware that the following evidence was given by witness C in his evidence in chief (at T1273.18):

Q. Was there any further conversation about the episode other than that?

A. He relayed that he was concerned at the time that Steve was going to be, he was going to be in trouble with Steve because Falconer had got to Steve but he died before he got to him and [Witness E] went on to say that Steve said it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway.

7.   At the time witness C gave evidence I was aware he was likely to give the above evidence having regard to the evidence he gave at committal. I did not turn my mind to the fact that the evidence ‘it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway’ was second hand hearsay and may have been rejected had I objected to it.

8.   I was of the view that the representation ‘Steve said it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway’ was damaging to the applicant’s case. However I did not object to this part of the evidence as I was of the view that in order to have the first part of the conversation, that is the statement: ‘he was concerned at the time that Steve was going to be, he was going to be in trouble with Steve because Falconer had got to Steve but he died before he got to him’ I had to accept the second part of the conversation would be admitted.

9.   Thus, whilst I was of the view that the statement attributed to the applicant ‘it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway’ was damaging to his case, it was my forensic decision that I was prepared to have that evidence in if it meant that the evidence that Witness E had previously made a statement that the deceased was dead at Turramurra would also be admitted.

10.   I am aware that in cross-examining witness C, I asked him questions (at T1282) with respect [to] the utterance that the deceased was already dead before he got to the applicant but did not ask any questions in relation to the utterance ‘Steve said it didn’t matter, that’s how he would have ended up anyway’. This was because I wanted to highlight the helpful part of this evidence and not the damaging part.”


	
	The first appellant contended that if, objectively speaking, the decision to not object to the evidence was not a rational forensic decision, the only question which remained was whether the first appellant had lost the chance of an acquittal.
	
	
	In that context, senior counsel for the first appellant submitted that the evidence in question contained three representations. First, Witness E told Witness C that the deceased was dead before he got to the first appellant. Second, Witness E told Witness C that he was worried as to the first appellant’s reaction to that fact and third, that Witness E told Witness C that the first appellant told him the deceased was going to end up dead anyway.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant submitted that the first two representations were admissible but the third was not. He submitted it was not a rational forensic decision not to object to the third representation. For the reasons indicated above, he also contended that the admission into evidence of the third representation constituted a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	In support of this proposition, senior counsel for the first appellant referred to the cross-examination on this topic by trial counsel. He submitted that the cross-examination of each of Witnesses C and E avoided any examination on what we have described as the third representation. He submitted this showed that the admission of the unfavourable portion of the communication could not be justified as a rational forensic choice.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for the first appellant also submitted that irrespective of whether the evidence was not objected to, it had no probative force. This was because, even after admission, the effect of s 59 of the Act was that the evidence was not admissible to prove that the first appellant had stated that the deceased would end up dead. Thus, he said, it had no relevance and the trial judge erred in effectively directing the jury that they could take it into account. He also submitted, referring to Poniris v The Queen [2014] NSWCCA 100 (Poniris) at [49] that where, as in this case, the danger of unfair prejudice was manifest there was an obligation on the trial judge to exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Act as part of his or her continuing obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law. He submitted that the trial judge should have at least directed the jury that they could not take account of the evidence. In that context, he accepted that r 4 applied but submitted there was a substantial miscarriage of justice in the direction given.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant accepted that trial counsel was aware of s 59 of the Act and the manner it was interpreted in Lee v The Queen [1998] HCA 60; 195 CLR 594 (Lee) but submitted that this did not alter the fact that s 59 applied to the evidence. He also submitted the evidence was irrelevant to Witness E’s credit.
	


The Crown submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that hearsay evidence (not falling within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule) was inadmissible over objection. It was submitted that no objection was taken to the evidence, which was similar to that which previously had been given at the committal hearing. It was also submitted that the Crown did not rely on the evidence as truth of the representation and, by contrast, the first appellant sought to take advantage of the conversation generally. In those circumstances, it was submitted there was no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, referring to portions of the trial counsel’s address to which we have referred at [228] above, that it did not seek to use the evidence as truth of the representation but that by contrast trial counsel embraced what was described as the misinformation evidence and urged the jury to use it as an indication of Witness E’s unreliability.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, subject to ensuring a fair trial according to law, there is no obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence to which no objection was taken and that it was well recognised that the words not admissible when used in the Act are to be construed as meaning “not admissible over objection”. The Crown pointed to the fact that the Act operates within an adversarial context. It was submitted that the first appellant made a legitimate forensic choice to make use of the evidence and that this was not a case where there was a manifest danger of unfair prejudice, such as to require the trial judge to reject the evidence of his own motion.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown pointed to argument at the trial in respect of the ERISP given by Witness E, where trial counsel had argued that certain portions of it were not admissible, relying on Lee. She contended that it was clear that trial counsel would have been aware that the evidence was inadmissible but made a deliberate decision not to object to it. Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that this occurred in circumstances where trial counsel was aware from what occurred at the committal hearing that Witness C was going to give the evidence in question.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the key to understanding the significance of the evidence was to appreciate its relationship to Witness E’s “misinformation strategy”. She pointed to the fact that in his ERISP, Witness E stated that the deceased was alive when he arrived at Turramurra and died en route to Girvan. She also pointed to evidence where Witness E stated that, in order to keep tabs on other members of his team and to trace the leaking of information concerning the abduction, he told different persons different things. She submitted a key aspect in the proceedings was the timing of the deceased’s death which was why it was important to the first appellant that Witness E be discredited on this issue, particularly having regard to his defence to the effect that he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to kidnap the deceased, anticipated that force might be used and was an active participant in the disposal of the body but had no intention to kill the deceased.
	
	
	So far as Ground 1A was concerned, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that inadmissible in s 59 of the Act meant inadmissible over objection and that the proposition that even after admission it could not support the hearsay representation was contrary to authority.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions on Ground 1A, filed after the conclusion of the hearing, the Crown accepted that the evidence was second hand hearsay and thus did not fall within the exception to the hearsay rule contained in s 60(1) by virtue of s 60(3) and that the admission was not admissible under s 81 as it was not firsthand hearsay.
	
	
	However, the Crown reiterated its submission that the evidence was relevant for a non-hearsay purpose, namely to attack the credit of Witness E on the basis that what he told Witness C was different to what he told the police. The Crown pointed out that the impugned statement was the last part of a conversation in which Witness E told Witness C the deceased was dead when he arrived at Turramurra. It was submitted that it was used to attack Witness E’s statements in the ERISP.
	
	
	In relation to the direction complained of, the Crown submitted that when the direction was read in the context of the summing up as a whole, it did not constitute a direction relevant to the first appellant’s state of mind. It submitted that the evidence was not referred to in the course of directions on the issue of state of mind but only in that portion of the directions which dealt with the time and manner of the deceased’s death. It was submitted that a fair reading of the charge to the jury showed that the direction was correct in warning the jury about the use they could properly make of the conversation in assessing the credibility of Witness E. In that context, the Crown contrasted the direction with the two other directions concerning admissions.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that r 4 applied and, as such, it was necessary for the applicant to show that it lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted. It was submitted that, having regard to the approach taken by trial counsel and the trial judge, the risk of impermissible reasoning was negligible. Further, it submitted that the jury could find it was part of Witness E’s misinformation strategy and unlikely to be given any weight. Finally, the Crown submitted there was compelling evidence to support the guilty verdict and in those circumstances alone there was no miscarriage of justice.
	


Consideration


	
	As indicated above, it was common ground that the evidence complained of was not admissible under any of the exceptions to s 59 of the Act, nor as an admission.
	
	
	It is also clear from the affidavit of trial counsel that she made a conscious decision not to object to the evidence. In her affidavit she stated she was aware the evidence in question would be given. Although she stated she did not turn her mind to whether it was second hand hearsay, she stated it was her forensic decision that she was prepared to have that statement in evidence if Witness E’s evidence that he had previously stated the deceased was dead when he arrived at Turramurra would be admitted.
	
	
	In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124, Gaudron J with whom Gummow J agreed, made the following comments on the question of whether decisions made by trial counsel were productive of a miscarriage of justice:
	


“[26]   The question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is usually answered by asking whether the act or omission in question ‘deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open’. The word ‘fairly’ should not be overlooked. A decision to take or refrain from taking a particular course which is explicable on the basis that it has or could have led to a forensic advantage may well have the consequence that a chance of acquittal that might otherwise have been open was not, in the circumstances, fairly open.

[27]   One matter should be noted with respect to the question whether counsel’s conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted or could have resulted in a forensic advantage. That is an objective test. An appellate court does not inquire whether the course taken by counsel was, in fact, taken for the purpose of obtaining a forensic advantage, but only whether it is capable of explanation on that basis.

[28]   As already indicated, if there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the fact that counsel’s conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted or could have resulted in a forensic advantage is not necessarily determinative of the question whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. It may be that, in the circumstances, the forensic advantage is slight in comparison with the importance to be attached to the defect or irregularity in question. If so, the fact that counsel’s conduct is explicable on the basis of forensic advantage will not preclude a court from holding that, nevertheless, there was a miscarriage of justice.”


	
	Her Honour also stated that “an accused will not ordinarily be deprived of a chance of acquittal that is fairly open if that chance is foreclosed by an informed and deliberate decision to pursue or not pursue a particular course at trial”: at [32]. In that context, her Honour made the following remarks:
	


“[33]   Where it is claimed that a miscarriage of justice was the result of a course taken at the trial, it is for the appellant to establish that the course was not the result of an informed and deliberate decision. This he or she will fail to do if the course taken is explicable on the basis that it could have resulted in a forensic advantage unless, in the circumstances, the advantage is slight in comparison with the disadvantage resulting from the course in question. It should be added, moreover, that where the course in question is the failure to call evidence, an appellant will not establish a miscarriage of justice unless, as with fresh evidence, the evidence is such that ‘when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial ... the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused’.”


	
	Hayne J, with whom Gummow J also agreed, expressed the position in the following terms:
	


“[107]   No less importantly, however, it follows from the characteristics of a criminal trial which I have identified that, when it is said that a failure to call evidence which was available to the defence at trial has led to a miscarriage of justice, the question presented to an appellate court requires an objective inquiry, not an inquiry into the subjective thought processes of those who appeared for, or advised, the accused at trial. The relevant question is not: why did counsel not lead the evidence, or was counsel competent or incompetent? It is: could there be any reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence?

[108]   If there could not be any such explanation, there may have been a miscarriage of justice. It would then be necessary to go on to ask whether the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about guilt if the evidence had been led. If, however, there could be a reasonable explanation for not calling the evidence, that will be the end of the matter. It is not to the point then to inquire whether counsel did or did not think about the point, or acted competently or incompetently, even though the conclusion that there could be no reasonable explanation for the course followed at trial would seem to entail the conclusion that counsel did not act competently.

[109]   To hold that the inquiry is not an objective inquiry of the kind I have described would require an appellate court to apply inquisitorial methods and standards in determining an appeal from what, at trial, has been an accusatorial and adversarial process. It would require the appellate court to examine whether, on all the material available, a jury would have been likely to entertain a doubt. That is a very different process from the process undertaken at trial which is predicated upon the parties choosing the field for debate and (subject to the obligations of the prosecution) the evidence that is to be led. The principles which inform the two processes are so radically different that they cannot be applied at successive stages of the judicial process. If they are to be merged in some way, that must occur throughout the system, not by applying one set of principles at trial and another, contrary, set of principles on appeal.”

See also Gleeson CJ at [8]-[16].


	
	In the present case, there was, objectively speaking, a rational basis for not objecting to the evidence. For the reasons we have given in dealing with Ground 3, in our opinion, the Crown case was powerful, even if the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive at the time he arrived at Turramurra. If the jury concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive at that time, the case becomes overwhelming. The first appellant admitted involvement in the kidnapping and the disposal of the body. If it was found the deceased was alive on reaching Turramurra, it is difficult to see how any conclusion other than that the first appellant murdered him could be reached. That is why it was vital to contradict Witness E’s evidence that the deceased was alive at that time. In those circumstances, it was, in our opinion, a rational decision not to object to the unhelpful part of the conversation to ensure Witness E’s prior statement to Witness C, that the deceased was dead when he arrived at Turramurra, was before the jury. This particular piece of evidence was described by trial counsel in her address as “the most telling piece of admission by Witness E at all”.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it does not seem to us that the admission of the evidence meant the first appellant lost the chance of an acquittal fairly open to him. However, even if it could not be said that the decision not to object to the evidence was a rational forensic decision, in our opinion, there was no miscarriage of justice as the first appellant did not in fact lose the chance of an acquittal. It is convenient to deal with that question after dealing with Ground 1A.
	
	
	For the first appellant to succeed on Ground 1A, it is necessary for him to establish two matters: first, that notwithstanding the admission of the evidence it was not available to prove the truth of the representations that the first appellant told Witness E that the deceased would end up dead anyway; second, that the failure to direct the jury to that effect constituted a miscarriage of justice. In that context, the first appellant accepted r 4 applied.
	
	
	There has been a consistent line of authority that the words “not admissible”, where they appear in the Act, mean “not admissible over objection”.
	
	
	R v Reid [1999] NSWCCA 258 (Reid) concerned the then s 424A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which provided that unrecorded admissions by an accused to investigating officers were not admissible except in certain circumstances. Spigelman CJ at [3] noted that s 424A commenced at the same time as the Act. He stated at [5] that “the words ‘is not admissible’ should be construed as meaning ‘is not admissible over objection’”, stating that at the time it enacted the legislation, Parliament was well aware that the usual course in trials under the adversary system requires objection be taken to evidence. Greg James J agreed at [11]. That decision has been followed by this Court on a number of occasions: R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [416]; R v Lyberopoulos [2002] NSWCCA 280 at [41] (where Hulme J, with whom Mason P and Simpson J agreed, described the proposition as “trite law”); R v Kaddour [2005] NSWCCA 303; 156 A Crim R 11 at [62]; Gonzales v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 (Gonzales) at [25]-[26]; WC v The Queen [2015] NSWCCA 52 (WC) at [20].
	
	
	A similar approach has been taken by the Court of Appeal in civil proceedings: Selstam v McGuinness [2000] NSWCA 29; 49 NSWLR 262 at [149]; Gray v Ware Building Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 271 (Gray) at [94].
	
	
	The same conclusion was reached by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v SNF (Australia) Pty Ltd [2011] FCAFC 74 (SNF); 193 FCR 149. In that case, the Court expressed its conclusion in the following terms:
	


“[25]   Even if it were shown that Mr Schlag’s evidence was hearsay and assuming that Mr Schroeter’s was too, it would not follow that the trial judge was disabled from acting upon it once it was admitted into evidence, as it was, without objection. There is, in the Commissioner’s favour, some academic support for the proposition that inadmissible hearsay, even when admitted, continues to have no value. The best arguments were marshalled by Professor W N Harrison in ‘Hearsay admitted without objection’ (1955) 7 Res Jud 58. Reference is made in that article (at 69-70) to Walker v Walker [1937] HCA 44; (1937) 57 CLR 630 which appears to show that a hearsay letter, once placed in evidence, is a legitimate source of probative material. Only Starke J arrived at the contrary conclusion. Of the four judges in the majority on this point, Evatt J (at 638) perhaps put it most clearly: ‘I deny the proposition that, merely because the document was ‘hearsay’ and therefore inadmissible, it is necessarily deprived of probative value.’ Professor Harrison sought to argue that Walker was better understood as a decision dealing with the principle which requires a cross-examiner who calls for a document to place it into evidence but this cannot be correct. Walker deals with both arguments and deals with them separately. So much is clear from the dissenting judgment of Starke J who agreed with the other judges as to the operation of the cross-examination rule (at 635) but disagreed with them about what the status of the document was once it was placed in evidence. That being so, Walker binds this Court to reject the Commissioner’s contention.

[26]   In any event, later commentators have differed from Professor Harrison. Professor Heydon, as his Honour then was, commented that a contrary view to Professor Harrison’s was preferable ‘if only to prevent a large jump in the number of possible appeals based on the hearsay rule’: ‘Current Trends in the Law of Evidence’ (1977) Sydney Law Review 305 at 307 fn 7; an observation having a certain resonance with the present appeal. The same author in the eighth edition of Cross on Evidence observed that ‘the modern authorities appear to have moved beyond the conclusion for which Harrison contended’: at [1680] p 133. In that regard, it is useful to note the conclusion reached by Spigelman CJ in Seltsam Pty Ltd v McGuinness [2000] NSWCA 29 (2000) 49 NSWLR 262 at 247 [149] that the words ‘not admissible’ in the Evidence Act 1995  (NSW) means ‘not admissible over objection’. No principled reason for approaching the meaning of the same words in the statutory embodiment of the hearsay rule (s 59 of the Evidence Act 1995  (Cth)) presents itself; no justification for taking some other course.


	
	These decisions have not been uncontroversial. In Cross on Evidence, the learned author states that the question has been sadly under analysed by both judges and jurists: J D Heydon (10th ed 2015, Lexis Nexis) at [1680]. In Uniform Evidence Law, the learned author describes the proposition in Reid as highly questionable as it failed to take into account the provisions of s 190 of the Act: Stephen Odgers (11th ed 2014, Thomson Reuters) at [1.3.290]. In Velkoski v The Queen [2014] VSCA 121 this criticism was said to have some force but the court did not rule on the issue.
	
	
	There are a number of matters which it may be said suggest a contrary conclusion to that reached in the authorities above. First, the words “not admissible” in s 59 (and other sections of the Act) are not expressly qualified by the words “over objection”. The same words are used in s 56(2) in respect of the inadmissibility of irrelevant evidence. This tends to suggest a contrary conclusion to that reached in the cases to which we have referred.
	
	
	Furthermore, s 190 of the Act deals with waiver of the rules of evidence. As Giles JA recognised in Gonzales at [25], that section lends some further support to a conclusion contrary to that reached in the cases referred to above. However, s 190 deals with waiver of particular provisions of the Act. If as a matter of construction s 59 means inadmissible over objection, failing to object does not constitute any waiver of the provision within the meaning of s 190.
	
	
	The words “not admissible” are to be contrasted against the use of words of prohibition, “shall not be adduced”, in s 118 of the Act and the obligation of the court to refuse to admit evidence if the preconditions in s 137 of the Act are met. (It is unnecessary in these proceedings to form any view as to whether the approach to be taken by the trial judge to his or her obligations under that section are as set out in R v FDP [2008] NSWCCA 317; (2009) 74 NSWLR 645 or R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; 130 A Crim R 44). The different wording does lend support for the view that “admissible” means “admissible over objection”, particularly when viewed in the context that Parliament would have been aware that s 59 would operate in adversarial proceedings, in which generally it is counsel’s responsibility to present their clients’ case and to object to such evidence as they think fit in the interests of their client.
	
	
	We should add that we are not of the view that the decision of the High Court in Walker v Walker [1937] HCA 44; 57 CLR 630 (Walker) provides support for the conclusion reached in the cases to which we have referred: See particularly SNF and Gray at [94]. The issue in Walker was the evidentiary effect of a document which the appellant was required to tender having called for it, a rule abolished by s 35 of the Act. In these circumstances it does not appear to be of assistance in construing the present legislation.
	
	
	Taking these considerations into account, we are not satisfied that the construction of the words “not admissible”, in the cases to which we have referred above, is plainly wrong. Indeed, the better view is that it is correct. We are fortified in reaching this conclusion by two matters. First, the conclusion is consistent with the adversarial nature of a trial, including a criminal trial. The fact that the Act applies in an adversarial context was made plain in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1. In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J made the following remarks:
	


“[20]   Sections 114 and 115, like many other provisions of the Evidence Act, declare that evidence of a certain kind is not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Yet evidence of a kind to which those sections refer may not be the subject of objection. Counsel for an accused person may have any one of a number of reasons for not objecting. A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire. Counsel might decide not to object simply because he or she knows that that accused, upon giving evidence, will admit that the identification evidence is correct. The Evidence Act applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection. It is the duty of the prosecution, in its case, to lead the whole of the evidence to which the accused is required to make answer. It will often appear, in the course of a defence case, that some, perhaps much, of that evidence is not in dispute. In that event, it will be appropriate for a judge to point that out to the jury.”


	
	This statement, particularly the comment that it is for the parties to choose the evidence to which they will take objection, lends support to the conclusion contended for by the Crown.
	
	
	Second, nothing we have said relieves the trial judge from his or her overriding obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at [18]-[20]; James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6; 253 CLR 475 at [24]. To the extent necessary, this obligation would extend to requiring the trial judge on his or her own motion to exclude inadmissible evidence, the effect of which would deny a fair trial, and in other circumstances to direct the jury not to take account of a particular piece of evidence which would have been rejected had objection been taken.
	
	
	In the present case, the admission of the evidence resulted from a rational forensic decision made by trial counsel. In these circumstances, there was no need for the trial judge to intervene to reject its admission.
	
	
	It remains to be considered whether a miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the trial judge to direct that the evidence could not be used as an admission by the first appellant that he intended to kill the deceased. The first appellant accepted r 4 applied and it was necessary for him to show that as a result of the failure to give the direction, the first appellant lost a real chance, or a chance fairly open, of being acquitted: ARS v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148]; Poniris at [59].
	
	
	In the present case, we do not consider the first appellant lost such a chance. The relevant portions of the addresses to the jury have been set out above, as well as the direction by the trial judge. It is important to note that the Crown in its address stated that it was immaterial to the Crown case that the deceased was killed before or after he reached Turramurra. However, the Crown relied on Witness E’s evidence that he was alive when he reached Turramurra but sought to dismiss what Witness C alleged he was told by Witness E, as one of Witness E’s varying accounts given to different people as part of his misinformation strategy. The Crown did not rely on the admission complained of to support the Crown case.
	
	
	Trial counsel advanced the submission that Witness E was inherently unreliable but emphasised that he had told Witness C that the deceased was dead before he reached Turramurra. She emphasised that he did not tell the police that the first appellant said he was going to die anyway and emphasised the care that had to be used in dealing with the hearsay evidence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, when the Crown placed no reliance on the admission and the defence dealt with it in the terms indicated, it does not seem to us that the first appellant was deprived of a real chance of acquittal as a result of the direction by the trial judge, even if it could be said the direction was erroneous. The hearsay evidence of a statement given by a person who both parties contended was unreliable in particular respects, coupled with a caution about its use, leads to the conclusion that the admission would be unlikely to be a significant factor in the jury’s deliberations. It is necessary to consider this question in the context of the case against the first appellant as a whole. This has been dealt with in our consideration of Ground 3. The matters to which we have referred in dealing with that ground show, in our opinion, that the case was strong – discounting the evidence complained of and accepting that there was reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive when he reached Turramurra. In these circumstances, we do not think the admission of the evidence or the direction given by the trial judge deprived the first appellant of a real chance of acquittal.
	
	
	It follows that Grounds 1 and 1A have not been made out.
	


Ground 3

The first appellant’s submissions


	
	The first appellant submitted that the primary issues were, first, whether it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was still alive at the time he reached Turramurra and second, whether the first appellant, prior to the abduction, had the intention to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The first appellant accepted that if the deceased was alive at Turramurra, there was a strong case of murder against him. However, he submitted the case was not strong if the deceased was not alive at that time. He submitted that whilst reckless indifference to life was raised, there was no real case of reckless indifference available. In that context, the first appellant pointed out that he was not present when the relevant decisions concerning the abduction were made and that it was inherently unlikely that he believed the deceased would die as a result of being transported to Turramurra. He submitted that the manner of the abduction indicated an intention to bring him to Turramurra alive. Further, he contended that the need to prove an intention to kill was reflected in the Crown’s address.
	
	
	The first appellant submitted that the trial judge’s finding, contained in his remarks on sentence, to the effect there was a reasonable possibility that the deceased was dead by the time he reached Turramurra, was amply supported by the evidence. He submitted that the evidence of Witness E to the contrary was undermined by a motivation which he had to limit his liability in respect of the killing. He also submitted that the possibility the deceased died before reaching Turramurra was supported by the fact that on a hot day he was locked in a metal box with no air holes for over two hours whilst being transported to Turramurra. He pointed to the evidence of Professor Lyons, a forensic pathologist, who explained it was a possibility that a person under the influence of anaesthetic and positioned in a metal box the same way as the deceased was, would die within two hours.
	
	
	The first appellant also referred to the evidence of Professor Lyons to the effect that the trauma sustained by the deceased was inconsistent with Witness E’s evidence that the appellant had grabbed the deceased’s head and slammed it into the box and rather, was more consistent with injury as a result of a kick or a punch to the face. He submitted this cast further doubt on Witness E’s evidence.
	
	
	The first appellant also referred to other inconsistent accounts given by Witness E as casting doubts on the reliability of his evidence. He referred to the evidence of Witness H to the effect Witness E told him the deceased “had to go” and that he was not giving the answers they wanted so “he chopped [the deceased’s] head off”.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the first appellant submitted, it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was alive at the time he arrived at Turramurra.
	
	
	The first appellant further submitted that the evidence of Witnesses A and E and to a lesser extent Witness B was not a sound basis to establish beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intention to kill the deceased.
	
	
	The first appellant submitted that, with the exception of the evidence the subject of Grounds 1 and 1A, Witness E did not give evidence supporting the existence of an intention on the part of the first appellant to kill the deceased prior to the abduction. He submitted that, to the extent Witness E gave evidence of events after the abduction, once it was accepted there was a reasonable possibility the deceased was dead on arrival at Turramurra, his evidence could not be relied upon in relation to subsequent events.
	
	
	The first appellant disputed the fact that Witness E’s evidence of the first appellant having duct tape and wire to wrap up the body indicated a high degree of planning. Rather, the first appellant contended it was reasonably possible that these items were present in a shed on a country property without prearrangement.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant referred to the evidence of Witness E that white suits were available at the Girvan premises where the dismemberment took place. He said the evidence had to be treated with caution having regard to Witness E’s credibility.
	
	
	The first appellant also pointed to the fact that both Witnesses H and E consistently gave evidence that the abduction of the deceased was for the purpose of questioning him and that he was to be dropped back to work after being questioned.
	
	
	The first appellant submitted it was not possible to rely on Witness A’s evidence to reach a conclusion to the requisite standard. He submitted Witness A was a career criminal and generally disreputable.
	
	
	The first appellant also submitted that throughout his involvement with the police investigation, Witness A reported a number of bizarre incidents which cast doubt on his mental state. We referred to this evidence at [65]-[66] above. The first appellant submitted these reportings indicated that Witness A was suffering from intense paranoia.
	
	
	However, the first appellant conceded there was a legitimate basis for Witness A’s belief that he was in danger. He had given evidence against the Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle Club and had been stabbed seven times whilst at Lithgow Gaol. He submitted Witness A’s intense fear of being murdered provided him with a powerful motive to obtain police protection.
	
	
	The first appellant also referred to the fact that Witness A’s statement was given after 26 meetings with the police which took place between 29 August 2002 and 8 May 2003 and that his statement was not finalised until 15 July 2003. He submitted, in those circumstances, Witness A had ample time to obtain details of the matter which gave him an opportunity to fabricate a story which would assist the police.
	
	
	The first appellant pointed to a number of other matters which he submitted cast doubt on Witness A’s evidence. First, Witness A initially told the police he was obliged to repay the money given to him by the first appellant to repair the boat, which was inconsistent with the Crown case that the first appellant financed the repairs as part payment for the disposal of the body.
	
	
	Second, the first appellant pointed to the evidence of Witness A concerning the McDowell phone, which he said was given to him by Matthew Lawton (see above at [35]-[38]). He pointed to the evidence of Witness A that, to the best of his knowledge, the phone was delivered a couple of days after the dinner with the first appellant and Mr Andrew Perish at Newtown and to his evidence that he never intended to go through with the plan but rather, was using the McDowell phone to leave a trail which would assist him when police became aware of the enterprise.
	
	
	The first appellant pointed to the fact that the receipt from the company which repaired the boat indicated it was put in for repairs on 12 October 2001, which having regard to Witness A’s evidence, put the Newtown meeting on 11 October 2001. However, he submitted the evidence from Witness A’s phone records established that Witness A was in phone contact with Mr Andrew Perish by 9 October 2001 (see above at [34]). He submitted that this contradicted Witness A’s evidence that he had no contact with Mr Andrew Perish prior to the day of the Newtown meeting. The first appellant also referred to phone records which showed a call made from Witness A’s phone to Anthony Perish originating from Badgery’s Creek at 9.11pm on 11 October, the day of the Newtown dinner. He submitted this cast considerable doubt on whether the Newtown dinner occurred at all.
	
	
	In relation to the McDowell phone, the first appellant submitted the record showed it was not activated, and therefore could not have been used, prior to 29 October 2001. Further, he submitted that following the call which activated the SIM card there were no calls supporting Witness A’s use of the phone. He submitted the McDowell phone thus provided no real support for the evidence of Witness A.
	
	
	The first appellant also pointed to the fact that although Witness A said he went to Newcastle on 31 October solely for the purpose of reconnaissance for the first appellant and did not take the boat, he conceded in cross-examination that he may have in fact taken it. The first appellant submitted that on that basis, the trip was entirely consistent with wanting to take the boat out after repairs.
	
	
	In relation to the proposition that the dismemberment of the deceased took place in the same region of NSW as that referred to by Witness A, the first appellant submitted that Witness A had ample opportunity to weave this into his story.
	
	
	The first appellant also submitted it was unlikely, having invested $8,700 in repairs, that after being unable to contact Witness A on his Mobile 2 phone, no attempt would be made to contact him on his other phones or visit him to inquire as to the status of the boat. He submitted that the sudden end to Witness A’s involvement cast doubt on the question of whether Witness A was involved at all.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the first appellant sought to further attack the evidence of Witness A. He referred to the evidence of Witness A to the effect that his girlfriend, Witness F, was present when $1000 was given to him by a woman named Denise prior to the Newtown meeting (see above at [23]). He pointed out that by contrast, Witness F’s evidence was that she did not see Witness A receiving any money.
	
	
	The first appellant stated that the evidence of Witness B to the effect that a meeting took place between Witness B, Witness E and himself in which he stated “We killed him at [Witness E’s] mother’s property up the coast”, did not advance the matter as it was inconsistent with the fact that the Girvan property had no connection with Witness E and there was no evidence the deceased was killed at the property.
	
	
	The first appellant submitted that the timing of the abduction and, in particular, the fact that it would have been impossible to return the deceased to prison at the allotted time, did not support the inference that there was always an intention to kill him. He submitted there were a number of alternate explanations. First, the abduction took place later than anticipated, second, no thought was given to this issue and third, the deceased would sooner accept the consequence of his late return rather than implicate the first appellant and the other participants.
	
	
	The first appellant made similar submissions as to the question whether an inference could be drawn from the failure of the abductors to wear masks. In particular, he pointed out that in addition to the deceased, the employees at the smash repair business would have seen the abductors. It was thus contended the failure to wear masks was inconsistent with the intention to murder the deceased.
	


The Crown submissions


	
	The Crown emphasised that the Court must not discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility for determining guilt or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The importance of this principle was emphasised in the context of the evidence of Witness A. It was submitted that Witness A had a cogent response to each of the criticisms levelled at him and that his evidence was supported by extrinsic material.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted the trial judge gave the jury all the warnings required by law and directed them that each of Witnesses E and A were potentially unreliable by reason of having been criminally involved in the matters the subject of the proceedings. It was submitted that each of the problems with their evidence identified by the first appellant was raised by trial counsel for the Crown.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that its case was that irrespective of when or how the deceased died; the first appellant always intended that the death would occur. The mode of the disposal of the body changed but the intent was always present.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that it was the Crown case that the deceased died in the furtherance of a joint criminal enterprise in which it was always intended that he be killed. However, the case also envisaged the alternative possibility that the first appellant acted with reckless indifference to human life. It submitted no application was made to the trial judge to suggest that a verdict of guilty on that basis was only available if the jury concluded the deceased was alive when he reached Turramurra.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the first appellant’s submission that Witness E had a motive for minimising his liability overlooked the fact that he had already pleaded guilty and had been sentenced for his part in the offence.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the evidence of Professor Lyons was of no assistance to the first appellant. The Crown referred to the evidence of Witness E to the effect that the appellant told him to handcuff the deceased, anaesthetise him, place him in a metal box and drive him to Turramurra. It was submitted that it could be inferred from that evidence that the applicant intended either to kill the deceased or was recklessly indifferent to his life.
	
	
	In dealing with the inconsistent evidence of Witness E on the question of time of death, the Crown submitted it was open to the jury to conclude that such inconsistency was a result of the misinformation strategy which",2016-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701628,R v Hannah [2016] NSWDC 195,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: For many years the Court of Criminal Appeal has stated, and restated, an important principle when drug suppliers are sentenced - those trafficking to a substantial degree must expect to go to gaol full-time, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The offender, Michael Brian Hannah, was trafficking to a substantial degree and there are no exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	I do note that the principle was laid down before the sentencing option of an intensive corrections order was available. In some cases I have had to consider whether the principle should be modified because of that sentencing option, but this is not such a case. The extent of Mr Hannah’s drug supply activities means that there is no alternative to full-time imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender conducted a roof tiling business. He says that after some April storms, when he was very busy, he began to use drugs so that he could work and supplied drugs to his employees so that they would become more reliable. However, his drug supply activities extended well beyond simply supplying a couple of employees.
	
	
	Between 20 July 2015 and 21 August 2015 the offender supplied methylamphetamine on 45 separate occasions. The total weight of those supplies was 15.2 grams with an estimated street value of $7,600. When his home was searched police discovered a further quantity of methylamphetamine, 25.86 grams, which had a street value of $16,000.
	
	
	The offender was a reasonably enthusiastic supplier too. He had a mobile phone which he used exclusively for drug deals. It was subscribed in a false name. He, of course, had a personal mobile phone which was subscribed in his own name. He developed a code to be used, not a particularly clever one, one that was easily seen through, but in order to aid his drug supplying activities he and his customers did use code words. He was found to be in possession of scales and resealable bags.
	
	
	He had a number of customers. When Mr Hannah gave evidence he was much less than frank initially. It was only in cross-examination that the true extent of his drug dealing activities became apparent. On my estimate, he supplied drugs to two employees and something in the order of six friends, at least one of whom then on-supplied to other people, to the offender’s knowledge.
	
	
	I have to be careful not to breach the rule in De Simoni and so, when I ask the Crown how I do that, I was supplied with the decision of Jadron v R [2015] NSWCCA 217. I note that there is only one charge of supply in this matter, to which the offender has pleaded guilty. He did plead guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	I have spoken about the circumstances in which Mr Hannah began to supply drugs. I do have to say that apart from the matters for which he is to be sentenced today, Mr Hannah has done a lot about which he is entitled to be proud. He has a very good work history; he is a productive person, he is a good family man. Although he used drugs leading up to and at the time of this offence, since his arrest he says he has not used drugs at all. Indeed, were it not for this matter, I could confidently say that Mr Hannah is a man of good character. I make that finding despite Mr Hannah’s difficulty in being frank in the witness box when giving evidence today.
	
	
	Mr Hannah has a criminal history. He was put on two s 9 good behaviour bonds for offences which occurred in the circumstances that Mr Hannah described whilst giving evidence. The presentence report notes that
	
	
	Mr Hannah has responded well with Community Corrections; and took commendable steps to adopt a pro social lifestyle, such that supervision was lifted after 11 months. This reflected his engagement with drug and alcohol services and voluntary involvement in the Rural Fire Service.
	
	
	Thus, Mr Hannah is a person who is able to achieve for himself a great deal of rehabilitation, and, indeed, I am satisfied that he has, once again, rehabilitated himself. He is no longer using drugs and he is back to being a productive worker and the good family man that he was.
	
	
	Of course, there is one qualification to him being a good family man, and that is that a good family man does not commit criminal offences of such seriousness that, when detected, he will go to gaol, which will obviously have an impact on his family. It is one of the terrible things that drugs do that people who use them do not think about the consequences of their actions, do not think about how their actions will affect others whom they love and for whom they should be caring.
	
	
	I note that Mr Hannah also asks that I take into account three matters on a Form 1 when I sentence him. They are an offence of possessing testosterone, possessing cannabis seeds and dealing with property which is suspected to be the proceeds of crime. He had $1,000 on him when he was arrested and about $6,000 discovered in his home. In evidence, Mr Hannah gave evidence which would deny his guilt on the first two matters and deny that the $6,000 in the home was the proceeds of crime, but, despite that, continues to ask me to take those matters into account when I sentence him for the matter on the indictment.
	
	
	I will do that, which means, of course, that I have to ignore the exculpatory evidence that the offender gave. In any case, I fail to see how, when I take into account that Mr Hannah was selling drugs, the fact that he had some of the proceeds of his drug dealing activities in his possession adds anything to his criminality.
	
	
	It was conceded that full-time custody was required because the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree and there were no exceptional circumstances. However, the submission was made that the offender had already spent some 43 days in custody, and the implicit submission was that I could sentence him to imprisonment without requiring him to serve any further time in custody. In my view, that would be inappropriate.
	
	
	There is a substantial need for general deterrence in this case. I have already noted one of the consequences for drug users; drug users become terrible people, they lie and they cheat and they deceive and they forget about others as they go about their daily lives, which, often enough, become exclusively focused on obtaining funds to buy drugs, buying drugs and then using them. It is for that reason that anyone who supplies drugs, as Mr Hannah did, especially someone as enthusiastic as he was, must expect to go to gaol for a substantial period of time. The principles of general deterrence have significant application in this case.
	
	
	I do note that there was a psychiatric report tendered and Mr Hannah has had some challenges over his years, but there was no submission made that there should be any reduction in the need for general deterrence because of the contents of that psychiatric report.
	
	
	I sentence Mr Hannah as follows:
	
	
	A non-parole period of two years, to date from 31 March 2016..I set a head sentence of four years.The non-parole period expires, thus, on 30 March 2018, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	I note that matters on the s 166 certificate are withdrawn, thank you.

		01 September 2016",2016-05-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701633,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 51) [2016] NSWSC 626,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	The Crown has indicated an intention to seek to lead a case in reply at the close of the case for the accused Rogerson (which, as I understand it, will be at the conclusion of his re-examination.)
	
	
	As things presently stand, the Crown's case in reply has two aspects, only one of which is presently in dispute. There may be a third aspect in respect of which I may have to rule at some time in the not too distant future. The present issue arises in this way.
	
	
	In the course of his evidence-in-chief, McNamara gave evidence of a number of matters concerning a white Falcon motor vehicle, registration number BV67PX, which has assumed some significance in the trial. There is clearly a dispute between the two accused as to the circumstances in which that vehicle was acquired, and by whom. However there is no dispute that on 20 May 2014 the vehicle was used by McNamara to transport the deceased from Arab Road, Padstow to storage unit 803 at Rent-a-Space. There is also no dispute that the vehicle was used to transport the deceased's body from storage unit 803 to McNamara's premises at Cronulla.
	
	
	In the course of his evidence-in-chief McNamara said that on or about 14 May 2014 Rogerson had said to him that he did not wish to leave the vehicle in Padstow. It was McNamara's evidence (commencing at T3122 L20) that at that time Rogerson asked for the vehicle to be left at Cronulla. McNamara said that he told Rogerson that the vehicle could be left at Cronulla whereupon he asked Rogerson whether or not it could be used ""to take (his) stuff to the tip"". McNamara said Rogerson agreed, following which the car was driven to Cronulla by Rogerson where he met McNamara. McNamara then drove Rogerson back to his home at Padstow and then drove the car back to Cronulla.
	
	
	Having given that evidence, McNamara was asked (at T3122 L28):
	


“Q. After you used the car or did you use the car to take stuff to the tip?

A. Yes.”


	
	When asked (at T3122 L47) where the car remained after that (i.e. where it remained after it had been used to take material to the tip) McNamara replied that there was an area in North Cronulla without timed parking within which he parked the vehicle. He indicated that the vehicle remained in North Cronulla, and that he parked it in various streets in that area.
	
	
	The unequivocal effect of McNamara's evidence was that at some time after 14 May 2014 the vehicle had been used by him to take material to a local tip, after which it had been parked in various areas in the vicinity of North Cronulla leading up to 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Some days later McNamara was cross-examined by counsel for Rogerson in relation to this issue. It is evident from some of the questions asked in cross-examination that during the period between McNamara’s evidence-in-chief and the cross-examination to which I am about to refer, police obtained a statement from Kim Ross, who is employed as a Landfill Manager by a company who operates recycling centres at Lucas Heights (a site formerly known as the Menai Tip) and at Rockdale.
	
	
	Although the precise content of the statement of that witness was not apparent at the time that McNamara was cross-examined by Mr Thomas, it is now clear that it contains evidence that at no stage between 1 April 2014 and 1 June 2014 was the vehicle BV67PX registered as entering either the Rockdale or the Lucas Heights recycling centre.
	
	
	When this was put to McNamara in cross-examination, he maintained initially (at T3378 L32) that he had ""been having difficulty understanding longer questions"". It was put to him (at T3378 L43) that the evidence he had given concerning the use of the Falcon to take material to the tip was a complete fabrication. He denied that this was the case. Ultimately however, he accepted that he became aware at some stage after giving evidence-in-chief that the Crown had obtained the statement of Kim Ross to which I previously referred.
	
	
	Having asserted in cross-examination (at T3382 L36) that it was ""(his) intention to go to the tip"", he eventually agreed that he had never used the white Falcon to go to the tip. That, for reasons which will be obvious, was diametrically opposed to the position he had adopted in his evidence-in-chief.
	
	
	McNamara was cross-examined by the Crown in relation to the same topic. He agreed (at T3907 L9) that there was a tip (or tips) in his local area around Cronulla, specifically at Lucas Heights and at Rockdale. He also agreed (at T3907 L19) that between 15 April 2016 (when he was giving evidence-in-chief) and 21 April 2016 (when he was being cross-examined by Mr Thomas) he became aware that a search of those facilities had been conducted by the police, and that the evidence to which I referred in the form of the statement of Mr Ross had become available.
	
	
	It is against that background the Crown now seeks to lead the evidence contained in the statement of Mr Ross. The essence of that evidence is, as I have said, that there is no record of vehicle BV67PX entering either the facility at Menai or the facility at Rockdale between April and June of 2014.
	
	
	The Crown submits the evidence is clearly relevant in light of the evidence given by McNamara, both in evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination. The Crown submitted that the evidence is probative of what was, in the Crown's submission, clearly an untruth told by McNamara in the course of his evidence. The Crown submitted that the evidence was also relevant to, and probative of, why the vehicle was in the Cronulla area in the first place.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, supported the Crown's position. He also pointed out, in my view with some force, that in circumstances where some reference has been made in the course of cross-examination to the fact that the Crown has obtained this evidence, it ought be before the jury in its fullest form.
	
	
	Mr Wendler, on behalf of McNamara, objected to the evidence. He submitted that it amounted, in effect, to calling evidence in order to establish something that had already been conceded by McNamara. He also pointed out that if the evidence were excluded, neither the Crown nor Mr Thomas would be precluded from making such submissions to the jury about it and that this was the appropriate way in which to deal with the issue.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submitted, ultimately, that the matter was essentially one for the application of s. 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) on the basis that leading the evidence would amount to an exercise in what he described as “time-wasting”.
	
	
	It is not suggested that the occasion for seeking to call this evidence could reasonably have been foreseen by the Crown. Mr Wendler accepted, as I understood it, that the issue only arose as a consequence of the evidence given in in-chief by McNamara: R v Chin [1985] HCA 35; (1985) 157 CLR 671. The issue, therefore, is whether the evidence is relevant and, if so, whether there is some basis upon which it ought be excluded.
	
	
	In my view the evidence is clearly relevant and highly probative. It is relevant to the assessment of the evidence given by McNamara. It is also relevant to the broader question of the circumstances in which McNamara came to have the vehicle BV67PX under his control in the period leading up to the deceased's death, and how he came to be driving it on 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Accepting this to be the case, the issue is whether or not the evidence ought be excluded. Although Mr Wendler made reference to s. 135 of the Act, because this evidence is sought to be adduced by the prosecution the first provision that ought be considered is s. 137.
	
	
	Section 137 mandates the exclusion of evidence in circumstances where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In my view, for the reasons I have stated, the probative value of this evidence is high. It is certainly prejudicial to the accused, but it is not unfairly so, particularly given the evidence he gave in answer to questions from his own counsel. In my view, this is not a situation where the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. There is nothing to warrant its exclusion under s. 137.
	
	
	Section 135, to which Mr Wendler referred, confers a discretion to exclude evidence in certain circumstances. However for the reasons I have already expressed, I am not satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to McNamara.
	
	
	Moreover, and in light of one specific matter to which Mr Wendler referred, I am certainly not satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger it might cause, or result in, an undue waste of time (s. 135(c)). It will be apparent that the evidence is in very short compass and will be led in a succinct fashion through the officer-in-charge.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to allow the Crown to adduce that evidence in its case in reply.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701637,New South Wales Crime Commission v Richards [2016] NSWSC 838,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 13 May 2016, the plaintiff seeks various orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act). All references to statutory provisions in these reasons are references to the Act unless otherwise stated.
	
	
	The summons sought an order pursuant to s 10A restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; orders pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) authorising the examination of the defendant concerning his financial affairs; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all his property as set out in Schedule Two to the summons; and an order pursuant to s 28A that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of his unexplained wealth (the unexplained wealth order).
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the unexplained wealth order, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 13 May 2016.
	


The evidence in support of the application


	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	


Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 May 2016; and

Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and an unexplained wealth order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 10 May 2016 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).

Relevant statutory provisions


	
	Section 10A relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.
	


Consideration


	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 May 2016. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1), deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities (as defined by s 6), namely the supply of a prohibited drug (amphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), which falls within the definition of “serious criminal offence” pursuant to s 6(2)(b).
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He obtained a copy of the District Court file relating to the defendant (2008/12093) which contained documents that showed that:
	



	
	on 5 August 2008 the defendant pleaded guilty to: two offences of supply prohibited drug (28.5g amphetamine; and 700 amphetamine-based pills); and
	
	
	on 8 September 2008 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for these offences of one year and eight months with a non-parole period of one year.
	



	
	Mr Spark also deposed to investigations he has caused to be made into the defendant’s property interests as a result of which he has ascertained that the defendant is the registered proprietor of the properties in items 1 and 2 of Schedule One to the summons, located in Mosman and Redhead respectively, both of which are located in New South Wales. Mr Spark has also ascertained that the defendant is the registered owner of the Toyota utility (item 3 of Schedule One) and a motorcycle (item 4 of Schedule One).
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion and I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with which real estate can be encumbered and motor vehicles transferred (or notifications of disposal backdated), which tends to have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it. Moreover, Mr Spark has inspected records of electronic payments made by the defendant to persons in the United States who may be associated with prohibited drug supply. This is an additional reason for not requiring the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the real property is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, an unexplained wealth order.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff, as set out below.
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to section 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 no person (other than any registered mortgagee dealing with its right to do so under the registered mortgage) is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with any interest in property (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in section 7 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990) of Scott James Richards, including the interest in property in the property specified in Schedule One hereto, except as provided by Orders 2, 3 and 4 below.

	Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and Scott James Richards to apply on three (3) days’ notice.
	
	
	The costs of obtaining these orders shall be costs in the cause.

		21 June 2016",2016-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701641,Humphries v R; Ponfield v R [2016] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:      I agree with Davies and Beech-Jones JJ.   
	
	
	DAVIES and BEECH-JONES JJ:    Mark Humphries and Wade Ponfield (both Applicants for leave to appeal) and Jhy Wilson were tried together on two counts of robbery whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon being a small pistol contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). They were found guilty by the jury and came for sentence before his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court on 15 September 2014. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The sentencing exercise was not a straightforward one because each of the offenders was serving another sentence at the time each was sentenced for these two armed robberies.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Humphries he had been sentenced in the District Court on 4 July 2014 for an aggravated break, enter and steal committed in July 2009. That sentence was a period of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years six months commencing 19 October 2011 and expiring 17 April 2015 with a balance of term of two years and six months expiring 18 October 2017.
	
	
	For the two counts of armed robbery Judge Arnott sentenced him to concurrent sentences of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of five years commencing 19 October 2013 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and six months expiring 18 April 2021. By backdating the sentence as his Honour did the effective sentence for the two counts of armed robbery was a non-parole period of three years and six months with a balance of term of two years and six months. His overall sentence was seven years and six months. Mr Humphries was on bail for the aggravated break, enter and steal at the time of the commission of the present offences.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Ponfield he had been sentenced in Goulburn Local Court on 23 May 2012 (the Sentencing Judge incorrectly said 14 May 2012) for being carried in a conveyance without consent. He was sentenced to a non-parole period commencing 14 May 2012 and expiring 13 April 2013 with a balance of term expiring 13 August 2013. He had also been sentenced in Wollongong Local Court on 17 July 2012 (the Sentencing Judge incorrectly said 16 May 2012) for drive while disqualified. He was sentenced to a non-parole period commencing 3 July 2012 and expiring 2 February 2013 with a balance of term expiring 2 May 2013. The armed robberies were committed whilst he was on parole for those offences. As a result his parole was revoked.
	
	
	For the armed robberies he was sentenced by Judge Arnott to concurrent sentences consisting of a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing 19 June 2013 (the day of his arrest) and expiring 18 March 2017 with a balance of term of two years and three months expiring 18 June 2019. His overall sentence was six years imprisonment. By backdating the sentence as he did the effective sentence for the armed robberies was three years and seven months with a balance of term of two years and three months.
	
	
	The co-offender Wilson had been sentenced on 27 August 2010 in the District Court for two aggravated robberies committed on 14 February 2009. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing 18 September 2009 and expiring 17 March 2013 with a balance of term of one year expiring 17 March 2014. He was on parole for those offences at the time of the present offences. His parole was also revoked.
	
	
	Judge Arnott then sentenced him for the two armed robberies to a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing 19 June 2013 and expiring 18 December 2016 with an additional term of four years expiring 18 December 2020. His overall sentence was seven years and six months. However, his Honour backdated the sentence to the time of Mr Wilson’s arrest on 19 June 2013 which was the date of his revoked parole. The result of that was an effective sentence for the present offences of a non-parole period of two years and six months with an additional term of four years. This was because his parole period in respect of the earlier offences did not expire until 5 May 2014.
	
	
	Each of Mr Humphries and Mr Ponfield seeks leave to appeal on a parity ground. In Mr Humphries case the ground is:
	


The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to his sentence because in nett terms it is approximately one year longer than the co-offender Wilson contrary to the learned Sentencing Judge’s stated purpose.


	
	In Mr Ponfield’s case the ground is:
	


The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity been the non-parole period imposed on him and his co-offenders Humphries and Wilson.


	
	Mr Humphries seeks leave to appeal on a separate ground as follows:
	


The Applicant has been sentenced on the basis that he was “in company” as an aggravating factor; whereas the fact of being “in company” was already an element of the offence.

Facts concerning the offending


	
	On the late afternoon of Monday 29 April 2013 the three offenders burst through the door of the Steelworks Hotel in Port Kembla and robbed it. Mr Humphries had a pistol and Mr Ponfield had a knife. Ms Virgona was working behind the bar at the time of the robbery and Mr Campbell was the managing supervisor. Apart from them there were about eight to ten patrons in that part of the hotel.
	
	
	Although each offender was convicted of two separate counts, one asserting Ms Virgona was robbed of cash, and the other asserting Mr Campbell was robbed of cash, it involved the one armed holdup of the Steelworks Hotel. The reason for the two counts was because two bundles of cash, having a combined total of about $37,000, were stolen - one from cash drawers and tills just behind the bar in the presence of or in immediate care or protection of Ms Virgona, and the other from a safe in a back office in the presence of Mr Campbell.
	
	
	Mr Ponfield stayed on the customer side of the bar standing guard whilst the other two offenders went behind the bar. At that time Mr Campbell was down in the cellar changing the keg. Entrance to the cellar was through a hatch door in the floor behind the bar. Ms Virgona was serving drinks behind the bar.
	
	
	The robbers behind the bar ordered Ms Virgona to open the cash drawers and till. The gun was pointed at her. They also demanded that she ""get us into the safe"". She told them that she could not get them into the safe and that Mr Campbell was downstairs and would be up soon. As soon as Mr Campbell came up the ladder from the cellar and opened the hatch the gun was pointed at his head. Mr Humphries ordered him to ""take me to the safe"". Mr Campbell led him into the back office where he opened the safe and Mr Humphries grabbed tins containing the money and then took off.
	
	
	Witnesses gave evidence that whilst the offenders behind the bar were scooping the money, Mr Ponfield was getting nervous and had said ""Hurry up"" and he also mentioned ""30 seconds"".
	
	
	The robbery occurred sometime before 5.25pm. It was captured on security CCTV cameras inside the hotel. The robbery took a few minutes. The time of 5.25pm was when Mr Campbell's telephone call to triple-0 was put through to the police. Although the hotel was not busy at that time there were a number of patrons present at the time. Some of them gave evidence in the trial. The pistol used in the robbery was a real one. The Sentencing Judge found it was a real pistol because one of the patrons in the hotel at the time was an experienced firearm handler who identified what type of pistol he believed it to have been.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge found also that the robbery was planned. Not only did the robbers come armed, they wore balaclavas covering their faces, and in the case of Mr Wilson, possibly a mask. Mr Humphries and Mr Wilson travelled down from western Sydney that day specifically to meet up with Mr Ponfield to commit the robbery.
	
	
	At one point during the robbery Mr Wilson's face was uncovered and the rather distinctive angular features of his face were captured on film via CCTV camera.
	
	
	Mr Humphries was arrested on 14 June 2013, and both Mr Ponfield and Mr Wilson were arrested on 19 June 2013.
	


Remarks on Sentence


	
	The Sentencing Judge first noted that the indictment did not allege that the offenders were in company. Each count simply alleged that the particular offender committed the robbery “whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a small pistol”. His Honour said that a weapon could be both an offensive and a dangerous weapon, and because the small pistol was pleaded as a dangerous weapon it brought the count under the provisions of s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	His Honour found that the offenders committed the offences in company with each other and that this was an aggravating factor.
	
	
	His Honour then went on to consider the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and made a comparison of the facts in the present case with the matters discussed in Henry. The distinctions mentioned by his Honour were that there was not a limited degree of planning in the present case, that what was taken being $37,000 was more than a small amount, that no plea of guilty was entered and that none of the offenders could be described as ""young with no or little criminal history”.
	
	
	His Honour considered that the pointing of the pistol at both Ms Virgona and Mr Campbell was an aggravating factor. His Honour considered that there was no distinction amongst the roles of the three offenders.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge then considered the subjective features pertaining to each of the offenders. Because of the limited grounds of appeal it is not necessary to detail these subjective matters. It is sufficient to note that each of the offenders had come from exceedingly deprived backgrounds which had involved early introduction to, and continuing abuse of, illicit drugs. In each case his Honour found that their moral culpability was reduced by reason of the factors set out and that the principles in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; (2012) 249 CLR 571 applied to each of them.
	
	
	Each of the offenders had criminal records back to their teenage years when they were dealt with by the Children’s Court. His Honour found that none of the offenders was contrite or remorseful, that their prospects of rehabilitation were at best guarded or at worst poor, and that there was a risk of reoffending. His Honour thought that considerations of both general and specific deterrence should be given weight.
	
	
	As noted earlier, each of the offenders was on a form of conditional liberty at the time of the robberies. In each case his Honour said that the commission of the present offences whilst on conditional liberty was an aggravating factor. The issue of parity on the appeal arises from the attempt of the Sentencing Judge to impose equal effective sentences on each of the co-offenders whilst accommodating the totality principle.
	


Appeal by Mr Humphries – section 97 Crimes Act

Submissions


	
	Mr Humphries submitted that to be found guilty pursuant to s 97(2) an offender must first be guilty of an offence pursuant to s 97(1). An offence against s 97(2) already incorporates the commission of offences under sub-s (1). It is not incumbent on the Crown to plead which element of sub-s (1) is relied upon. It is sufficient that the facts of the case establish at least one of the sub-s (1) elements. Being in company was one such element.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was open to it to rely upon the pistol as a basis for both the foundational offence and the aggravated offence because it was both an offensive and a dangerous weapon. The definitions in s 4 of the Crimes Act make that clear. The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge was well aware of the manner in which the Crown opened and ran the trial as well as the particulars in the indictment. Being “in company” was not an element relied upon to prove the offence.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 97 of the Crimes Act provides:
	


97   Robbery etc or stopping a mail, being armed or in company

(1)   Whosoever, being armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person,

robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person, or

stops any mail, or vehicle, railway train, or person conveying a mail, with intent to rob, or search the same,

shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty years.

(2)   Aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) when armed with a dangerous weapon. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.

(3)   Alternative verdict

If on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2) the jury is not satisfied that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, but is satisfied on the evidence that the accused is guilty of an offence under subsection (1), it may find the accused not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of the latter offence, and the accused is liable to punishment accordingly.


	
	The indictment read as follows:
	


1.   On 29 April 2013 at Port Kembla in the State of New South Wales did rob Cleo Virgona of a sum of cash, the property of the Steel Works Hotel, whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a small pistol.

Section 97 (2) Crimes Act

….

2.   On 29 April 2013 at Port Kembla in the State of New South Wales did rob Dwayne Campbell of a sum of cash, the property of the Steel Works Hotel, whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a small pistol.


	
	When discussing the seriousness of the offences the Sentencing Judge said this:
	


It should be noted at the outset that the counts in the indictment did not allege that the offenders were in company. Each count simply alleged that the particular offender committed the robbery ""whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a small pistol"". An armed robbery with ""an offensive weapon"" is one contrary to s 97(1). An armed robbery with ""a dangerous weapon"" is one contrary to s 97(2). A weapon can both be an offensive and a dangerous weapon. Because the small pistol was pleaded as a dangerous weapon it brought it under the provisions of s 97(2).

I find the offenders committed the offences in company with each other. Although this was not pleaded, I am entitled to take it into account as an aggravating factor. I also consider the presence of three offender worse than one where only two were present.


	
	The Crown’s submission should be accepted. The pistol was both an offensive and a dangerous weapon. Counsel for Mr Humphries accepted that it could be both. Nothing in the indictment suggested that being in company was the basis for the foundational offence (as the Crown referred to it). Further, it may be accepted that the Sentencing Judge was well aware of how the trial had been run by the Crown. Mr Humphries fails to show on any material from the trial that being in company was the element relied on to ground the s 97(1) foundation for the offence charged.
	
	
	I would reject this ground of appeal.
	


Appeals by both Applicants – parity

Submissions


	
	The Applicants’ arguments essentially pointed to the difference in approach the Sentencing Judge adopted when sentencing Mr Wilson on the one hand and sentencing the Applicants on the other. In the case of Mr Wilson the Applicants submitted that the Sentencing Judge made clear that the approach he was adopting was to lower Mr Wilson’s sentence below what would otherwise be appropriate to take account of the sentence he was already serving. In relation to Mr Ponfield expressly, and in relation to Mr Humphries impliedly, the Sentencing Judge said that he was fully aware that he was sentencing the Applicant on top of an existing sentence.
	
	
	The Applicants submitted that although his Honour had said he intended to bring about an equal result where each of the offenders would serve a non-parole period of about three years and six months, the effect of what was done with Mr Wilson was that he would serve only a non-parole period of about two years and seven and a half months referable to the index offences. That position resulted because Mr Wilson’s non-parole period was backdated to the date on which his revocation of parole was backdated, that is, 19 June 2013.
	
	
	On the part of Mr Humphries, the argument was developed to submit that the imposition of a non-parole period of five years on Mr Humphries when the co-offenders received considerably shorter non-parole periods itself gave rise to a justifiable grievance. Although the five year period was effectively reduced by the backdating this was said to be contrary to the approach stipulated in Pearce. To the extent that this complaint concerned a disparity between his sentence and the sentence imposed on Mr Ponfield it travels beyond his grounds of appeal. Nevertheless no point was taken by the Crown in this respect and we will address it.
	
	
	Mr Ponfield submitted separately that, in any event, his position differed sufficiently from the other offenders so that it was inappropriate for the Sentencing Judge to have aimed to bring about an equal result in the non-parole period. Mr Ponfield was considerably younger than the other offenders and although he had a lengthy criminal record it did not contain the serious offences that Mr Humphries and Mr Wilson had committed, particularly the prior armed robberies committed by Mr Wilson.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the fact that all three offenders had been sentenced by the same Judge who was mindful of the principle of parity and made clear that he was attempting to achieve proportionality between the offenders. That fact meant that this Court would be cautious before concluding that any one offender had a justifiable sense of grievance simply because there were differing sentence outcomes: Lam v R [2014] NSWCCA 50 at [42]; Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91]-[96].
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the way the Sentencing Judge approached Mr Wilson’s sentence resulted in an effective non-parole period that was well below that which could reflect the minimum period of custody to be served having regard to the criminality involved. That created a sentence that was “erroneously lenient”: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [33]. Any reduction in the Applicants’ sentences would be disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the offences.
	


Consideration


	
	The Sentencing Judge was confronted with a difficult task in balancing questions of parity with totality when taking into account sentences being already served. However, all of the offenders were sentenced by the same Judge who was expressly conscious of the parity issue. The Sentencing Judge gave detailed reasons for the sentences imposed after having considered the separate subjective matters relevant to each of the offenders.
	
	
	When sentencing Mr Humphries the Sentencing Judge said this:
	


I might add that, notwithstanding a submission by the Crown that there should be some partial accumulation of the sentences for the two counts for which he was found guilty by the jury, by reason of the fact that there were two separate victims, I consider that the sentence that I have imposed comprehends the criminality involved and is an appropriate sentence.

I propose adopting the same course with Mr Wilson and also with Mr Ponfield.


	
	When sentencing Mr Wilson, the Sentencing Judge said:
	


I consider that Mr Wilson should receive the same effective non-parole period as that imposed upon Mr Humphries. I have come to that view notwithstanding the fact that he has past convictions for armed robbery, the past convictions of both Mr Wilson and Mr Humphries are serious. Because the sentences imposed upon Mr Humphries represented a non-parole period of 3 1/2 years specifically referrable (sic) to the present offences, this is the non-parole period I intend to impose upon Mr Humphries [scil. Mr Wilson].


	
	When sentencing Mr Ponfield the Sentencing Judge said:
	


I have regard to the principles of totality and I am fully aware that I am sentencing him on top of an existing sentence. I am also mindful of achieving parity or proportionality with his co-offenders.


	
	In all of those circumstances this Court will be cautious in concluding that one co-offender has a justifiable sense of grievance simply because there are differing sentence outcomes: Loader v R; Dunn v R at [91]-[95]. Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; (2011) 214 A Crim R 191 at [77]-[83]. Nevertheless, there are two matters of particular concern which embrace both Mr Humphries’ and Mr Ponfield’s grounds of appeal as expanded upon by their submissions. The first is that there needs to be some explanation why, in the result and in the face of what the Sentencing Judge said he intended, Mr Wilson’s effective non-parole period is almost a year shorter than that imposed on Messrs Humphries and Ponfield. The second is the apparent discrepancy between the non-parole period for Mr Humphries (five years) on the one hand and the non-parole periods for Mr Ponfield (three years nine months) and Mr Wilson (three years six months) on the other. We will deal with each in turn. (Mr Ponfield’s complaint that his circumstances were relevantly different to those of his co-offenders is addressed at [61] to [62]].)
	
	
	When sentencing Mr Humphries the Sentencing Judge said:
	


Where an offender is serving an existing sentence the proper approach is to ask what would likely to have been the effective head sentence and non-parole period if the offender had been sentenced at the one time, Mill v R (1988) 1266 CLR 59 at 66 to 67. A Court must look at the totality of the criminality for all the offences. This principle needs to be applied here, and to achieve this I propose making the sentences partially concurrent with the existing sentence he is serving.


	
	His Honour then imposed a non-parole period of five years with an additional term of two years and six months. As noted, his Honour backdated the sentence so that the effective non-parole period for the armed robberies was three years and six months, seemingly the period his Honour was trying to achieve for all three offenders.
	
	
	In Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 66-67 the joint judgment said:
	


In our opinion, the proper approach which his Honour should have taken was to ask what would be likely to have been the effective head sentence imposed if the applicant had committed all three offences of armed robbery in one jurisdiction and had been sentenced at one time. It is most unlikely that the applicant would have been sentenced to eight years on the first count, eight years with six years of it concurrent on the second count, and eight years cumulative on the third count, making an aggregate head sentence of eighteen years. Yet that, it seems to us, is the practical effect of the sentence imposed by his Honour. On the other hand, the notional exercise which we have just described tends towards a conclusion that a sentencing court dealing with all three offences at the same time would have dealt with the third offence in a similar manner to that adopted when dealing with the second, namely, by imposing a sentence of eight years with five or six years of it concurrent with the earlier sentences. The aggregate head sentence in that event would have been either twelve or thirteen years. An appropriate non-parole period may well not have been much more than the eight years actually imposed by the Victorian court. But, of course, it is not possible for a second sentencing court to impose a concurrent sentence of the kind we have contemplated in the absence of statutory provisions enabling the backdating of the new sentence (cf. Reg. v. Gilbert (1975) 1 WLR 1012; (1975) 1 All ER 742 and Reg. v. Garrett (1978) 18 SASR 308). Section 20 of The Criminal Code (Q.) does not allow such a course to be taken. Without statutory authority, the only course open to the second sentencing court is to adopt a lower head sentence that reflects the long deferment that has taken place during which the offender has been in custody. It is true that the lower head sentence will fail to reflect adequately the seriousness of the crime in respect of which it is imposed. That is unfortunate. However, it is to be preferred to the injustice involved in the imposition of a longer head sentence because of the inadequacy of the law to cope satisfactorily with the intervention of State boundaries.


	
	In Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:
	


[45]   To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59


	
	This passage in Pearce describes the approach most commonly adopted when addressing questions of accumulation and totality namely, first identifying the appropriate sentence for the subject offence(s) and then considering questions of accumulation, concurrency as well as totality (the “Pearce approach”) often by reference to the commencement date of the sentence. The passage from Mill set out in [49] addressed the circumstance in which a sentencing Court is required to address questions of totality in the circumstance where another court has already imposed a sentence on the offender and the sentencing court is precluded from backdating the sentence. Hence the High Court referred to the sentencing court imposing a lower head sentence and aggregating it even though the sentence imposed may “fail to reflect adequately the seriousness of the crime” (the “Mill approach”).
	
	
	In Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [26] the High Court confirmed that, depending on the legislative context, both approaches were open to sentencing judges and, in particular, the adoption of the Mill approach is not confined to circumstances where the offender had already been sentenced by another court and the sentence to be imposed cannot be backdated:
	


“The first matter to be noticed in this regard is that the joint judgment in Pearce recognizes the currency of Mill by referring to the principle of totality which it reiterates …. The joint judgment in Mill expresses a preference for what should be regarded as the orthodox, but not necessarily immutable, practice of fixing a sentence for each offence and aggregating them before taking the next step of determining concurrency. Pearce does not decree that a sentencing judge may never lower each sentence and then aggregate them for determining the time to be served. To do that, is not to do what the joint judgment in Pearce holds to be undesirable, that is, to have regard only to the total effective sentence to be imposed on an offender. The preferable course will usually be the one which both cases commend but neither absolutely commands.”


	
	We have already addressed the aggravating factors and subjective features of Mr Humphries and Mr Wilson. We address Mr Ponfield’s circumstances below at [61]. Overall there was little to choose between the three offenders in terms of aggravating factors and subjective features, certainly nothing to the extent of an eighteen month difference in the non-parole period and, as a result, the overall sentence. Against that background the complaint of a lack of parity by reference to the effective sentence imposed on Mr Wilson can be addressed by considering Mr Wilson’s sentence and the the position of Mr Humphries.
	
	
	The difference in the effective non-parole period for the index offences between Mr Wilson on the one hand and the other offenders on the other cannot readily be explained by Mr Wilson serving a prior sentence because Mr Humphries was in the same position. Mr Humphries had been sentenced some two months earlier (4 July 2014) for the aggravated break, enter and steal. That sentence had itself been backdated to commence on 19 October 2011. The non-parole period for that offence extended to 17 April 2015 but Judge Arnott backdated Mr Humphries’ sentence for the armed robberies to 19 October 2013, apparently to bring about an effective non-parole period of three years and six months.
	
	
	When sentencing Mr Wilson Judge Arnott said in a passage following immediately what is set out above at [44]:
	


In Mill the High Court said the totality principle can be achieved by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent with an existing sentence. Or another, but the less preferred way, is to lower the individual’s sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate. Here, I am using the second way.


	
	Thus a reading of this passage and that set out at [44] and [55] suggests that, were it not for Mr Wilson’s other sentence, Judge Arnott would have sentenced him to a longer non-parole period, but to achieve parity with Mr Humphries the non-parole period was to be reduced to three years and six months. To this extent, as the sentencing judge stated, His Honour adopted the Mill approach whereas it seems that with Mr Humphries his Honour adopted the Pearce approach.
	
	
	However, his Honour made the sentence imposed on Mr Wilson concurrent with his existing sentence for a period of 11 months. This was inconsistent with His Honour’s stated intention to adopt the approach in Mill because that approach would entail aggregating the sentence for the offences the subject of this application upon Mr Wilson’s existing sentence. The effect of this was to negate the parity the Sentencing Judge said that he intended to achieve. Mr Wilson’s effective non-parole period for the armed robberies was two years and seven months. The end result was to produce a sense of grievance arising from the sentence imposed on Mr Humphries (and Mr Ponfield) on the one hand and the sentence imposed on Mr Wilson on the other. It is necessary, however, to consider whether that grievance is justifiable.
	
	
	In Saraya v Regina [2015] NSWCCA 63 the Court said:
	


[11]   Whilst disparity between sentences may be an indicator of appealable (sic) error, it is the presence of unjustifiable disparity that is the ground for intervention: Lowe at 610, 613, 617, 623; Postiglione at 322; Green at [32]. Consistently with that being the position and as was the case in Lowe, the disparity may arise in respect of, and the principle apply to, the sentence imposed on the first of a number of co-offenders to be sentenced, as is the case on this application: Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376; R v Bellorini and R v Ruiz [2000] NSWCCA 50.

[12]   In Green, the majority considered, in accordance with the view expressed by Mason J in Lowe at 613 - 614, that in the exercise of the appellate discretion enlivened by unjustifiable disparity, a “sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced … to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient”: [33]. At the same time it was recognised that the existence of a discretion to mitigate disparity by reducing a sentence to one which is otherwise inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so; and would not require the reduction of a sentence to a level which could be characterised as “an affront to the proper administration of justice”: [33].

[13]   These observations of the majority do not squarely address whether a sentence imposed on a co-offender that is manifestly inadequate can give rise to unjustifiable disparity.

[14]   As is noted by Bell J in Green at [106], there is authority in this Court that the inadequacy of the sentence imposed on a co-offender may be of such a degree that any sense of grievance engendered in the offender sentenced more severely cannot be regarded as legitimate. That was also the view of Brennan J in Lowe at 617 - 618. In R v Diamond (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1993, unrep) Hunt CJ at CL said at 5 (James J agreeing):

The sentence imposed … was, as I have said, appropriate and not excessive. That imposed by the Magistrate was, as I have also said, irresponsible. The disparity between them may give rise to a sense of grievance on the part of the applicant, but it was not a justifiable one.

See also per Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [69] and per Howie J (James and Davies JJ agreeing) in Josefski v R [2010] NSWCCA 41; 217 A Crim R 183 at [65].

[15]   The decision in Diamond is also cited in support of the proposition that the discretion to mitigate disparity should not be exercised to reduce an otherwise adequate sentence to a level which would be an affront to the proper administration of justice: see Green at [33] fn 96; R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317; 50 NSWLR 115 at [19]; R v Chen & Others [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [289]; R v Ismunandar and Siregar [2002] NSWCCA 477; 136 A Crim R 206 at [23] – [26].

[16]   The relevant principle is stated by R A Hulme J (Beazley JA and Hidden J agreeing) in Youkhana v R [2011] NSWCCA 37 at [49]:

… the Court has a discretion and is not bound to intervene if a sentence offends the parity principle. A reason for not intervening is if the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is manifestly inadequate and intervention would ""produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved"".

[17]   In such a case the necessity to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice continues to prevail for the reasons given by Gleeson CJ in R v Rexhaj (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 29 February 1996, unrep), in the following passage which is extracted in R v Ismunandar at [38]:

The principle which underlies … [intervention for disparity] … is that inconsistency in punishment may lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice… . There are, however, other things which may also lead to an erosion of public confidence in the administration of justice, and they include the multiplication of manifest errors. That is why numerous judges have stressed the unattractiveness of responding to one wrong decision by making another wrong decision.


	
	The principle is apposite in the present case particularly because the Sentencing Judge said that he was reducing Mr Wilson’s sentence below what would otherwise be appropriate.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offences was 25 years imprisonment. As noted, the Sentencing Judge found that the robbery was planned, a real pistol was used, it was pointed separately at the two persons robbed, one of the offenders (Mr Ponfield) carried a knife, all of the offenders were on conditional liberty at the time of the offending and being in company was an aggravating factor. Although his Honour made no specific finding of the objective seriousness of the offences, his comparisons with the guideline judgment in Henry make clear that he regarded the offences as serious. Furthermore, the offenders were sentenced after being found guilty at trial with no discounts being accorded.
	
	
	As to the separate position of Mr Ponfield and contrary to his submission, we do not consider that there is any material difference in Mr Ponfield’s position relative to that of his co-offenders. Whilst he was younger (24 at the time of the offending with Mr Humphries being 34 and Mr Wilson 31) the age difference is immaterial particularly having regard to Mr Ponfield’s criminal record. The Sentencing Judge summarised it as follows:
	


He has a criminal history dating back over 11 years to the Children's Court. He was dealt with in the Children's Court mainly for offences of take and drive conveyance, carried in conveyance taken without consent of owner, goods in custody, larceny, possess prohibited drug and driving offences. In 2004 he was dealt with for stalk, intimate with intent to cause fear or harm, in 2005 for a number of assaults and an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and in 2006 for malicious wounding.

As an adult, apart from driving convictions, he has convictions in 2007 for assault, in 2007 possess unauthorised firearm and ammunition, and fire firearm into building or onto enclosed lands, in 2008 carry cutting weapon upon apprehension, in 2008 aggravated (in company) break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, in 2009 affray, in 2011 possess housebreaking implements and means of disguising of face and goods in custody, in 2012 possess shorten firearm without authority, in 2012 being carried in conveyance taken without consent of owner.


	
	Whilst that record does not include prior offences of armed robbery it includes serious property offences, offences of violence and firearm offences. The Sentencing Judge detailed Mr Ponfield’s background and his subjective matters. We have already noted that there was little difference in the deprived backgrounds of each of the offenders. As with the co-offenders the Sentencing Judge found that Mr Ponfield was not contrite and his prospects of rehabilitation guarded. There is nothing pertaining to Mr Ponfield that gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on Mr Wilson and Mr Humphries.
	
	
	In all those circumstances, we consider that any reduction of the sentences of Mr Humphries and Mr Ponfield to achieve parity with the effective sentence that Mr Wilson received would mean their sentences would be erroneously lenient. For that reason, their sense of grievance cannot be said to be justifiable.
	
	
	There remains to be considered the alleged discrepancy between the sentences imposed on Mr Humphries on the one hand and Mr Ponfield (and Mr Wilson) on the other in terms of the length of the non parole period. As stated in respect of the offences the subject of this appeal, Mr Humphries received a total sentence of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of five years whereas Mr Ponfield received a sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years and nine months. However, the sentence imposed on Mr Humphries was expressed to run concurrently with his existing sentence for eighteen months such that, if not interfered with, he will only serve three years six months in custody solely referable to the offences the subject of this appeal. The sentence imposed on Mr Ponfield was backdated to the date of his arrest, 19 June 2013, which was only two months prior to the expiry of his sentence for other offences such that he will serve three years and seven months in custody solely referable to the offences the subject of this appeal.
	
	
	Clearly the sentences were imposed with an intention to achieve roughly equal treatment between Mr Humphries and Mr Ponfield in terms of the period to be served in custody solely referable to the offences the subject of this appeal. In circumstances where there was no relevant difference in their respective criminality and subjective circumstances such an approach was not erroneous per se.
	
	
	However, his Honour did not explain the rationale for the differences in the structure of the two sentences. We have described the Pearce approach and the Mill approach above. As noted and although it was not expressly stated it seems that, given the length of the sentence and the substantial backdating that occurred, his Honour adopted the Pearce approach when sentencing Mr Humphries. Also as noted in the case of Mr Wilson his Honour expressly stated that he was adopting the approach in Mill although, as noted at [57], that approach was negated by making the sentence concurrent with the existing sentence. However, his Honour did not state which approach was being adopted in relation to Mr Ponfield. The length of the sentence suggests that it was the approach in Mill. An attempt to adopt the approach in Pearce in the case of Mr Ponfield while imposing a sentence of similar length to that imposed on Mr Humphries but preserving the intention of having them both serve the same period in custody solely referable to these offences could only have been achieved by backdating the sentence to a time prior to Mr Ponfield's arrest which, although permitted by s 47(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), would have been unusual.
	
	
	Nevertheless it was always open to His Honour to adopt the approach in Mill in respect of Mr Humphries or the approach in Pearce for Mr Ponfield (and Mr Wilson). If His Honour had done so then the objective of having both Mr Humphries and Mr Ponfield serve the same period in custody solely referable to the subject offences could still have been achieved and a correspondence in the actual sentences imposed would have been apparent. The present structure of the sentences gives the appearance that Mr Humphries was dealt with more severely and that appearance could become reality if for some reason his or Mr Ponfield's other sentences were set aside or interfered with for reasons unrelated to this appeal.
	
	
	It was not contended on this appeal that, where the criminality and subjective circumstances of co-offenders is roughly equal, it is per se erroneous for a sentencing judge to adopt the Pearce approach for one co-offender and the approach in Mill for another. Given the multitudinous circumstances that can face sentencing judges such a contention seems unlikely to be correct. However, at the very least in a case such as this, sentencing judges should explain the basis for adopting different sentence structures imposed on co-offenders with equal culpability and similar subjective circumstances and, where the approach in Mill is adopted, the extent of the reduction that is applied. This will allow for transparency in sentencing, assist this Court in performing its appellate function and minimise ""artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences"" (Pearce at [48]). In this case as between Mr Humphries and Mr Ponfield no such explanation was proffered by the sentencing judge with the result that, on its face, there is an unexplained disparity between the sentence imposed on Mr Humphries compared with that imposed on Mr Ponfield. As a result Mr Humphries has established error.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Error having been established, it is necessary for this Court to exercise afresh the discretion to re-sentence Mr Humphries: Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42].
	
	
	For the purpose of re-sentencing the findings made by the Sentencing Judge in relation to Mr Humphries are accepted. They are amply supported by the material available. There is, in addition, an affidavit of Mr Humphries filed in the appeal and read in case of re-sentence. In that affidavit Mr Humphries says that he has commenced an intensive learning course to bring him up to the standard of Year 10 at high school. He has completed level 1 and hopes to complete level 2 this year. Thereafter he wishes to undertake some other programs in relation to drug addiction and anger management. Nothing in that affidavit would cause us to differ from the Sentencing Judge’s conclusion that his prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded.
	
	
	Consistent with our observations in [65] and to achieve consistency with the sentence imposed on his co-offenders the structure of the sentence imposed on Mr Humphries should reflect the approach in Mill even though the Pearce approach is the preferred one. Further parity warrants a sentence of approximately equal length to that imposed on Mr Ponfield. Had we not adopted that approach then we would have concluded that a sentence no shorter in length and no earlier in commencement date than that imposed by the sentencing judge was appropriate for Mr Humphries.
	
	
	Having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, Mr Humphries’ subjective matters and the sentences imposed on Mr Ponfield and Mr Wilson, we consider that the appropriate sentence for Mr Humphries for each of the offences is a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and three months expiring 18 January 2021. The sentence on each of the counts should be served concurrently with the other. The effect of these sentences does not alter any of the minimum period that it is expected that Mr Humphries will serve solely referable to these offences, his expected release date or the date his sentence expires.
	


Conclusion


	
	We propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to Mark Humphries to appeal.
	
	
	In the appeal by Mark Humphries allow the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court.
	
	
	In lieu, sentence the Appellant Mark Humphries to a sentence for each count comprising a non-parole period of three years nine months commencing 19 January 2015 and expiring 18 October 2018 with an additional term of two years and three months expiring 18 January 2021. The sentences are to be served concurrently.
	
	
	Otherwise dismiss the appeal by Mark Humphries.
	
	
	Leave to Wade Ponfield to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

2701642,Park v Lee [2016] NSWDC 75,"Judgment

The application before the court


	
	The defendants apply for an order pursuant to rr 12.7, 13.4(1)(b) and 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (“UCPR”) and s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for these proceedings to be dismissed as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.
	


Background


	
	The plaintiff, by statement of claim filed on 12 November 2015, brings proceedings for defamation against two defendants who provided witness statements for use in the proceedings between the plaintiff and her former husband in the Family Law division, Uijeongbu District Court, Goyang Branch, South Korea. The first defendant, an accountant who prepared tax returns for the plaintiff and her former husband, provided a witness statement, dated 8 September 2015 containing accounting and other information about their assets, as well as making statements critical of the conduct of the plaintiff in regard to those assets. The second defendant, a friend of the plaintiff’s former husband, refers to Family Court proceedings in Australia as well as in Korea.
	
	
	The particulars of publication have never been articulated with precision. The statement of claim refers to the statement as having been “distributed to various third parties” whose identity “will be provided in due course” (paragraphs 5 and 10 of the statement of claim), although acknowledging that the matters complained of were published “in connection with a legal dispute in Korea between the plaintiff and her former husband” (paragraph 9). No hint was given that the matters complained of were published in a foreign language or in a jurisdiction other than Australia, the matters complained of were not attached, and the matter was listed before the Registrar of this court on 18 January 2016 rather than in the Defamation List.
	
	
	The Registrar made orders for the filing of an amended pleading and referred the proceedings to the Defamation List for case management. The amended statement of claim filed on 2 February 2016 attached the matters complained of with an attachment but no attempt was made to provide proper (or indeed any) particulars of publication, which were simply noted as “currently being ascertained” (paragraph 10).
	
	
	A consent timetable was entered into on 10 March 2016. The further amended statement of claim amended the particulars of publication to provide:
	


“The statement was published in [sic] Family law Division, Uijeongbu District Court Branch in South Korea. Further particulars of to whom the statement was distributed are currently being ascertained [sic] will be provided in due course.”


	
	This is still very limited information. I note that in their letter of 9 March 2016 the solicitors for the defendants add, in terms of recipients of the publication, that publication “was made to the court in Korea, and the legal advisors [sic] of both parties as well as persons who were privy to any judgment in Korea”.
	
	
	It is conceded, by the legal representatives of the plaintiff, that the only publication of the matters complained of occurred in South Korea, and that any such publication solely related to the provision of the statements to the court. I was not told whether the reference to “any judgment” means that a judgment has actually been handed down, or that one is likely to be handed down in the future. I have addressed this issue on both scenarios in this judgment.
	
	
	If the relevant law to apply to these publications were the uniform legislation and Australian common law, these proceedings could never survive summary dismissal. Not only are these witness statements, but the extent of publication is only to the court and the legal advisers and to those reading the judgment of the judge who heard the action. There could be no clearer case of the publications being made on occasions protected by absolute privilege: see the authorities collected in Cumberland v Clark (1996) 39 NSWLR 514.
	
	
	The defendants’ application is, however, that this court lacks jurisdiction or alternatively is not the proper forum.
	


The District Court’s jurisdiction


	
	The defendants’ primary submission is that this court has no jurisdiction to hear any claim for a tortious cause of action which occurred outside Australia.
	
	
	Section 9(1) District Court Act 1973 (NSW) provides that the Court shall have civil jurisdiction consisting of its jurisdiction as follows:
	


“9 Jurisdiction of the Court generally

(1) The Court shall have a civil jurisdiction, consisting of:

(a) its jurisdiction conferred by Part 3, and

(b) the jurisdiction conferred by or under any other Act or law on the Court, not being its jurisdiction referred to in subsection (2).”


	
	Section 23 Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) provides that the Supreme Court has such jurisdiction as may be necessary for the administration of justice in New South Wales and clearly this includes actions for defamation. As to the Supreme Court’s power to hear claims which have their basis in a cause of action overseas, the Supreme Court has long had such jurisdiction, for the reasons explained by Basten JA in Nicholls v Michael Wilson and Partners Limited [2010] NSWCA 222 and by Hunt J in Ainsworth v Hanrahan [1982] 2 NSWLR 823 at 825. Rule 6.43 UCPR also provide for the filing of foreign law notices and/or for orders for the commencement of proceedings in a foreign court (UCPR r 6.44).
	
	
	A good example of proceedings being commenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales for a publication wholly outside the jurisdiction of Australia is Ainsworth v Hanrahan, where the matter complained of was a statement made by the defendant on the telephone to the District Attorney of New Jersey. The publication could be defended under the law of the forum or alternatively under the lex loci delicti, namely the State of Jersey in the United States of America. Hunt J explained the basis for the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction as follows:
	


“The defendant's first argument is that, as the publication is alleged to havetaken place in New Jersey in the United States, this Court has no jurisdictionto entertain the proceedings notwithstanding the defendant's ordinaryresidence within this State. No authority was cited for this somewhatsurprising submission. Nor could there be. Quite apart from the uncondition­al appearance filed on behalf of the defendant (who is described therein as a“Police Officer of Penrith Police Station”), it has been settled law for overtwo hundred years that the English courts have jurisdiction to entertainactions based on torts committed abroad if the wrongdoer can be foundwithin the jurisdiction: Mostyn v Fabrigas (1774) 1 Cowp 161, at p 181; 98ER 1021, at p 1032; The “Halley”; Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate SteamNavigation Co Ltd v Benham (1868) LR 2 PC 193, at pp 202, 203; Phillips vEyre (1869) LR 4 QB 225, at p 238; on error: (1870) LR 6 QB 1, at pp 28, 29;Walker v W A Pickles Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 281, at p 284, although thequestion of what law is to be applied in such actions could hardly be said tohave been settled even now: Cawley v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd[1981] 1 NSWLR 225, at pp 228, 229; Carleton v Freedom Publishing Co(Kelly J, Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, 29th October, 1982,unreported). The defendant's submission disputing this Court's jurisdiction isrejected.”


	
	However, the District Court is a court of inferior jurisdiction, and only possesses such express powers in relation to claims arising in foreign jurisdictions as are statutorily conferred and any incidental powers that can be implied. Section 44(1)(a) District Court Act 1973 (NSW) provides that the court has jurisdiction to hear and dispose of actions which would have been assigned to the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court (subject to jurisdictional limits which are irrelevant here), namely defamation claims, including claims arising outside New South Wales where service has been regularly effected in accordance with s 47 District Court Act 1973 (NSW).
	
	
	What jurisdiction, if any, does the District Court have to hear a defamation action where a defence under foreign law must be pleaded and proved? This is determined by an examination of not only this Court’s derived power to hear actions in the Supreme Court Common Law Division, but also the relevant provisions for the pleading and the proving of foreign law.
	


How foreign law is proved


	
	There can be no doubt that the place of publication is South Korea (Dow Jones & Co v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575) and the plaintiff does not suggest otherwise. As no actionable publication can arise in Australia, questions of defences fall to be considered under the lex loci delicti, depending upon whether one, the other or both of the parties chooses to raise this issue.
	
	
	These issues were of concern in Regie National des Usines Renault SA v Zhang (2002) 187 ALR 1; [2002] HCA 10, where the majority applied John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503 (inter alia, that all questions about the kinds of damage or amount of damages that may be recovered would be treated as substantive issues governed by the lex loci delicti) to a situation where some part of the claim arose in Australia. Their Honours reserved for further consideration, as the occasion arises, whether that proposition should be applied in cases of foreign tort (at [76]). Similarly, in Mills v Commonwealth of Australia (2003) Aust Torts Reports 81-714, Malpass AsJ reserved this question for further consideration, noting that there was “little guidance in the material as to the nature and extent of damages that may be awarded by a Cambodian Court” (at [33]).
	
	
	Some of these issues were resolved by the provision of r 6.43 UCPR, which provides a mechanism for the determining of foreign law, expressly reserved to the Supreme Court, and not referred to as being available in the District Court. Contrary to the submissions of Mr Cohen, the fact that a cause of action arises in a jurisdiction other than Australia does not mean that the court automatically assumes that the relevant foreign law applies; not only must notices be served under r 6.43 UCPR (which may only occur in the Supreme Court), but that foreign law must be established by expert evidence.
	
	
	In Nicholls v Michael Wilson and Partners Limited, Basten JA sets out the correct approach to the pleading and proving of foreign law, and the inferences which are drawn where no such evidence is available:
	


“[321] In Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54 ; 223 CLR 331 (Neilson), Gummow and Hayne JJ observed (at [115]):

The courts of Australia are not presumed to have any knowledge of foreign law. Decisions about the content of foreign law create no precedent. That is why foreign law is a question of fact to be proved by expert evidence.

[322] Their Honours referred to “the well-known rule that, absent proof of, or agreement about, foreign law, the law of the forum is to be applied” (at [116]). This is commonly referred to as a “presumption” that where foreign law on a question is to be applied under the choice of law rules of the forum, the foreign law to be applied is the same as the law of the forum. The primary Judge cited numerous authorities for this familiar principle (at [313]). (The learned authors of the eighth edition of Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia propose the description “default rule” as preferable to that of “presumption” (at [17.37]).)

[323] It follows that the onus is on a party asserting that foreign law is applicable and is different from the law of the forum to plead and prove those matters, including what that foreign law is, and that MWP was entitled to rely on the presumption that the law of the forum would be applied unless the appellants pleaded and proved both the applicability and the content of the relevant part of foreign law: see Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang [2002] HCA 10 ; 210 CLR 491 (Zhang) at [70]–[71] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Dyno Wesfarmers Ltd v Knuckey [2003] NSWCA 375 per Young CJ in Eq at [49]–[56]; and see Neilson at [125] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.”


	
	The language of r 6.43 UCPR is clear: such procedures are available in the Supreme Court, and not in this court.
	
	
	Ms Barnett is correct in her submission that any such application would have to be heard in the Supreme Court, and the proceedings transferred to that jurisdiction for that purpose.
	
	
	This argument, of course, depends upon one or the other of the parties seeking to rely upon foreign law. If the law of the forum were applied, these proceedings would be disposed of very speedily, in that the publications were made on admitted occasions of absolute privilege.
	


Conclusions concerning jurisdiction


	
	The statements of the High Court in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick at [44] do not derogate from the longstanding principles set out by Hunt J in Ainsworth v Hanrahan as to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear defamation proceedings where the matter complained of was published in a foreign jurisdiction. The question in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick was whether to set aside service outside the jurisdiction on a foreign defendant, or to stay the proceedings on forum conveniens principles; the defendants in these proceedings reside in New South Wales and have been served in accordance with the relevant UCPR provisions (s 47 District Court Act 1973 (NSW)).
	
	
	This means that the absence of jurisdiction of the District Court by reason of the language of UCPR r 6.43 is not strictly speaking a strike-out point, in that an application could be brought by the plaintiff for the proceedings to be transferred to the Supreme Court for determination of the foreign law expert evidence issue (where, as I read UCPR r 6.43, it would probably have to remain). No such application is before the court, and Mr Cohen has not indicated any such instructions to bring one. It would therefore be open to me to strike out these proceedings on that basis alone.
	
	
	Having regard to the pleading and procedural history of these proceedings, as well as the nature of the publications, I consider that any reluctance the court may feel in striking out a defect curable by amendment (see Ritchie’s Uniform Law and Procedure NSW at [14.28.25]) should be put to one side and the proceedings struck out.
	
	
	I have, however, determined the issues of forum conveniens and proportionality as well and, as I have arrived at the same conclusion in relation to all three arguments, propose to dismiss these proceedings on all three bases.
	


Forum conveniens


	
	Although there are court proceedings in Korea, of which the matters complained of form part, this is not a case of lis alibi pendens, as the similarity between the parties and issues is insufficient: Evers v Firth (1986) 10 NSWLR 22. Nevertheless, the fact that there are current (or concluded) court proceedings in Korea reliant upon the testimony which is set out in the matters complained of is of very high significance in relation to the issue of forum conveniens.
	
	
	As noted in Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick at [49] – [54], defamation proceedings have long presented forum conveniens problems by their very nature as multiple torts, independent of additional issues raised by the advent of the Internet. The first of these is that it is an abuse of process for a plaintiff to start defamation proceedings over the same matter in more than one jurisdiction, certainly within Australia, according to Maple v David Syme & Co [1975] 1 NSWLR 97, although the situation may not be so easy to determine where the publications complained of are made in different countries: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 6 September 1996), and this raises issues as to the convenient forum.
	
	
	Where the parties live in one jurisdiction and the matter complained of is published in another, what is a plaintiff to do? If the defamation occurs in a foreign country, the action may be brought in the courts of the jurisdiction where the plaintiff resides; in addition to the principles set out by Hunt J in Ainsworth v Hanrahan, see the more recent authorities set out in Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States at [17.3(1.1)(a)], starting with Hart v Gumpach (1872) 9 Moo 241, 17 ER 505. Less charitably, in Eyre v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1967) NZLR 851 at 854, MacGregor J considered that “loss of reputation (which a plaintiff) has suffered abroad from publication in another country is a matter for the courts exercising jurisdiction in the country of publication”. There are helpful checklists for forum conveniens factors in defamation actions set out in a number of cases, notably Muscutt v Courcelles (2002) 13 CCLT (3d)161, 26 CPC (5th) 206, 60 OR (3d) 20 at 45 – 51, but the cases tend to turn on their facts.
	
	
	The difficulties for the interpretation of the defences for the lex fori are also an issue. In Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick at [51] Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ noted that these problems included:
	


“[51] Secondly, a case in which it is alleged that the publisher's conduct has all occurred outside the jurisdiction of the forum may invite attention to whether the reasonableness of the publisher's conduct should be given any significance in deciding whether it has a defence to the claim made. In particular, it may invite attention to whether the reasonableness of the publisher's conduct should be judged according to all the circumstances relevant to its conduct, including where that conduct took place, and what rules about defamation applied in that place or those places. Consideration of those issues may suggest that some development of the common law defences in defamation is necessary or appropriate to recognise that the publisher may have acted reasonably before publishing the material of which complaint is made.” [Citations omitted]


	
	The development of the Jameel principle (Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc [2005] QB 946) owes much to the perceived difficulties of “libel tourism” (i.e. shopping around for a more plaintiff-friendly forum), which is why the issue of proportionality is of relevance to forum conveniens where there are publications in more than one country, as is discussed further below.
	
	
	The plaintiff can point to the presence not only of the defendants but of their assets in this jurisdiction, as well as her own presence. The courts in New South Wales can provide speedy justice, especially since it would appear that, if the uniform law were applied (as opposed to the lex loci delicti), these proceedings would be likely to be protected by the defence of absolute privilege, since they appear not merely to have been provided to the court for the proceedings but could already be the subject of a judgment. Furthermore, in Australia the content of the matters complained of could not be published outside those parameters because of anti-publication provisions for Family Court proceedings (e.g. s 120 Family Law Act 1975 (Cth)). These are powerful factors to take into consideration.
	
	
	However, there are countervailing arguments. The plaintiff’s reputation was damaged in Korea, and it is important for the person defamed to have the proceedings tried in the jurisdiction where his or her reputation was damaged. The defendants would be entitled to rely not only upon the defences of the forum in relation to the circumstances in which they gave their evidence but upon the circumstances in which those publications were made.
	
	
	One factor, in my view, puts all other forum conveniens factors to one side. These are witness statements provided to a court which either have or will result in a judgment of the Korean court. This was considered an important factor in Tyne & Anor v USB AG (No 3) [2016] FCA 5, where a party continued litigation in Australia despite an anti-suit injunction being granted in Singapore. I am satisfied that this fact, and the need for comity between courts determining issues between the parties, trump all other factors.
	
	
	Where the defamation action has been commenced in a jurisdiction which is clearly inappropriate, the moving party may, under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, apply not merely to stay the proceedings but for an anti-suit injunction: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick at [50] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Amchem Products Inc v British Columbia (Workers Compensation Board) [1993] No 34, 1993 Carswell BC 47, 77 BCLR (2d) 62, 102 CLR (4th) 96. Such an application would be entertained only where “a serious injustice will be occasioned as a result of the failure of a foreign court to decline jurisdiction” (CSR Ltd v New Zealand Insurance Co Ltd (1994) 36 NSWLR 138 at 161).
	
	
	While there is no anti-suit injunction in Korea of the kind identified in Tyne & Anor v USB AG (No 3), the same principles of comity between courts still apply. I specifically note the observations in Tyne & Anor v USB AG (No 3) at [231] that it is not necessary for the proceedings in this jurisdiction to be shown to be vexatious or oppressive (citing Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538) for a stay to be granted.
	
	
	I am satisfied that New South Wales is not the appropriate forum and the extraordinary circumstances in which defamation proceedings have been brought in this country for a witness statement which forms part of proceedings and apparently also the judgment in Family Court proceedings in Korea, that this would be sufficient for an anti-suit injunction staying these proceedings.
	
	
	Accordingly I am satisfied that New South Wales is not the appropriate forum for these proceedings.
	


Proportionality


	
	The principles enunciated in Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones & Co Inc are set out in Bleyer v Google Inc (2014) 88 NSWLR 670; [2014] NSWCA 897, and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them, or to set out the relevant portions of s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) or UCPR r 12.7.
	
	
	The applicability of proportionality principles to a publication which is made in an overseas jurisdiction is not free from controversy. In Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 431 the defamation claim against one defendant related to three publications he made in the United States, and he brought an application to dismiss the claim on proportionality principles. The issues relied upon were similar to those applicable here: the limited nature of the publications, the strength of the defences, and the financial burdens involved. I note, however, that the strength of the lex loci delicti defences, rather than the lex fori defences, were asserted to be the key issue.
	
	
	Garling J, at [116]-[147], dismissed the relevance of Jameel principles entirely, although noting at [147] that no Reply had been filed, holding that it was inappropriate to deal with the argument at an early stage of the defamation claim. Although not stated expressly, his Honour was clearly considering the disputed issues of fact likely to arise in relation to the defences in the foreign jurisdiction (about which Garling J had very limited evidence). While Mr Cohen says I have no evidence of Korean law’s recognition of absolute privilege, that is his client’s problem, not the defendants’, and I consider I may have regard to the likelihood of dismissal of these proceedings in New South Wales if the law of the forum were exercised, in the absence of any evidence (expert or otherwise) as to the law of South Korea.
	
	
	In Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd [2015] NSWCA 25 Macfarlan JA stressed that the circumstances where proceedings would be struck out on principles of proportionality would have to be exceptional. I consider that, where a publication is made for the purposes of court proceedings and published only to those concerned, exceptional circumstances are made out (see the judgments to this effect set out in Calabro v Zappia [2010] NSWDC 127). Accordingly these proceedings are also struck out pursuant to s 61 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and r 12.7 UCPR as well as pursuant to rr 13.4(1)(b) and 14.28 UCPR.
	


Costs


	
	Mrs Barnett submits that indemnity costs should be awarded for the following reasons:
	



	
	The plaintiff’s inability to frame her claim on fundamental issues such as the provision of the matters complained of and proper particulars of identification;
	
	
	The dilatory conduct of these proceedings by the plaintiff thereafter, including failure to answer correspondence or to deal with the issues raised in correspondence expeditiously;
	
	
	The persistence of the plaintiff with the claim despite clear warning of this application.
	



	
	I agree that there has been an unacceptable level of delay and inadequate pleading, and would add that the opacity of the plaintiff’s submissions has also created difficulty.
	
	
	Indemnity costs should not be awarded other than in circumstances where the conduct in question is egregious and the defaults of a significant nature.
	
	
	The delays and inadequacies of pleadings, the nature of the cause of action and the manner of presentation of the plaintiff’s arguments on this application in my view warrant an order for indemnity costs.
	


Orders


	
	Proceedings dismissed.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendants’ costs on an indemnity basis.

2701653,Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I agree, for the reasons given by Adams J, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld on the basis that the sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify the discount allowed for Mr Panetta’s assistance to the authorities.
	
	
	As to the re-sentencing exercise that this Court is therefore now required to undertake in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601; 238 A Crim R 134, I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of each of Adams and Bellew JJ. Where their Honours depart, in essence, is as to the appropriate starting point before application of the respective discounts that must be applied in the present case and as to the appropriate discounts themselves. Each of their Honours considers that the cumulative operation of the respective discounts he would allow for Mr Panetta’s plea of guilty and his considerable assistance to the authorities would produce an overall sentence that was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence; and hence would apply a reduced combined discount.
	
	
	The nature and circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances to be taken into account are set out in Adams J’s judgment and do not need here to be repeated.
	
	
	For the reasons expressed by Bellew J, I am of the opinion that the appropriate sentence before the application of any discount is 24 years. Though the murder was not premeditated, this was a brutal attack visited upon the deceased and the seriousness of the offence was aggravated by the steps that Mr Panetta then took to conceal his crime, including burying the body.
	
	
	I also agree with the conclusions Bellew J has reached as to the appropriate discounts to reflect the guilty plea (10%) and the high level of assistance to authorities (50%). As to the former, the guilty plea was entered only shortly before the commencement of the trial. Some of the delay in the entry of that plea was attributable to issues in relation to Mr Panetta’s legal representation and the need to obtain a psychiatric assessment of Mr Panetta. No criticism is made of the course taken by the defence in that regard. Nevertheless, when considering the utilitarian value of a plea the primary consideration is the timing of the plea (R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104).
	
	
	As to the latter, I note the rationale for reducing a sentence by reason of assistance to the authorities as summarised in Isaac v R [2012] NSWCCA 195 and I agree that considerable leniency must be extended to Mr Panetta, who voluntarily disclosed the offence in circumstances where it was not known that a crime had been committed, let alone that he had or might have had any involvement in that crime, and whose assistance led to the discovery of the deceased’s remains. I further accept that, as is implicit in Adams J’s observations (at [49]), this is an unusual case. Nevertheless I agree with Bellew J that a 50% discount is appropriate for the assistance rendered by Mr Panetta to the authorities.
	
	
	As Bellew J has adverted to at [76], the view has been expressed that the constraint imposed by s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) will not generally be met by allowing a combined discount of more than 50% (Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323 at [33] per McCallum J). However, that does not mean that in an appropriate case the combined discount could not be more than 50%. In the present case a combined discount of 60% in my view appropriately reflects both the utilitarian value of the guilty plea and the high level of assistance provided by Mr Panetta in the very unusual circumstances of this case.
	
	
	However, I also consider that the operation of a 60% combined discount would result in a sentence unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence and that a reduction in the combined discount is required. I accept that views may reasonably differ as to the appropriate reduction for this purpose. Having considered the matters raised by Adams J, I nevertheless consider that the combined discount should be reduced to 50%, with the result that the total term of imprisonment should be 12 years, comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years. I therefore agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J.
	
	
	ADAMS J:
	


Introduction


	
	On 14 November 2013 the appellant (since the appeal is allowed, it is convenient to so term him) was convicted on his plea of murdering Muhammed Shafique on 18 September 2008. He was sentenced on 7 March 2014 to a term of 17 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years and 9 months commencing on 12 November 2010. He seeks leave to appeal to this Court against his sentence. The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 20 years applies. These penalties are guideposts for the purposes of sentence, although it is, in substance, agreed that the objective seriousness of the offence is somewhat less than in the middle of the range.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal are as follows –
	


“Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in the exercise of his discretion with respect to the assessment of the discount to be allowed in relation to the appellant's plea of guilty.

Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to quantify the discount allowed on the basis of the appellant's assistance to the authorities.

Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred in the failing to adequately discount the sentence on the basis of the appellant's voluntary disclosure of guilt and his plea of guilty.

Ground 4: The learned trial judge erred in failing to properly apply the principles concerning the appellant's intellectual functioning.

Ground 5: The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.”

Factual background


	
	An agreed statement of facts was tendered without objection, from which the narrative in the reasons of the learned primary judge was largely drawn. Given that his Honour’s judgment has been published, I do not propose to set out the facts in the same detail and have confined myself to what I regard to be the most salient features. (I have mostly not indicated quotations, for ease of reading.)
	
	
	In 1987 the victim married Sharon Shafique but, in 2004 they separated, Sharon remaining at the family residence, with the children at first but they later went to live with the deceased. In 2007 the couple were divorced and, late that year, Ms Shafique commenced an intimate relationship with the appellant (whose intellectual functioning was between low average to average range – this matter is further discussed when dealing with subjective features), who believed Ms Shafique was 19 years old although she was in fact 39 or 40 years of age. She had introduced her two children to him as her younger brother and sister, telling them not to say that she was their mother and that they should refer to her by the name “Nadia” when they were in his presence.
	
	
	The victim was killed by the appellant on 18 September 2008 but both his death and the appellant’s involvement only came to light when he attended Dee Why police station on 12 November 2010 and confessed. His admissions to the police about the circumstances were not the subject of any dispute and may be accepted, although some details, for example concerning movements of the victim’s car on 18 September 2008, are not completely reliable (accepted by his Honour as possibly resulting from the lapse of time and the appellant’s distressed state when being interviewed). The appellant told police about commencing his relationship with “Nadia” who told him that the deceased was a bad person associated with the Taliban and was involved in fraud and criminal activity. He said she told him that the police had not been able to find any evidence against him and that he decided he would attempt to gather evidence against him to give to the police and started to follow him. For this purpose he purchased an electronic tracking device in early June 2008, which he attached to the deceased’s vehicle and he was able to use his computer to track its movements. On 18 September 2008 the appellant drove his van to the underground car park of the residential unit block where the victim had a “business office” and waited for him to arrive. Sometime after 2pm the victim drove his vehicle into the car park and parked alongside the appellant’s vehicle. When he alighted, the appellant grabbed him and attempted to put him in the rear of his van, intending to abduct and rob him, using cable ties that he had brought with him. The primary judge set out the following extracts from the transcript of the appellant’s interview –
	


“Q32 I don't know if I was tricked or I'm not sure. Um, I got told this person who was dealing with illegal, bringing people into the country and was a bad person and all this and I sort of took advantage of the situation and I, I, my anger got the better of me and um, I took care of this person...'

Q33 ....the police wanted evidence to arrest this man.

Q34 ....so I was trying to get evidence but I took it too far and didn't go the way of the plan and I killed him.

Q113 She said there's this bad person bringing illegal people from overseas and myself being a gambler I thought he had money so I went to follow him for the reason that she wanted to get him into trouble with the police but the police didn't have enough evidence on him because he was too tricky, too many different identities so I tried to get evidence, it didn't quite work out that way and got myself in a big problem now.

Q 35 '... Well I was trying to tie him up in my van but he reached and got my hammer out of my van, struck me in the head once so I took the hammer off him and repeatedly hit him in the head...'

Q 161 (I followed him that day) (t)o try and catch him getting fraudulent mail from the post office which he had multiple keys to post office boxes.

Q249 '... I tried to tie him up. There was a hammer there which I use for work, he grabbed it, struck me in the head with it.

Q252 '...As a soon as that happened I grabbed the hammer off him and I repeatedly hit him in the head...'

Q 253 '...Probably about fifteen times...'

Q 256 'I just went into a rage.

Q 585 Well it was drummed into my head that this guy's got to go down, he's in they've got to get him in trouble with the cops because of what he's doing so I thought it would be a good idea.

Q 601 I was meant to do one thing but it led to another.”


	
	The appellant placed the victim’s body in the back of his van, found a hose and washed down the blood on the ground where the attack occurred. He panicked and, taking a briefcase from the victim’s vehicle, drove his van to a location near Campbelltown where, after dark, he buried the body in bushland. He disposed of the briefcase and contents and stole $1,400 from the victim’s wallet before discarding it. He burnt the documents that were in the briefcase. He had previously smashed the victim’s mobile phone and put it in a rubbish bin because he was worried about the phone being traced.
	
	
	The appellant told police that, at the time of the offence, he had alcohol in his system, having drunk two cans of Johnny Walker and coke.
	
	
	The appellant told police that he had broken up with “Nadia” in the months following the incident but frequently contacted her. He said he had come forward due to the overwhelming stress and anxiety that the matter had caused him, saying, “I couldn’t live with this anymore”. When speaking with police and being interviewed he appeared to be highly distressed.
	
	
	The area identified by the appellant as the place of burial was excavated and skeletal remains were located. The hands were cable tied to the rear. Dental records identified the body as being that of Muhammed Shafique. Information from the autopsy was limited due to the decomposition of the body. Two large fractures were located on the right side of the head consistent with the appellant’s admissions but the number of blows could not be accurately determined.
	
	
	Police confirmed that Ms Shafique had previously claimed the victim was involved in criminal activities, on 24 January 2007 having provided information to the Australian Federal Police alleging his involvement in fraud and possible terrorist activities. After his murder, on 24 October 2008, the New South Wales Police Fraud Control and Investigations “dob in line” was called by a female describing herself as “Claudia” (believed by police to be Ms Shafique) suggesting that he was a member of the Taliban involved in people smuggling. Investigations have not found support for her claims. This information provides independent support for the appellant’s account of his motive.
	
	
	Prior to the appellant handing himself in, there was no suspicion held by police that the victim’s disappearance was suspicious, let alone that he had been murdered, and the appellant was not a suspect in any way concerning his disappearance. As the primary judge found, without the appellant’s admissions to police there was no prospect of the murder or of the appellant’s involvement in it coming to light. Nor, in the absence of his taking police to the burial site, was there a prospect that the body would be located.
	


Subjective features


	
	Tendered on the sentence proceedings was the appellant’s criminal record, together with reports of Anita Duffy (psychologist) and a number of testimonials. His Honour also had available to him (by consent) reports of Drs Westmore, Allnut and Reid (psychiatrists) and Dr Susan Pulman (psychologist). The effect of these reports (as to which there is no issue) was summarised in the reasons of the primary judge as follows. The appellant was aged 35 years at the date of sentence, one of four sons, having two older brothers and a non-identical twin brother. He was living at home with his parents until his imprisonment. He told Ms Duffy that his parents were “very excitable and negative people” and remembered fights and arguments between them since he was young. Although he was not physically abused, he was continually on edge by their fighting and his father would often scream at him. He completed school at year 10, leaving when he was 16 years of age, then worked in a factory and later at a fruit market. He has also worked as a builder’s labourer and was self-employed as a handyman. He has always been employed since leaving school. Although he told Drs Allnutt, Reid and Pulman that he had been smoking marijuana and using amphetamines since he was 14 or 16, he told Ms Duffy he had never used illicit drugs. He told all of those who examined him that he started drinking at about 14 or 16, often to intoxication. The relationship he had with Sharon Shafique was his first serious relationship. He was with her for two to three years and they lived together for about 12 months. Ms Duffy administered various psychometric tests. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence placed him in the Low Average range at 85 and his scores in the Vocabulary and the Similarities subtests indicated relatively limited word knowledge, verbal expression and a tendency to think in rather concrete terms. Testing of basic personality characteristics revealed a strong Depressive feature as well as Dependent, Passive/Aggressive and Self-Defeating traits. Ms Duffy said –
	


“Mr Panetta's profile indicates an enduring pattern of thoughts, attitudes, behaviours and self-concepts related to depression. He may perceive himself as worthless, vulnerable, inadequate, unsuccessful and guilty and may frequently engage in self-criticism. He tends to view events in his life in a defeatist or fatalistic manner, expecting the worst. The Negativistic or Passive/Aggressive elevation flavours his depression with some resentment. He may vacillate between being bitter and resentful towards others versus being intropunitive and self-deprecatory.

The Dependent elevation indicates a strong need for affection and support by others, and therefore, to gain approval, [he] tends to be submissive and conciliatory rather than assertive or argumentative. He looks to others to lead and care for him and in this way gives up responsibility for making decisions. Underlying his insecurity are feelings of low self-esteem. In his eagerness for acceptance and approval, he can be extremely agreeable and submissive, subjugating his own needs to those of others. He may be perceived as gullible, humble, docile and passive, and therefore more vulnerable to manipulation or domination by others. Internally, he may have a limited range of competencies in reducing tension and stressors.”


	
	On other scales, the appellant’s results lay just below significance on measures of Thought Disorder and Major Depression.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt noted that, when the appellant had confessed to the police, he had demonstrated significant symptoms of depression in the wake of the incident, according to him, “as a consequence of unresolved feelings of guilt” but by the time he came to be examined, these symptoms had ameliorated somewhat. He was taking antidepressants daily. He experienced mild panic attacks that had started when he was incarcerated. Dr Pulman, a clinical neuropsychologist and forensic psychologist, administered a number of tests. These showed his current intellectual functioning fell within the low average to average range at the fourth percentile. His General Ability Index fell in the low average range at the tenth percentile. There was some variability in the sub-test scores with his performance varying from Borderline on the task of non-verbal conceptual reasoning to Superior in the task of immediate attention span. His scores on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) were in the Extremely Severe range but these were inconsistent with his presentation during interviews. She did not find that he was not endeavouring to do his best, although Dr Reid found that the score achieved by the appellant showed he was not performing to the best of his ability. Dr Reid found that the appellant scored in the extremely low range for non-verbal intellectual functions (63), placing him at the first percentile for persons of similar age. He presented with depressed mood, was slow in his responses, his affect was flat and he offered little in the way of spontaneous speech. Dr Reid thought that the appellant appeared to have longstanding problems with attention, low self-esteem and a past history of drug and alcohol abuse. He was of the opinion that the appellant’s depression was having a significant impact on his cognitive abilities.
	
	
	As the primary judge noted, some caution needs to be adopted concerning these reports since, except for Ms Duffy’s, they were assessments designed to see whether the appellant was fit to stand trial. Nevertheless, his Honour concluded that, in general terms, they disclosed fairly similar pictures of the offender and were informative.
	
	
	Ms Duffy had noted that the appellant expressed remorse and regret about his actions. His Honour found that, although the appellant did not give evidence and therefore such expressions needed to be considered with care, they were entirely consistent not only with his confession but also with what had happened since. His Honour stated that his observations of him during the sentencing hearing served to confirm that he was extremely remorseful for what he had done.
	
	
	As to the appellant’s criminal history, this was inconsequential and did not disentitle him from being considered to be a person of prior good character.
	


Findings as to the circumstances


	
	The primary judge found that the appellant did not set out with the intention of killing the deceased but, rather, to abduct and rob him. It was whilst he was trying to restrain the deceased that the latter obtained a hammer and struck the appellant, at which point he grabbed the hammer and hit the deceased repeatedly in the head. His Honour thought that this was “perhaps about 15 times”, an approximation taken from the appellant’s admissions. It will be recalled that two fractures, indicating blows of considerable force, were found on autopsy, the force of the other blows is unknown. His Honour concluded that the appellant must have intended to cause grievous bodily harm but could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to kill the deceased, rather, he was trying to subdue him to further his purpose of abducting and robbing him. The assault arose spontaneously without planning or premeditation.
	
	
	The primary judge accepted that the actions that led up to the murder (and, as I understand it, the murder itself) were unlikely to have occurred had it not been for the low intelligence and personal problems suffered by the applicant, who was obviously vulnerable and suggestible. His Honour pointed out that Ms Shafique, who provided the false information about the victim, was his first and only serious relationship and, in addition to his gullibility, he was (it appeared) endeavouring to please her, bearing in mind that he had no prior knowledge of him. His Honour summed up the position by observing “the deceased was an entirely innocent man who had become the victim of his ex-wife's obsession or vindictiveness or both, and the stupidity and criminality of the offender.” So far as subjective features are concerned, I have mentioned the psychiatric and psychological material that was before the primary judge which, in substance, his Honour accepted. His Honour concluded that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	None of these matters are disputed.
	


Ground of Appeal 2


	
	Since I am of the view that this must be allowed, with the consequence that the sentence is effected by an error of law, the Court must itself resentence the appellant (see Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601; 238 A Crim R 134). The Court must therefore also consider for itself the appropriate discount to be allowed for the appellant’s plea of guilty and the assistance to the authorities arising from his disclosure of the offence (the issues raised by grounds 1 and 3) as well as the significance of the evidence concerning the appellant’s intellectual functioning (raised by ground 4). It is therefore not necessary to deal with these grounds.
	
	
	This ground of appeal is based on the submission that the primary judge did not comply with s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which, so far as may be relevant, is as follows –
	


“(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2) In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(b) the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d) the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g) whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h) any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5) Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.

101A Effect of failure to comply with Act

A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence.

(All references to legislation are to this Act unless otherwise specified.)


	
	Section 23(4), (5) and (6) were inserted in the Act in 2010, becoming effective on 14 March 2011. Section 101A was in the Act at the time, having been inserted in 2002, effective from 17 February 2003. The purpose of s 23(4) was generally understood to be that as explained in the judgment of Johnson J in R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [75] as applying to the situation where a discount was given for assistance to the authorities in respect of offences by another offender, part of which related to an undertaking to give further assistance (usually by giving evidence at the other offender’s trial), to facilitate a reconsideration of the reduced sentence should the Crown appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in the event that the respondent failed to fulfil the undertaking. It was not understood to apply to reduction in the sentence otherwise appropriate because the offender had voluntarily disclosed his commission of an offence – the so called Ellis discount, after R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603.
	
	
	Here, the primary judge followed what was the preponderant view in this Court (contrary to my own: see Raad v R [2011] NSWCCA 138; Ehrlich at [28]ff; R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; 167 A Crim R 436 at [116]ff), that “the weight of authority suggests that any Ellis discount should not be specified” by reference to R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] per Howie J, R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 where Basten JA (with whom Price and SG Campbell JJ agreed on this aspect) referred to Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [15] to suggest that it was not appropriate to give any numerical indication as to the degree of leniency which should be accorded and, lastly, a passage in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [34]. However, this matter requires reconsideration in light of the decision in CMB v Attorney General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9, which was delivered on 11 March 2015 (four days after the judgment under appeal). Amongst other things, the appeal in CMB involved the question whether an Ellis discount fell within s 23(3). French CJ and Gageler J said –
	


“[41 … [The Ellis discount] now finds statutory expression in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 22 of which concerns confession of guilt, and s 23 of which encompasses the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities including by disclosure of the commission of an offence. In each of these circumstances, by operation of ss 22(1) and 23(1) respectively, a sentencing court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose …”

Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ (at [71]) pointed to s 23 of the Act as allowing the Court to impose a lesser penalty than otherwise where the offender has “assisted (or undertaken to assist) law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection, or investigation of the offence (or any other offence)”, whilst s 23(3) limits the extent of the reduction.


	
	Once it is accepted that the Ellis assistance falls within s 23(1), it necessarily falls within the other sub-sections, in particular s 23(4), imposing on the Court the requirement, in substance, to make explicit the nature and extent of any reduction of the sentence from that which otherwise would have been imposed absent the assistance. The mere fact, as pointed out by the Crown prosecutor, that the Court in CMB did not refer to sub-s 23(4), does not affect this reasoning.
	
	
	What then is the effect of an omission to do so? At face value, s 23(6), in providing that the failure of a court to comply with s 23(4) “does not invalidate the sentence”, might suggest that the error should be regarded merely as a “process” error, and not such as would affect the legal propriety of the sentence itself. However, whatever subsection 23(6) means, s 101A permits the court to consider a failure to comply with it “in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence”. The relationship between a provision such as subsection 23(6) and s 101A was adverted to in R v Tuncbilek [2004] NSWCCA 139 though the error there, to my mind, was of somewhat greater significance, since it directly affected the way that the sentence itself needed to be considered as distinct from the situation here where we are dealing with the way in which the sentence should be expressed. Simpson J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed) said –
	


“[33] Error has plainly been demonstrated in the sentencing of the appellant in relation to the second offence, in the failure to advert to the new sentencing regime. The Crown drew attention to s54B(5) of the Sentencing Procedure Act which provides that the failure of a court to comply with the section does not invalidate the sentence. However, it also acknowledged that, by s101A, failure to comply with a provision of the Act may be considered by an appeal court in an appeal against sentence even if the Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence. I accept the submission on behalf of the appellant, to the effect that the proper interpretation of s54B(5) is to preserve sentences imposed otherwise than in accordance with the Sentencing Procedure Act unless the subject of appeal. S54B(5) does not preclude this Court finding error where there is demonstrated non-compliance with the provisions of the Sentencing Procedure Act.”


	
	It seems to me that the failure to comply with subsection 23(4) is an error of law affecting the sentence which requires this Court to consider the issue of resentencing under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). First, the subsection is in obligatory terms; secondly, it is not possible for this Court to correct the omission since the reasons of the primary judge do not indicate which penalty “would otherwise have [been] imposed’ as required by par 23(4)(b). Furthermore, this is not information merely for the public record but information to which, it is clear, the offender has a right. The only way by which that right can be vindicated, let alone the public record corrected, is by this Court resentencing in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Nor, in my view, is this a matter of mere technicality. Rather, the subsection reflects important public policy considerations. Whilst recognising that many of the relevant factors are incommensurable, as a matter of important general principle, the process which leads to the imposition of a particular sentence of imprisonment should be as transparent as circumstances permit. Where particular aspects are commensurable, there are at least three good reasons for specifying them and no good reasons for declining to do so: first, it is a fundamental aspect of the administration of justice that judicial decisions are explained in a way that enables not only the parties but also the public to understand both the process and the outcome, especially in cases dealing with the liberty of the subject; secondly, where there is a right of appeal, unless the process is adequately explained, the appeal court is inhibited in undertaking its own responsibilities in respect of the case and, since appeals concern not only outcome but also process, the latter needs to be sufficiently clear for the court to do its job; and, thirdly as this court identified in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, there is a distinct public interest in ensuring, so far as is possible, that persons considering whether they should go to trial will have a rational basis for giving appropriate consideration to the relevant issues, including the potential effect on their sentence – in the case of a plea of guilty the same reasoning applies with even greater force where the question being considered is whether a person will come forward to confess involvement in a crime.
	
	
	It follows that the sentence here is affected by an error of law requiring the Court to consider whether, in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, “some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	It is not controversial in the present appeal that the primary judge’s conclusion that the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm rather than to kill the victim was open to his Honour. I am of the same view and it follows that the appellant falls to be sentenced on the basis that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm. Although it will not invariably be the case, this intention is taken to be less heinous than the intention to kill and should be so treated (as, indeed, was done by the primary judge) in this case. The primary judge also concluded that the appellant had not planned to grievously injure the deceased but, rather, had intended to restrain and rob him. Again this is not presently controversial and I would come to the same conclusion. The victim, whilst the appellant was attempting to restrain him, managed to grab hold of a hammer and struck the appellant with it. The appellant took the hammer from him and hit the victim repeatedly in the head. Whether this was the 15 times which the appellant told the police was probable is, I think, uncertain but perhaps does not matter much. I would infer that the appellant hit the victim many more times than was necessary to subdue him, very likely because he had to some degree lost his self-control. This assault was impulsive and not premeditated.
	
	
	There is, of course, no such thing as a murder of slight seriousness; all murders are gravely serious. Nevertheless, it is plain that there is a range of moral and criminal culpability. Without implying that this question admits of any precision, I would place the objective seriousness of this offence as significantly below the middle of the range.
	


The plea


	
	This was a matter of controversy in the appeal, the first ground submitting that the primary judge erred in the exercise of the discretion as to the appropriate discount to be allowed.
	
	
	The appellant had pleaded guilty on the second business day before the trial was due to begin, having been committed to this Court for sentence on 12 March 2012. The matter was adjourned several times, until 7 September 2012 when it was indicated that the charge was to be defended. As the primary judge found, some of the delay in that period resulted from issues with legal aid and the appellant’s legal representation. On 7 September 2012 the matter was set down for trial on 2 April 2013. On 15 March 2013 the legal representative of the appellant indicated that fitness to plea and diminished responsibility might be in issue and, on 20 March 2013 the trial date was vacated on the appellant’s application to enable a psychiatric assessment as to the possibility of diminished responsibility to be obtained. Reports were obtained in due course and on 14 May 2013 a new trial date was fixed of 18 November 2013. Further reports received on 28 October 2013 for the appellant and on 7 November 2013 from the Crown affectively disposed of any realistic possibility that the defence of diminished responsibility might be available and, as mentioned, the appellant pleaded guilty on 14 November 2013. In R v Thomson; R v Houlton Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Foster AJA, Grove and James JJ agreed) stated, in his conclusion (at [160]) –
	


“(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.”

His Honour had earlier stated –

“[155] The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, eg, on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial.”


	
	The chronology of events needs to be examined in somewhat greater detail. The following is taken largely from the submissions of Mr Dhanji SC and Ms Hutchinson, counsel for the appellant, but I apprehend that it is not controversial and is a convenient summary.
	


• On 12 November 2010 the appellant voluntary disclosed his responsibility for the killing.

• On 18 December 2011 Professor Coyle provided a report which, inter alia, assessed the appellant's IQ as 74, in the low normal range of intellectual functioning, based on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). (Subsequently, Drs Reid and Pulman disagreed with Professor Coyle's designation of the appellant's IQ, pointing out that an IQ of 74 is considered to be at the bottom of the borderline range (70 – 84).

• On 12 March 2012 the appellant, having pleaded guilty in the Local Court, was committed for sentence.

• On 5 April, 4 May, 1 June and 6 July the matter was listed for arraignment.

• On 3 September 2012 Ms Duffy provided a report which assessed the appellant's IQ at the Low Average range based on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (1999) WASI and as having a strongly depressive feature as well as Dependent, Passive/Aggressive and Self-Defeating Traits. There were indications that he ""had experienced past episodes of profound depression to the extent of having suicidal thoughts”.

• On 7 September 2012 the matter was set down for trial on 2 April 2013.

• On 15 March 2013 the matter was mentioned and it was indicated that fitness and substantial impairment may be in issue.

• 19 March 2013 the ODPP requested an assessment from Dr Allnutt of the appellant's fitness to stand trial.

• On 20 March 2013 there was an application to vacate the trial date of 2 April so that the offender could be psychiatrically assessed as to the possibility of diminished responsibility. The trial date was vacated. The report of Dr Allnutt concerning fitness was still outstanding.

• On 19 April 2013 Dr Allnutt saw the appellant at the Long Bay Hospital.

• On 24 April 2013 Dr Allnutt reported the appellant fit to stand trial and reserved his opinion as to his mental state at the material time, recommending neuropsychological testing with an emphasis on executive functioning be carried out.

• By 10 May 2013 Dr Westmore was satisfied of the appellant's fitness to stand trial.

• On 14 May 2013 the matter was listed for trial on 18 November 2013.

• On 30 August 2013 the ODPP requested Dr Pulman undertake a neuropsychological assessment of the appellant.

• On 16 October 2013 Dr Reid assessed the appellant at Long Bay Correctional Centre at the request of the appellant's solicitor. Due to considerable noise and time constraints, a detailed neuropsychological assessment was not possible.

• On 16 and 28 October 2013 Dr Pulman interviewed and assessed the appellant at Long Bay Hospital.

• On 28 October 2013 Dr Reid reported that the appellant's premorbid level of intellectual ability was within the average range, his non-verbal intellectual functions in the extremely low range (1st percentile for persons of a similar age) and overall intellectual ability as significantly below the premorbid estimate. He concluded that there was no issue of diminished responsibility, but that the appellant's level of depression was having a significant impact on his cognitive abilities and level of effort in performing cognitive tasks and was ""of sufficient severity to affect his cognitive functioning and fitness for standing trial."" Dr Reid recommended further psychiatric assessment, this time with a focus on his depression.

• On 7 November 2013 Dr Pulman provided a report in which she assessed the appellant's overall intellectual functioning as within the Low Average range and at the 12th percentile, based on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). She expressed this functioning as “at a level equal to or better than 12 per cent of the normal population on this test”. Dr Pulman concluded that the appellant was fit to stand trial, was not, at the time of her report suffering from a mental illness and that there was no evidence he had sustained a significant brain injury in his past which could have impacted on his capacity to form intent or have reduced his mental capacity to any significant extent.

• On 14 November 2013 the appellant was arraigned and entered a plea of guilty.


	
	The investigations and reports by Dr Reid and Dr Pulman concerned matters potentially relevant to both the issues of unfitness and substantial impairment. The report of Dr Allnutt as to fitness was not to hand as at 20 March 2013 when the defence applied successfully to have the trial date of 2 April 2013 vacated. Although it might be true that the question of substantial impairment had initially been raised by the defence, Dr Allnutt – who had been retained by the Director of Public Prosecutions – had recommended that further investigations be conducted in relation to this issue. It took almost two months to resolve the fitness and substantial impairment issues between 15 March 2013 when the potential of their being an issue concerning fitness was raised and the setting of a second trial on 14 May 2013. The fitness issue was not resolved until 7 November 2013.
	
	
	It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that, to the extent to which delay was occasioned by the resolution of the fitness issue, this ought not to have reduced the discount which was otherwise appropriate. It is submitted that fitness is an issue that is “non-adversarial” in nature: ss 6, 11 and 12 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW); R v Krbavac [2013] NSWSC 313 per Price J at [6]. The obligation to raise fitness binds both parties, even in spite of instructions to the contrary: Eastman v R [2000] 203 CLR 1 at [297] (per Hayne J). Reliance was also placed on Hawkins v R [2011] NSWCCA 153, where delay attributable to considering the question of the offender’s mental illness was, in effect, disregarded.
	
	
	To my mind it is of vital importance to consider the context in which pleas of guilty occur to charges as serious of murder. First, a plea of guilty to murder should be looked at with a considerable degree of caution if the offender is legally unrepresented and it would be necessary for the court to take steps to ensure, so far as was practicably possible, that the accused was adequately aware of the import of the indictment including the elements of the charge. Secondly, it would be to my mind remiss in the extreme for a legal representative to advise an offender to plead guilty where there was a real risk that a question of mental fitness needed to be explored, without first obtaining the medical information essential to that advice. It is self-evident that offenders may be – and in this case the appellant certainly was – unable to adequately assess their own mental condition. Of course, where no such issue arises and the facts are sufficiently known to and understood by the offender, a plea may readily be the subject of sensible advice. The mere fact that in this case the result of the medical enquiries was that the appellant was fit to be tried and no defence of diminished responsibility was available did not mean that it was unnecessary for appropriate enquiries to be made, as occurred. It is not suggested by the Crown that those enquiries were inappropriate or in some way a mere fishing exercise or unreasonably delayed. To my mind, it appears they were undertaken with reasonable promptitude. It would be most unfortunate if necessary medical enquiries in a case such as this were not made because of the fear that a delay in pleading guilty would lead to a significant loss of the discount that otherwise would be available. In the nature of things, of course, it was necessary that the Crown obtain its own advice, which it did. As I see the matter, it is very different when the delay is the result of negotiations between Crown and defence for lesser charges or less culpable facts, though it is not every case of this kind which would justify a reduction in the discount.
	
	
	Where it is reasonable to apprehend that mental illness or diminished responsibility might be relevant, as in this case, it is not practicably or professionally responsible to advise on the appropriateness of a plea in the absence of appropriate expert opinion. I note that it appears that, although Professor Coyle thought that the appellant was fit to plead, he is not a psychiatrist and the view was reasonably taken that the issue was one which required psychiatric opinion, which was obtained; indeed, Dr Allnutt was of the view that such enquires should occur. He also recommended psycho-neurological testing, which was then undertaken. In relation to impecunious defendants such as the appellant, the obtaining of these reports is a matter for the Legal Aid Commission and it seems that some delay was occasioned by the need to seek a grant of legal aid for those purposes. It should also be borne in mind, I think, that although there might be – indeed there ultimately was – a dispute about whether the appellant intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, there was no real dispute about the salient facts, for which the appellant was for practical purposes the sole source. The Crown was not placed in the position where an array of witnesses were needed to be kept on hold pending the outcome of the arraignment and it is not suggested here that there was any expense whether of time or money in this regard. It is apparent that the Crown case, in terms of the admissions, the location and identification of the body and the results of the autopsy were never in dispute.
	
	
	In my view, the appropriate discount is 20 per cent. In saying this, of course, I should not be taken to suggest that the primary judge erred in assessing the appropriate discount at 10 per cent. I should make it clear that, despite my own view, if the question needed to be determined as a ground of appeal, I would have concluded that his Honour’s discretion had not miscarried.
	


The Ellis discount


	
	I discussed this question at some length in Raad. The Bench in that case agreed that the appeal should be upheld for the reasons expressed in my judgment but McClellan CJ at CL and Button J did not agree with me on the issue of whether a finding of special circumstances should be made within the meaning of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act such as to require an adjustment of what might be called the default ratio specified by that section: I thought there were special circumstances that justified such a reduction of the non-parole period but my colleagues did not. In dealing with the issue upon which the Bench was agreed, I discussed the policy considerations relevant to assessing the appropriate discount in an Ellis situation and referred to the cases of murder where this question had arisen. My views are unchanged and I have therefore adopted the convenient course of setting out in this judgment what I said in Raad –
	


“[19] The learned sentencing judge found that, in addition to the maximum discount for his plea of guilty, the appellant was entitled to a significant added element of leniency for his voluntary disclosure of involvement in serious crimes of which the police had no knowledge, citing the well known authority of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. His Honour also cited the following passage from the judgment of McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 –

‘[12] Thus, according to Ellis , the degree of leniency to be shown for the disclosure of unknown offences will vary according to (1) the likelihood that the offences would have been discovered by the authorities; and (2) the likelihood that the offences could have been proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court without the disclosure.’

The learned sentencing judge added –

‘20 Nevertheless, however significant the Ellis factors ought to be, the sentence imposed cannot fall below that which is appropriate for the seriousness of the crime.’ [Emphasis added.]

[20] It is important, in my respectful opinion, to bear in mind that (what might conveniently be called) an Ellis situation gives rise to two distinct matters that need to be taken into account. First, it informs the assessment of remorse and contrition and reduces, potentially to insignificance, the requirement for personal deterrence. It seems to me it also reduces the materiality of general deterrence, since it would be directed to that miniscule class of individuals minded to commit crimes and then admit to them. At the same time, the notions of retribution and denunciation are undoubtedly still of considerable importance. But they are only a part of the answer to the question, ‘What does this particular offender deserve?’ and are necessarily affected, whether favourably or adversely to the offender, by the whole of the circumstances including - as is typical of the Ellis cases - the marked change in the character and personal attributes of the person being sentenced as distinct from the way that person was when the crime was committed. This is no more than noting the incommensurable character of the factors forming the instinctive synthesis which is ultimately expressed in the sentence. These considerations may be usefully termed the ‘Ellis personal features’.

[21] A second very significant factor in Ellis cases is the policy of the law that offenders should be encouraged to come forward, a rather more objective and distinct matter than the personal attributes of the particular offender and his or her motivations. Thus, in Ellis , Street CJ at 604 said –

‘When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing Judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.

The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.’ [Emphasis added.]

This passage was cited with approval by McHugh J in Ryan.

[22] Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the sentence which is proposed to be passed would be likely to encourage a guilty person to come forward as distinct, of course, to deter him or her from doing so. This matter may be termed the ‘Ellis policy feature’. With respect, I am unsure whether the significance of this feature is encompassed by the learned sentencing judge's statement of principle quoted above that “the sentence imposed cannot fall below that which is appropriate for the seriousness of the crime”, language reflective of conventional considerations applying to sentencing, although including the Ellis factors as justifying a considerable degree of leniency.

[23] On the face of it, a confession of the kind made by the appellant is well within s23 of the Crimes (Criminal Procedure) Act 1999, sub-s(1) of which reads –

“A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.”

The “offence concerned” is the particular offence for which the offender is to be sentenced, a point made clear by para 23(2)(i). The application of this provision was not brought to the sentencing judge's attention and his Honour did not refer to it. This may be of little matter since the section appears to state the common law. However, s23(3) makes it clear that the limitation on the extent to which the sentence might be reduced under this head is such that the sentence will “not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence” (emphasis added). The assumption made by the Parliament is, therefore, that the resulting sentence will be ""disproportionate"" but requires that it be not “unreasonably” so.

[24] Clearly the assessment in any particular case whether the disproportion is unreasonable is a matter of judgment upon which reasonable minds may differ. One of the matters that should be borne in mind, as I think, is that, since the expected sentence is lengthened as the seriousness of the crime increases, the graver the crime the greater the inducement to remain silent, so that the discount given to encourage confession must be all the greater in absolute terms. This consideration, of course, is made in the context that, had the offender not come forward and confessed, he or she (in a case such as the present) would not be facing any punishment at all. This is in marked contrast with the case where an offender decides to assist the authorities in respect of the criminal activities of another. He or she is already facing punishment. I do not underestimate the personal risks that some such informants can face. However, someone in the appellant's position was facing sure and substantial punishment as against no punishment at all.

[25] Even though the offender in this situation is almost invariably motivated by very strong feelings of remorse, the likelihood of a heavy sentence will obviously operate as a considerable, probably decisive, deterrent; if he or she is to be encouraged to come forward, it is self-evident that the sentence must be considerably lessened. Perhaps this is to say little more than Street CJ said in Ellis about the need to extend “considerable” leniency in these cases. I simply point out that, to be effective, this leniency might well need to be very considerable indeed. It hardly needs to be added that the mere fact that in any particular case the offender is - at least at the time of confession - indifferent to the length of the sentence that might be meted out is irrelevant. The policy is directed to those offenders who are minded to confess by their feelings of guilt, and might be encouraged to come forward by the considerable leniency they could expect. For the reasons I explain below, I am of the respectful opinion that the leniency extended to the appellant was by a substantial margin less than the principle in Ellis required.

Other Ellis cases

[26] Before moving to a discussion of the way in which the sentencing judge calculated the sentences here, it is useful, as it seems to me, to look at previous cases of murder where Ellis considerations applied. Not surprisingly, they are rare. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the rarity is, at least in part, due to an apprehension that a resulting sentence is likely to be severe, even though probably much less severe than the conventional applicable sentence.

[27] In R v Bawden (unreported, NSWSC 30 October 1992) the offender walked into a police station and confessed to a murder committed 17 years previously for which the victim's husband had been wrongly convicted. It became clear that his confession was genuine and that it was motivated by his feelings of guilt about the killing. The offender had only become aware of the husband's conviction a few days earlier. Although there were some doubts at first about the genuineness of the confession, following an enquiry under s475 of the Crimes Act 1900 the husband was pardoned and the offender was charged and convicted on his plea of guilty. The circumstances of the crime were particularly serious. The appellant, then 22 years of age and under considerable personal stress, forced his way into the victim's home when she answered his knock at the door. She was a stranger. When she started to scream and a struggle started he took a shirt and wrapped it around her neck, tightening it as she continued to struggle. When she stopped struggling he dragged her down the hall into the bedroom, by which time she was probably dead. Although a sexual motive was suspected, the appellant denied this and claimed he had only intended to steal property from the house. Matthews J accepted that this was so. Her Honour found that the offence was ‘quite out of character’ and noted that he had attempted suicide on three or four subsequent occasions. Her Honour thought that these attempts, his transient life style, and difficulties with relationships were a product of his guilt about the killing and accepted that this had preyed on his mind from the beginning. She found that it was his desire to put his life in order and the need to be punished for his crime that motivated him to hand himself into police and make his confession. Although the motivation for the killing was baffling in light of the offender's character, Matthews J found that it was an isolated act of violence and there was no danger of his reoffending.

[28] Matthews J held that the lapse of time was not a mitigating feature since it arose from his own failure to come forward but commented that ‘it is impossible to ignore the fact that that the prisoner ...is an entirely different man from the person who [committed the murder] almost twenty years ago. Time and guilt have taken their toll upon him’. Her Honour accepted that the confession was telling evidence of remorse. There was no prospect of his guilt being suspected, let alone known. Accordingly, her Honour held that ‘he is deserving of substantial leniency ... [not only because] his action indicate[s] extreme contrition in a subjective sense but it is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage guilty people to come forward and disclose their guilt ... [and the] only way that this can be done is by extending leniency to those who do so’.

[29] Commenting that “I need hardly say that this case presents special circumstances which entitle me to vary the proportions [between the minimum and total terms]”. Matthews J imposed a sentence of fifteen years with a minimum term of eight years.

[30] In R v MHN [1998] NSWSC 533, the offender killed the deceased, in the course of a “cowardly attack by four persons against [the victim]”. His skull was fractured by kicks inflicted by the offender and unconscious or semi-conscious, he was taken to the premises occupied by one of the assailants, and, following an unsuccessful attempt to strangle him, his throat was cut by the offender, who was only 17 years of age at the time. The body was taken away and left on a nearby building site. The offender and his victim had known each other for some time and there was considerable (unexplained) ill-feeling between them. [The injuries, ultimately fatal, were inflicted with “cool premeditation”. In part the motivation was the elimination of a witness who threated to go to the police. The offender suffered from long term undiagnosed depression. He was a suspect but had not been charged when he confessed to his involvement in the offence. Investigations were continuing. He was sentenced to 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years.]

[31] In R v McCabe (unreported, NSWCCA 14 October 1991) the offender's sentence following a plea of guilty to murder of twenty years imprisonment with a minimum term of fifteen years was reduced on appeal to sixteen years with a minimum term of nine years. The deceased, an elderly woman, died in her unit following the infliction of seven stab wounds. Although the appellant was interviewed in the course of the police investigation as she had moved into an adjacent unit the day before the killing, her statement that she was absent from the building at the time was accepted by police and she was discounted as a suspect. About two and a half years later the offender, accompanied by a solicitor, walked into a police station and said that she believed she might have been responsible for the killing. The offender told police at first that she had been given entry into the unit and the victim had threatened her with a knife when she was stealing money from a wall unit. She claimed the victim was fatally stabbed in the ensuing struggle. She said that she was ‘hanging out’ for drugs, though not intoxicated and discovered the victim was dead when she read of it in the newspaper a few days later. She had no explanation for the seven stab wounds that were inflicted. In due course, she was committed for trial. Shortly after, the offender made a second statement to police, saying that she was heavily intoxicated on the night in question and had little memory of what happened. She admitted taking the knife to the unit when she had gone there to return the victim's umbrella but had no idea why she had the knife with her. Although she remembered stabbing the victim twice in the neck and throat, she could not recall why. The offender then changed her plea to guilty of murder. She did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. The sentencing judge's findings that the offender was not significantly intoxicated at the time of the crime but that she was suffering from a mental disorder occasioned by prolonged drug abuse associated with an appallingly sad personal background were accepted on appeal as were his Honour's findings that she had made very significant steps towards rehabilitation.

[32] Matthews J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Carruthers J agreed) observed that the sentence imposed at first instance was ‘on any view of the matter... a lengthy term of imprisonment for murder’, pointing to the range of sentences for murder that had recently been passed, the highest of which was one of twenty four years with a minimum term of fifteen years for a murder described by her Honour as ‘a much more serious matter"" both objectively and subjectively than the crime under appeal. Her Honour said that other serious cases of murder which did not have ""substantial mitigating features’ resulted in sentences ‘roughly similar’ to the appellant's, thus it fell ‘within the upper range of sentences for murder over recent years’. Although the objective circumstances were ‘very serious indeed’ her Honour pointed to the appellant's strong subjective case, which included physical and sexual abuse as a child. She was only nineteen years of age at the time of the crime, with a minor criminal history. Matthews J concluded that the sentencing judge had given inadequate weight to the appellant's remorse, which had been somewhat diminished by the conflicting accounts of the offence, but compellingly demonstrated by her having come forward to confess when there was no prospect of being apprehended. Her Honour added –

‘In my view, the fact that the appellant came forward and confessed to the killing two and a half years after the event should be given considerable weight upon sentence. Not only did it provide graphic evidence of the appellant's remorse in a subjective sense, but there is also a policy consideration involved.’ [citing Ellis ibid at 604, emphasis added.]

Her Honour considered that there was ‘compelling evidence of special circumstances’ comprising the appellant's ‘most difficult and unusual background ... leading to an altered mental state at the time of the killing ... her youth ... the fact that she gave herself up ... and ... the very strong evidence of her rehabilitation ...’ thus justifying the minimum term of nine years. I would point out that the fact that all of these factors were relevant also in determining the total sentence did not prevent them from being again considered for the purpose of determining whether they also warranted a variation of the statutory ratio, a matter to which I return.

[33] In R v Baldacchino [1998] NSWSC 723 the offender murdered one Joseph Farrugia in August 1985. After becoming a Jehovah's Witness in October 1995 and telling his wife and Elders of the congregation in April 1997 of his commission of the crime, he went to the police in May 1997 and made a full confession. The objective circumstances were particularly serious. His then girlfriend had been ordered as part of a property settlement to pay $20,000 to Joseph Farrugia, her ex-husband. The couple unsuccessfully attempted to procure two persons to kill him and then, on her instigation, the offender planned to kill Farrugia himself by using a .22 rifle the barrel of which he shortened and machined to accept a silencer. On the night of the crime, he had been drinking quite heavily and went to the victim's house, entering through a window forced open with a screwdriver, but the victim was not at home. He left and returned about 30 minutes later. Seeing the victim's car in the driveway, he reentered through the window, discovered the victim asleep in bed, put the rifle to his head and shot him. He then disposed of the rifle and other items that may have been contaminated with blood. The offender married his girlfriend the following year but the marriage was short and they separated after a couple of years, divorcing in 1996. In about 1989 he turned to religion and became increasingly troubled in his conscience by Farrugia's murder. The sentencing judge accepted that he had been suffering from severe depression at the time of the killing, which condition had continued to affect him episodically ever since, though improving somewhat with his religious conversion. In addition to his own confession, the offender agreed to assist the authorities in the prosecution of charges against his ex-wife. But for his confession there was no prospect that he would have been identified as the killer.

[34] The sentencing judge found that the offender's expressions of remorse and contrition were genuine and deeply felt and that, except for the killing of Farrugia, he was not a violent man.

[35] The sentencing judge categorised the murder as a ‘cold-blooded assassination’ primarily to satisfy his girlfriend's greed, involving the invasion of the victim's home. His Honour accepted that s442B of the Crimes Act 1900 concerning assistance to the authorities (now repealed and replaced by sec 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) applied to the case, noting that sub-s (2) prohibited a reduction to the sentence ‘so that the sentence becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence’. The offender was sentenced to a minimum term of eight years with an additional term of eight years. The special circumstances comprised ‘the possible effect of such a lengthy sentence on the existing and expected rehabilitation, the estrangement from the prisoner's church where there appear to be no other family or friend support mechanisms operating and the likelihood that custodial circumstances would be harsher because of the assistance that the prisoner has rendered to authorities [together with] an extended period of supervision ... in both the prisoner's and the community interest’.

[36] In R v JSK [2004] NSWSC 470 the offender, not being a suspect, handed himself into police almost three years after he murdered the deceased and confessed his guilt. At the date of the crime he was 16 years of age and his victim was 17. About a week earlier, he and MH (just short of 18), who were members of a circle of friends that included the deceased, discussed killing him as he was becoming involved with MH's girlfriend. The three youths drove to an area of bushland in MH's car. MH struck the deceased with a piece of timber picked up from the ground, the offender hit and kicked him until he was unconscious and the two then dropped a large log several times onto his head until they believed he was dead. He was buried in a shallow grave dug with a shovel brought for that purpose. The offender took the deceased's wallet and mobile phone and hid them.

[37] Buddin J summarised the objective circumstances as follows –

‘[9] Whilst the offender must be given credit for his obvious candour in disclosing the details of the events that led to the death of the deceased, the fact remains that this was a cowardly and cold-blooded killing perpetrated upon a young man who would have had absolutely no reason to suspect that he was to be murdered by two of his friends. Moreover, the offence was committed in company and there was at least a degree of premeditation about it. Certainly by the time that MH arrived at the offender's place with the deceased in his car on the day of his death, the offender was well aware that MH intended carrying out his stated intention to kill the deceased and that he was expected to participate in MH's plan to do so.’

[38] Buddin J accepted expert evidence that the offender was somewhat more immature for his age than normal and was thus more vulnerable to the influence of MH than might otherwise have been the case. His background was appalling, having been abused from an early age by his natural parents who were intellectually disabled. Having been placed in foster care, he was eventually adopted when he was 12 and lost contact with his parents, which caused considerable distress. He was genuinely remorseful and his coming forward was prompted by strong feelings of guilt. Whilst in custody he had made substantial progress in his personal development. An additional material factor was the offender's willingness to give evidence against MH. He had no prior criminal convictions and was otherwise a person of good character. He was most unlikely to reoffend. When transferred ultimately to adult prison he would need to be placed in protection.

[39] The offender was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years. The special circumstances ""in particular"" comprised the fact that the offender had not previously been in gaol and that, upon release, he would require considerable supervision and assistance to facilitate his reintegration into the community.

[40] (For completeness I should mention R v Harris [2000] NSWSC 285 and R v Barker [2001] NSWSC 295, but these cases are for various reasons so different from the present as not to be of any real assistance.)”


	
	To this list of examples should be added R v TNT [2002] NSWSC 537, to which Buddin J drew attention in his judgment in Raad (at [79]) –
	


“[79] As Adams J has comprehensively examined those cases in some detail, I am relieved from the need to embark upon a similar exercise. As Adams J demonstrates, the researches of counsel have revealed that it is only in very rare instances that an offender has assisted the authorities in the fashion in which the appellant has done. To the list of such cases may be added a further decision to which I referred in R v JSK [2004] NSWSC 470. I there said that:

‘[I]t is common ground that the only decisions which provide any real guidance, given the highly unusual circumstances of the present case, are the decisions of Hidden J in R v TNT [2002] NSWSC 537 and of Sully J in relation to the same offender [2002] NSWSC 394. Although I must of course exercise my own independent sentencing discretion, it is apparent that the decision of Hidden J in particular is useful because the circumstances of that case bear considerable similarities to the present case. That offender was also aged 16 at the time that he participated, with others, in committing the offence of murder. He too pleaded guilty and got the benefit of having provided assistance to the authorities. There was also an additional measure of leniency extended to that offender on account of the considerations identified in R v Ellis. In the upshot Hidden J, after allowing an overall discount of 50%, sentenced that offender to a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. There were as might be expected, features which distinguish the two cases, not the least being that, only a mere week before the murder in respect of which that offender was sentenced by Hidden J, he had killed another person. For that offence, he was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years by Sully J. The sentence which Hidden J imposed was wholly accumulated upon the sentence imposed by Sully J and was undoubtedly affected by considerations of totality. It is to be noted that Sully J also sentenced that offender for an additional offence of unlawful imprisonment. Nor was there any Ellis factor in respect of the sentences imposed by Sully J. Moreover in relation to the homicide offence with which Sully J was concerned, the offender actually fired the fatal shots in what was, as his Honour observed, a gangland execution. It would appear that that offender was under the control of other members of a Vietnamese gang at the time of the commission of each of the offences.’”


	
	The very logic that accepts that sentences should be set to deter crime, by parity of reasoning, is set to deter persons who have committed crimes from voluntarily coming forward and admitting to them. The circumstances, of course, vary enormously. In some cases, the offender will already be a suspect and may think that by coming forward their likely or inevitable conviction and sentence can be significantly discounted. Where, however, the crime itself is not suspected and unlikely in the extreme to be detected, different considerations arise. The only motivation in such a case, as here, appears to be the attempt to assuage serious feelings of guilt. This may be regarded in some sense as an advantage but this does not qualify, to my mind, the essential reality that coming forward involves considerable cost with no countervailing advantage. It was rightly submitted for the appellant that, in a general sense, a person who exposes his own involvement in a crime, especially one so serious as murder, might properly be seen as more deserving of leniency than a person who, for reasons of self-interest discloses the crime of another. The discount, therefore, generally allowed in cases of assistance to the authorities by way of informing on accomplices or other criminals is of no real guide in an Ellis situation except, perhaps, to indicate that the latter discount might well be greater. Persons who are minded to come forward should not be deterred from doing so by the prospect of too lengthy a gaol sentence.
	


Subjective circumstances


	
	I have already referred briefly to the findings of the primary judge in this respect, which are not presently controversial and which, if I may respectfully say so, fairly reflect the evidence.
	
	
	The primary judge observed, as I have mentioned, that the offence was “unlikely to have occurred had it not been for the low intelligence and personality problems suffered by the offender” who was “obviously a vulnerable and suggestible person”. In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1; 205 A Crim R 1 McClellan CJ at CL helpfully, with respect, set out the principles developed in sentencing an offender who is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems (at [177]), reciting a significant number of cases in which the issue has been considered and summarising the principles as follows –
	


“● Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].

● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

● Conversely, it may be that, because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].”


	
	This issue was also discussed in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 245 CLR 120 where the Court restated the principle in somewhat different terms, but to the same effect, as that in the second dot point quoted above. The Court (at [53]) quoting from the judgment of Young CJ in R v Mooney (unreported Victorian Court of Appeal, 21 June 1978) at [5], cited in R v Anderson [1981] VicRp 17; [1981] VR 155 at [160] said –
	


“General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.”


	
	The court went on to say (citations omitted) –
	


“[54] … A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence ... Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.”

Although the appellant’s moral culpability was affected by this consideration and the link between his low intelligence and personal problems with his undertaking the offence, it is not contended on his behalf that he was unaware of the seriousness of the offence he planned to commit – though he thought it was justified by what he had been inveigled all too readily into believing by Ms Shafique – or that of the offence he ultimately committed. That it was, however, an aberration is convincingly demonstrated by his strong, indeed overwhelming, feelings of guilt that (I would accept) drove him to confess. There is no suggestion that his mental condition constitutes a danger of reoffending.


	
	It is not controversial that the appellant was fully remorseful, the prospects for rehabilitation are good and, in light additionally of the somewhat unusual circumstances in which the crime came to be committed, it is most unlikely that he will reoffend.
	


Conclusion


	
	In my view, an appropriate starting point before applying the discounts is a sentence of 20 years imprisonment; to this sentence I would apply an Ellis discount of 60 per cent and a discount for the plea of 20 per cent, in total 80 per cent. This would result in an overall sentence of 4 years. Even taking full account of the substantial public policy considerations arising from the appellant’s having come forward and making a full and frank confession of his involvement in a previously unknown crime, this figure is not only disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence but unreasonably so in the sense of sub-s 23(3) of the Act. Moreover, given the reasons for the Ellis discount, there is also a degree of double counting in the accumulation of the Ellis and guilty plea utilitarian discounts. I would therefore propose that the overall sentence should be reduced to 8 years, resulting from a contraction of the Ellis discount from 60 per cent to 50 per cent and the discount for the plea from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. Applying what might be called the default ratio specified in s 44 of the Act, this would lead (absent special circumstances justifying change) to a non-parole period of 6 years. Since, as it seems to me, this period is the minimum necessary for the appellant to serve in the circumstances and (though minds may reasonably differ as to this) there are no matters of particular significance pointing strongly to the existence of the relevant special circumstances, I would not propose that this non-parole period be further reduced. This explanation satisfies the requirements of sub-s 23(4). It follows that I propose the following orders –
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal upheld.
	
	
	Sentence quashed, in lieu thereof there be substituted a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 12 November 2010 and expiring on 11 November 2016 with an additional term of 2 years commencing 12 November 2016 and expiring on 11 November 2018.
	


Additional remarks


	
	Since writing the above, I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments of Ward JA and Bellew J. Whilst accepting the desirability of reaching unanimity if possible on the setting of the new sentence, given especially the consideration that there is a substantial range within which a sentence may be said to be appropriate, with unfeigned respect, I find myself unable to agree with the sentence their Honours propose. (In this respect, it should be borne in mind that the relevant comparison is that between the discount I propose and that proposed by the majority before applying the s 23(3) considerations.) To my mind it does not, by a considerable margin, reflect the exceptional character of the circumstance in which the appellant came forward and the marked difference between the situation when assistance to authorities is given by someone facing an inevitable term of imprisonment in order to bargain for a reduction and that occurring here where then appellant was not in danger of imprisonment at all and now faces incarceration for a lengthy period.
	
	
	Furthermore, in my respectful view, the allowance made for the plea in effect gives inadequate significance to the unusual circumstances which led to the delay, in particular, because the approach adopted will place pressure on those advising a mentally compromised individual to plead early without obtaining the expert opinion which is essential to enable proper consideration to the appropriate plea. Where obtaining such an opinion is beyond the means of the offender, the unfairness of disregarding the cause of delay is manifest. The public policy underlying the scheme is not adversely affected by recognizing practical realities.
	
	
	Since my conclusion as to the appropriate discount are so far removed from that proposed by the majority, and the sentence I propose cannot be imposed, there is clearly no point in my reconsidering the starting point which, in the nature of things, is susceptible to a greater range of outcomes. Here, however, it appears we differ both as to the level of objective seriousness and the impact of the appellant’s subjective features, especially the significance of the appellant’s problematic mental capacity.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of Adams J. I agree, for the reasons that his Honour has expressed, that ground 2 of the appeal should be upheld.
	
	
	That being the case, it is for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. In exercising that discretion, I have come to a different view than that reached by his Honour as to the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The circumstances surrounding the offending are summarised by Adams J at [13]-[16] and are not in dispute. It is evident that the deceased was killed as a consequence of being struck by the appellant with a hammer. A post mortem examination established that the deceased had suffered two separate skull fractures, and that his hands had been bound with plastic cable ties.
	
	
	The appellant then took a series of steps in an obvious attempt to ensure that he was not identified as the deceased’s killer. They included cleaning the scene of the killing to remove traces of blood, and disposing of the deceased’s wallet, briefcase and mobile telephone. Importantly, the steps taken by the appellant also included travelling to a remote area where he waited until dark before taking the deceased’s body from his van and burying it in the bushland.
	
	
	The appellant’s actions in burying the deceased’s body can only have been undertaken for the purposes of attempting to hide his crime. In my view, those actions are particularly significant and can be taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence: Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126 at [28] per McClellan CJ at CL (Latham and Adams JJ agreeing) citing R v Yeo [2002] NSWSC 315 at [36] per James J; R v Garforth (unreported, New South Wales Court of Appeal, Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ, 23 May 1994); Director of Public Prosecutions v England (1999) 106 A Crim R 99. In my view, those actions of the appellant significantly aggravate his offending: R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170 at [69] per Kirby J.
	
	
	It has been observed that a sentencing court, in determining the level of objective seriousness of an offence, need not (and arguably should not) attempt to quantify the distance between the offence before the court and a putative offence in the middle of the range: PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 at [25]-[26] per McCallum J (Macfarlan JA and Price J agreeing). However, an assessment of the objective seriousness of offending is an obviously essential part of determining the appropriate sentence. As I have noted, it was found on post mortem examination that the deceased sustained two skull fractures. That finding does not sit entirely comfortably with the appellant’s statement to the police that he had struck the deceased “probably about fifteen times”. Irrespective of how many blows were struck, and on any view of it, the appellant’s offending was most serious, constituted as it was by a brutal attack upon the deceased with a hammer with sufficient force to fracture his skull in two places, and ultimately kill him. Were it necessary to do so, I would regard the objective seriousness of the offence as falling marginally below the mid-range.
	


The plea


	
	The circumstances leading to the appellant entering a plea of guilty are comprehensively set out by Adams J commencing at [42]. It is evident that some of the delay leading up to that point was occasioned as a consequence of difficulties in having the appellant medically examined, and obtaining associated reports. Equally, as Adams J has pointed out at [42] (by reference to the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Thomson and Houlton) the primary consideration in determining where, in the range, a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea.
	
	
	In the present case, the plea of guilty was entered two days before the scheduled commencement of the trial. In those circumstances I would allow a discount of 10% to reflect the appellant’s plea of guilty.
	


The appellant’s subjective case


	
	The circumstances relevant to an assessment of the applicant’s subjective case are set out by Adams J commencing at [22] and it is not necessary for me to repeat them. I agree that in view of the medical evidence, questions of general deterrence assume less significance in the present case. Personal deterrence is also of little significance in light of the appellant’s voluntary disclosure of his offending to police.
	
	
	I also accept that the appellant is genuinely remorseful, that his prospects of rehabilitation are good, and that he is unlikely to re-offend.
	


The Ellis discount


	
	Adams J has reviewed (commencing at [49]) a number of authorities in which an Ellis discount has been applied. Because the facts of cases necessarily differ, those authorities are of limited assistance in determining the extent of Ellis discount which should be applied in a given case. In my view, for that reason, there can be no general principle derived from the authorities that an Ellis discount is likely to be greater than the discount applied to reflect other forms of assistance, such as informing on accomplices or other criminals. The level of discount will necessarily depend upon a variety of circumstances.
	
	
	Further, and although voluntary disclosure of offending is to be encouraged, the determination of an appropriate sentence in any case will obviously depend upon the consideration of a range of factors. For that reason I am unable to agree with the observation of Adams J (at [51]) that persons should not be deterred from voluntarily disclosing their offending by the prospect of a custodial sentence which is “too lengthy”. In my respectful view, such an observation has the capacity to convey some expectation that voluntary disclosure of offending will, without more, result in the imposition of a sentence within a low range. In my view, consistent with principle, it needs only to be stated that persons who are minded to voluntarily disclose their offending can proceed in the knowledge that taking that course will entitle them to an element of leniency on sentence: Ellis at 604 per Street CJ. The degree of leniency will necessarily depend upon a number of factors.
	
	
	In the present case, the appellant’s voluntary disclosure was made in circumstances where he was not a suspect in the investigation. The agreed facts make it clear that in the absence of the appellant’s admissions, there was no prospect of the deceased’s murder, or the appellant’s involvement in it, coming to light. Considerable leniency must be extended to the appellant in those circumstances: Ellis at 604 per Street CJ.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having regard to all of the circumstances, I regard an appropriate sentence, before the application of any discount(s), to be 24 years imprisonment.
	
	
	Where, as here, a discount is to be applied to reflect a plea of guilty, the terms of s. 23(3) of the Act must be separately applied with respect to any discount for assistance. However, a sentencing court should be mindful of the combined effect of the two discounts: SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30 at [11]-[12] per Basten JA.
	
	
	The court should also be mindful of the fact that the constraint imposed by s. 23(3) will not generally be met by allowing a combined discount of more than 50%: Z v R [2015] NSWCCA 323 at [33] per McCallum J, Garling J agreeing, Hoeben CJ at CL dissenting but not as to the principle.
	
	
	I have already concluded that the appropriate discount to reflect the appellant’s plea is 10%. The appellant’s assistance in voluntarily disclosing his offending was obviously high. It included leading the police to the location at which the deceased’s body had been buried, so as to allow the deceased’s remains to be exhumed. In these circumstances the assistance was fulsome. Of itself it would, in my view, attract a discount of 50%. The combined discount would therefore be one of 60%.
	
	
	Applying a combined discount of 60% to a sentence of 24 years imprisonment would result in a total sentence (rounded slightly down) of 9½ years imprisonment. There being no proper basis for a finding of special circumstances such a sentence would comprise a non-parole period (rounded down) of 7 years imprisonment, with a balance of term of 2½ years. However in my view, in terms of s. 23(3), such a sentence would be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. This is particularly so having regard to what I consider to be the brutality of the appellant’s attack, and his subsequent conduct in (inter alia) burying the deceased’s body in an attempt to avoid detection.
	
	
	I would therefore propose that a combined discount of 50% be applied. This would result in the imposition of a total term of imprisonment of 12 years, comprising a non-parole period of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years.
	
	
	The matters which are required by s. 23(4)(a) and (c) to be indicated or stated will be apparent from my reasons. For the purposes of s. 23(3)(b), I state that the total sentence I would otherwise have imposed would have been a term of imprisonment of 21 years and 6 months: SL (supra) at [10] per Basten JA citing Horne v R [2014] NSWCCA 133.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Sentence imposed by the primary judge quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 9 years imprisonment commencing on 12 November 2010 and expiring on 11 November 2019, with an additional term of 3 years imprisonment, commencing on 12 November 2019 and expiring on 11 November 2022.

2701654,R v Thompson Kimura and William Rodney Swan (No 1) [2016] NSWSC 568,"Judgment

Background 


	
	The Crown proposes to tender nine photographs of a pair of white football shorts worn by the accused William Swan on 15 April 2013 showing various stains on them. One of the stains was tested and found to be blood. None of the other stains were ever scientifically tested. The Crown Prosecutor also proposes to adduce evidence from the Crime Scene Officer that, in his opinion, the stains that were never tested are also blood.
	
	
	Mr Dennis, who appears for Mr Swan, objects to any evidence being adduced concerning the stains on the shorts that were not scientifically tested. He also objects to the tender of all but one of the nine photographs (namely, photograph 106). The application to exclude the evidence is based on a submission that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant: s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The background to the application to exclude the evidence is as follows.
	
	
	Both accused Thompson Kimura and William Swan have pleaded not guilty to a charge that they did murder Alexander Kormilets (“the deceased”) who was assaulted in his home unit in Redfern in the early hours of 15 April 2013. Both accused are also charged in the alternative that they did rob the deceased of certain property whilst in the company of each other and at the time of the robbery did inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. The deceased did not die until eight months after the assault upon him. One of the live issues in the trial is the question of the whether the assault upon the deceased was an operating and substantial cause of his death.
	
	
	As at 15 April 2013 the deceased resided in the Kendall Building at unit 210/43 Moorehead Road in Redfern. The building is a high-rise building with various CCTV cameras positioned in internal areas of the building, including the lifts.
	
	
	At about 2.01am on 15 April 2013 the deceased telephoned Redfern police to report that two men had entered his unit, assaulted him and robbed him of certain property. CCTV footage shows police arriving at the building in response to this call at 2.05 am.
	
	
	Subsequent examination of the CCTV footage depicts both accused entering the lifts together at 12.28am on 15 April 2013. The two men are next seen at approximately 1.58am quickly exiting the building by the stairs and leaving the building. Mr Swan can be seen carrying what appears to be a white plastic bag at this time. Significantly, in the footage both showing Mr Swan arriving at the building and leaving the building he is seen to be wearing white football shorts with a red and blue stripe down the side.
	
	
	On 16 April 2013 a search warrant was executed at premises in Redfern where Mr Swan had been staying and a number of items were seized including a television later identified to have been stolen from the deceased and a pair of shorts matching the shorts seen to be worn by Mr Swan in the CCTV footage.
	
	
	The shorts were later examined by a Crime Scene Officer Dr Phillip Austin. His evidence before me yesterday on the voir dire was that there were a number of areas of apparent staining on the shorts. He tested one of these areas - the area of staining on the waistband of the shorts. In relation to this stain he performed a HemaTrace® confirmatory test for blood which was positive. A swatch was then taken out of that stain and submitted to Forensic and Scientific Services (FASS). Subsequent analysis of that swatch revealed that it contained a DNA profile matching that of the deceased.
	
	
	Despite the fact that there was more than one area of staining on the shorts, only the one portion on the waistband was scientifically tested for the presence of blood. Nor were any of the other stains ever later subjected to DNA analysis. When asked by the Crown Prosecutor on the voir dire why only one area was tested for blood Dr Austin replied “based on the information I was given. Normally if I am not given any information that there are multiple people bleeding, I will only test one area”: T116.
	
	
	In his opening address last Tuesday Mr Dennis told the jury that Mr Swan admits that the shorts were worn by him on 15 April 2013 and that the DNA profile found on them matched that of the deceased. It is also conceded on behalf of Mr Swan that he is depicted in the CCTV footage entering and leaving the building in the early hours of 15 April 2013. Mr Dennis also told the jury that Mr Swan does not know how the deceased’s DNA got on his shorts but raised the possibility of secondary transference.
	
	
	Mr Dennis’s objection to the evidence of the Crime Scene Officer Dr Austin is twofold. First, he objects to the officer giving evidence that, in his opinion, the red stains that were not tested are blood. Second, he objects to any evidence that there was other staining on the shorts besides that portion that was tested and positively found to be blood being led before the jury.
	
	
	In support of his application Mr Dennis tendered on the voir dire the relevant page from Dr Austin’s statement as well as the nine photos taken by him of the shorts. This became exhibit 1 on the voir dire. Short evidence was called from Dr Austin. No other evidence was before me on the voir dire.
	
	
	I indicated at the time of the objection that before I could make a final ruling concerning the admissibility of the additional staining I would need to know what evidence the Forensic Biologist would give regarding the question of secondary transference as this would have a bearing on the probative value of the evidence in question. On that basis I provisionally ruled that the evidence could not be admitted at that stage of the proceedings.
	
	
	Dr Austin gave evidence until 1pm yesterday about matters other than the staining on the shorts. After the lunch adjournment Ms Mhorag Campbell, Forensic Biologist, was interposed to give evidence. She was cross-examined by Mr Dennis and asked whether a number of hypothetical scenarios concerning secondary transference were possible. The overall effect of her evidence was that all of the scenarios put were possible but she could not comment on the degree of their probability. In response to nearly all scenarios put to her she responded that secondary transference depended on a number of variables such as whether a person’s hands had been recently washed and whether the blood in question was wet or dry.
	
	
	One potential secondary transference scenario suggested to Ms Campbell was whether DNA could travel via the victim’s blood during the assault to one of his assailants then be transferred to a bottle taken by him from the scene then transferred to a person who later picked up that bottle elsewhere and was later found with the victim’s DNA on him. In response to this Ms Campbell stated: “Yes its possible but there again [are] so many variables and steps along the way, I can’t say how likely it is”: T 152
	
	
	Ms Campbell was also asked whether it was possible that if there was blood on the bottles and it was transferred onto a person who later handled one or more of them whether it was possible that there could be no visible blood on the bottles after that person handled them. Ms Campbell replied that it was possible, “…if they put their hands exactly where any blood stains were, and have subsequently wiped off any blood stains…”
	
	
	She was further asked whether it was possible that a person could touch the bottles containing the victim’s blood then touch the waistband of his shorts and then get the victim’s DNA on his pants that way. Ms Campbell replied that it was possible if the blood was wet at every stage of the transference.
	
	
	It was further suggested to Ms Campbell that there could be skin cells on the bottles from their original owner, the victim, which could be transferred to someone who was later given the bottle and the victim’s DNA could be transferred through those skin cells. It was then suggested that blood from a source other than the victim could came to be on the shorts in the place where the victim’s DNA in skin cells was which could mean that the victim’s DNA was from the skin cells rather than blood. Ms Campbell stated that “Anything is possible” but it depended on there being a very large amount of skin cells because DNA from blood is likely to “override or mask or hide” any DNA from the skin cells”: T157 A number of other scenarios were also put to Ms Campbell in cross examination.
	
	
	At the conclusion of Ms Campbell’s evidence yesterday, I heard further submissions from Mr Dennis and the Crown Prosecutor concerning the admissibility of the additional staining on the shorts and the opinion evidence from Dr Austin that, in his view, the staining was blood. During those submissions I inquired as to whether the Crown Prosecutor sought to tender the shorts as well as the photos of them taken at the time. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that she did not propose to tender the actual shorts. Mr Dennis then indicated that if the photos were admitted into evidence then he would seek to tender the actual shorts to show their appearance and in particular the fact that they were dirty. The Crown Prosecutor opposed such a tender and submitted that it would be misleading for the jury to see them as much of the staining has faded since 15 April 2013.
	
	
	I then reserved my decision until today.
	


Consideration


	
	Having considered the matter overnight I propose to allow the Crown Prosecutor to tender all of the photographs of the shorts depicting all of the staining on them and I propose to allow Mr Dennis to tender Mr Swan’s actual shorts. I do not propose to permit the Crown Prosecutor to lead from Dr Austin his opinion evidence that all of the stains are blood. My reasons for making these evidentiary rulings are as follows.
	


Evidence of staining


	
	This is not a case in which there is no basis for the jury to conclude that the other stains on the shorts are also blood given that one of the areas showing a stain on the shorts has tested positive for blood. Had there been no positive testing of any of the areas on the shorts then the probative value of the staining would have been significantly reduced and the risk of unfair prejudice would have been greater. As it is, the photos show a number of small stains on the photos that appear to be similar in colour. One of those stains has been found conclusively to be blood. A swab taken from that staining has been found to contain DNA matching the profile of the deceased.
	
	
	It could not be said that the probative value of the evidence of other staining is low. The Crown case is that the two accused entered the deceased’s premises and assaulted him such that he was seriously injured and bled at the scene. The defence takes no issue that his injuries were life threatening and amounted to grievous bodily harm. Photographs taken of the deceased that night and marked Exhibit B show that the deceased bled a significant amount that night. Photographs tendered through Dr Austin yesterday and marked Exhibit R show areas of staining on the deceased’s clothing and around his unit
	
	
	A significant matter pertinent to the assessment of the probative value of the evidence is the fact that it is anticipated that the case for Mr Swan will be that the blood on the waistband must have got there from secondary transference in one of the ways suggested to Ms Campbell in her evidence. The degree of staining of the shorts is relevant to the question of possible secondary transference.
	
	
	Having determined that the probative value of the evidence is significant I have to consider whether it outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, Mr Swan. If that be the case I must exclude it. The meaning of the words “unfair prejudice” in the context of s 137 of the Evidence Act is well established. The phrase “…means prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way”: Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297 per McHugh J. The question is whether there will be a risk that the jury will misuse the evidence of the staining by undertaking a process of impermissible reasoning.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence called in the trial thus far and to be called I am of the view that it would be open to the jury to infer that the other red staining similar to the red stain on the waistband that was found to be blood was also blood. It is an available inference to be drawn on the Crown case overall. Whether the jury finds that the other staining is blood or not is a matter for them but it would not be an impermissible inference for them to draw on the state of the evidence overall. This would not be a situation where there is a risk of speculation as there will be evidence before them that provides a proper basis to draw the conclusion that the staining is also blood.
	
	
	Mr Dennis suggests that it may be the accused Mr Swan’s blood given that he is seen with a bandage in some of the CCTV footage. That is a matter for evidence and does not go to the question of admissibility of the shorts.
	
	
	Mr Dennis will be able to cross examine Dr Austin to the effect that there is no scientific evidence that the other staining is blood.
	
	
	It will of course be necessary for me to direct the jury as to how they could use the evidence. I propose to explain to them that there is no evidence that the other staining is blood as it was never tested. It will be a matter for them what they make of the evidence of staining but they would be entitled to take into account, inter alia, that one of the stains was found to be blood, the proximity of that staining to the other staining and the appearance of that stain when compared with the other staining.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor indicated to me during submissions that she did not propose to say anything in particular to the jury about the other staining if that material was before the jury. I have presumed that this means that she will leave the legal directions as to how the jury could use this evidence to me as the trial judge.
	


The evidence of Dr Austin’s opinion


	
	On the voir dire Dr Austin gave evidence that in his opinion the red staining that was never scientifically tested is blood.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor indicated during legal argument that she proposed to adduce from Dr Austin that, once one stain on an item is positively found to be blood, the inference to be drawn is that the rest are as well. Mr Dennis submitted in response that any inference drawn by the crime scene officer is irrelevant without “scientific backing.” He likened this evidence to that held to be irrelevant by the High Court in Mundarra Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650 in that the jury can draw that inference as readily as Dr Austin. I agree. Given that I have found that the fact that the other stains are also blood is a permissible inference to be drawn, the evidence of Dr Austin that he has drawn the same inference does not advance matters further.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor relies upon Dr Austin’s extensive experience in identifying bloodstains in order to qualify him as an expert to be able to say that by visual examination and by drawing inferences the stains are blood stains. The fact remains that he did not scientifically test the stained areas. In giving his the opinion that it is blood the witness is hence limited to reliance upon his observations of the staining, albeit based on his extensive experience in doing so. I have also taken into account that, in his evidence on the voir dire, Dr Austin conceded in cross-examination by Mr Dennis that he has been wrong in the past about whether stains were blood.
	
	
	I do not propose to permit Dr Austin to give his evidence that he infers the other staining is blood as well.
	
	
	In the event that I permitted the Crown to tender the photos of the staining, objection was taken by Mr Dennis to the captions on the photographs affixed by Dr Austin describing the various stains as blood. The Crown Prosecutor did not press the tender of the captions.
	


The original shorts


	
	Finally, the Crown Prosecutor objects to the tender of the actual shorts themselves on the basis that the staining has now faded. This means that the jury would be shown shorts that are dissimilar in appearance to that seen by Dr Austin in April 2013.
	
	
	Mr Dennis presses for the tender of the actual shorts. He submits that it is relevant for the jury to see how dirty they are. It is unclear to me, not having seen the shorts and compared them with the photographs, whether they appear dirtier now than they did in April 2013.
	
	
	It seems to me that, in circumstances where I have allowed the tender of the photographs showing all the staining on the shorts as at April 2013, the shorts themselves are also relevant and hence admissible evidence. If necessary I would also permit Dr Austin to give evidence about how dirty the shorts were as at April 2013. I will hear argument on that should that issue arise.

		23 June 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701668,New South Wales Crime Commission v D101 [2016] NSWSC 548,"Judgment


	
	The New South Wales Crime Commission by way of Summons brought an ex parte application for leave pursuant to s 35A(4) of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) to take evidence from a person accused of an offence about that offence. The matter came before me as duty judge on an urgent basis in circumstances where the examination of the person concerned had already been fixed for 12 May 2016.
	
	
	The Summons is supported by an affidavit affirmed by an officer of the Commission on 26 April 2016.
	
	
	The Summons sought an order that the proceedings be heard instanter together with an order that the proceedings be heard in camera.
	
	
	In addition, the Summons sought non-disclosure and non-publication orders pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) in respect of:
	


(a)   The Summons;

(b)   The name of the Defendant;

(c)   The evidence filed in support of the Summons; and

(d)   Any transcript of the Summons.

subject to the requirements of sub-s 35A(8) of the Crime Commission Act and except for:

(e)   the proper execution of the orders of the Court; and

(f)   the proper processes of the New South Wales Crime Commission in pursuing its investigation pursuant to the Crime Commission Act as    disclosed in evidence filed in support of this Summons.


	
	On 28 April 2016 I made a non-disclosure and non-publication order in accordance with s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act  and proceeded to hear the application under s 35A(4) in a closed court on an ex parte basis.
	
	
	At the hearing I accepted as Ms Heard for the Commission proposed, that it was appropriate that the Defendant be identified by a pseudonym. I ordered that the Defendant be referred to as D101.
	
	
	Section 35A of the Crime Commission Act 2012 provides:
	


35A Leave of Supreme Court to take evidence from accused person about the offence

(1)   This section applies to a person who is the subject of a current charge for an offence, and relates to the taking of evidence from the person in relation to the subject matter of the offence.

(2)   The person cannot be:

(a)   questioned under section 24 at a hearing before the Commission, or

(b)   required under section 24 or 29 to produce a document or thing,

in relation to matters relating to the subject matter of the offence without the leave of the Supreme Court.

(3)   Evidence obtained pursuant to leave granted for the purposes of this section cannot be used against the person in any civil or criminal proceeding (other than a proceeding for an offence against this Act or an offence relating to the falsity of evidence given by the witness) or in any disciplinary proceeding, but is not inadmissible as against other persons.

Note. See section 39A (3) and (4) for derivative evidence.


	
	Applications under s 35A have been the subject of three recent judgments being New South Wales Crime Commission v D109 [2015] NSWSC 1244 (McCallum J), New South Wales Crime Commission v D181 [2015] NSWSC 1836 (Hall J) and NSW Crime Commission v D150 [2015] NSWSC 1842 (Adamson J). Those judgments have set out and discussed the background to the enactment of s 35A. I have read those judgments and it is not necessary to repeat the analyses contained in them. However, I gratefully set out and adopt what Hall J said in New South Wales Crime Commission v D181 at [20] as follows:
	


[20]   In an application for a grant of leave under s 35A, in my opinion the following matters arise:

(1)   The supporting affidavit of the authorised officer must establish that he or she holds the requisite state of belief and suspicion referred to in s 35A(4)(a)(i) and (ii) and the grounds for such belief and suspicion are stated in accordance with s 35A(4)(b).  Those requirements, as I have stated, were met in this application.

(2)   In order for the Supreme Court to be “satisfied” of the matters referred to in s 35A(5), the Court is required to assess:

(a)   Firstly, the question of “prejudicial effect” as referred to in s 35A(5).

(b)   Secondly, the question of the “public interest” in the use of the Commission’s powers in order to ensure that a matter therein referred to is “fully investigated”.

(c)   Thirdly, whether the “public interest” referred to in s 35A(5) outweighs any “prejudicial effect” that is likely to arise to the person’s trial from the proposed questioning or requirement.

(3)   In undertaking the assessment referred to in 2(a) and (b) and in making the determination referred to in 2(c) above it is clear that the Court is required to examine and evaluate whether the supporting affidavit establishes the matters to which s 35A refer including, in particular, the “grounds” on which the officer’s stated belief and suspicion are based.

(4)   Given the evident importance of the grounds upon which it is stated that the relevant belief and suspicion are based to the making of a decision by this Court hearing an application for leave under s 35A(5), it is necessary, in my opinion, that the supporting affidavit discloses the existence of facts relevant to the grounds relied upon as supporting the requisite states of mind in the authorised officer (i.e. the belief and suspicion specified in s 35A(4)(b)).


	
	It is not appropriate in this judgment to refer to the detail contained in the affidavit of the Commission’s officer. It is sufficient to note that the affidavit deals with the following matters:
	


(i)   The Commission’s investigation and what it concerns;

(ii)   The Defendant’s involvement in the matters being investigated;

(iii)   The charging of the Defendant with two offences both contrary to Section 307.5(1) (with sections 11.1 and 11.2) of the Criminal Code Act    1995 (Cth) as follows:


	
	aid and abet, counsel and procure the commission of an offence by another person, namely the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely methamphetamine, and
	
	
	aid and abet, counsel and procure the commission of an offence by another person, namely the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA);
	


(iv)   The grounds for the authorised officer’s belief that the questioning of the Defendant and/or requiring him to produce documents or things pursuant to ss 24 and/or 29 of the Act is in the public interest, notwithstanding that the questioning or requirement relates or may relate to the subject matter of the offences;

(v)   The evidence that is relevant to and relied upon as supporting the stated belief as required by s 35A(4)(a)(i);

(vi)   The grounds for the authorised officer’s suspicion that the questioning of the Defendant or a requirement for him to produce documents or    things pursuant to ss 24 and/or 29 of the Act is necessary to investigate the matter fully;

(vii)   The evidence that is relevant to and relied upon as supporting the above stated suspicion in terms of s 35A(4)(a)(ii).


	
	I am satisfied that the supporting affidavit provides evidence relevant to the grounds relied upon by the authorised officer and that those grounds well support the stated belief and suspicion held in terms of s 35A(4)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act.
	
	
	I am satisfied that any prejudicial effect that is likely to arise at the Defendant’s trial in relation to the current charges against him from the proposed questioning or requirement is outweighed by the public interest in using the Commission’s powers to ensure that the matter referred to in the copy of the notice accompanying the Summons issued to the Defendant is fully investigated.
	
	
	I consider, however, that four conditions should be imposed upon the grant of leave to minimise any prejudice to the Defendant.
	
	
	One further matter should be stated. It is not appropriate in the ordinary course, although there may be exceptional cases, for the Commission to appoint a time for the hearing of an examination and then approach the Duty Judge as a matter of urgency to have orders made and reasons provided. Duty judges act under considerable restraints of time because of the amount of both in-court and out-of-court applications. Further, the appointment of an examination prior to leave being granted contains at least a prima facie assumption that leave will be given. Reference was made to this matter by McCallum J in D109 at [1] to [4].
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	


(1)   Leave is granted pursuant to section 35A of the Crime Commission Act 2012 to the Plaintiff, its officers and legal practitioners engaged or employed by it, to question and make full requirements of D101 during a hearing before the Commission pursuant to ss 24 and/or 29 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 in relation to the subject matter of offences he is currently charged with, namely offences contrary to Section 307.5(1) with section 11.1(1) and 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth).

(2)   Order that the Defendant be referred to by the pseudonym D101.

Leave granted under s 35A with the following conditions:

1.   The defendant is to be informed, before he gives evidence to the Commission in the proposed hearing by it, of the provisions of s 45A of the Act and afforded the opportunity to obtain legal advice in respect of those provisions, in particular, his right to object to providing evidence.

2.   The Commission is to maintain a record of all persons to whom the evidence of D101 or a record of any of his evidence has been disclosed, such record to be made available for inspection by D101 upon request by him or by any legal representative instructed by him.

3.   The Commission is to take steps to ensure that the investigators involved in D101's arrest and who are still involved in ongoing inquiries    relevant to his prosecution do not have access to the evidence obtained at the hearing proposed to be conducted by the Commission.

4.   The electronic document library relevant to the hearing process concerning D101 has been and will remain quarantined from the relevant investigating officers involved in inquiries concerning his prosecution and there will be no future communication of any evidence obtained as a result of the hearing by the Commission to such investigating police officers.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
	


Offence and sentence

On 15 June 2012 the applicant was found guilty after trial of the murder of John Garda (the deceased) at Lennox Head on the north coast of New South Wales. The applicant killed the deceased by cutting his throat with a knife.


	
	The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 28 years with a non-parole period of 21 years commencing 26 February 2010 and expiring 25 February 2031, with a balance of term of 7 years expiring 25 February 2038. The maximum penalty for murder, pursuant to s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed pursuant to Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Act).
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to appeal the sentence imposed on him by Harrison J at Sydney on 14 December 2012. The single ground of appeal is expressed as follows:
	


The sentence and the non-parole period were excessive and in error having regard to the trial judge’s conclusions of midrange seriousness, his findings as to subjective circumstances and the applicant’s special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Factual background


	
	The murder of the deceased took place at the applicant's home, which the deceased had visited on the afternoon of 8 February 2010. The deceased was aged 60 at the time of his death. He died at the scene as a result of the wound to his neck. His body was later taken from the premises and buried in a bush grave by the applicant and his brother. The applicant was arrested on 26 February 2010 and has remained in custody since that time.
	
	
	The deceased was a businessman with interests in the Byron Bay area. On the afternoon of 8 February 2010 he went missing. This was not reported to the police until two days later.
	
	
	The applicant lived at that time with his partner, Tanya Barbaro, and their young child in a house owned by him at Lennox Head. The applicant was then aged almost 39 years of age. Ms Barbaro left the family home with their son and checked into accommodation at the Byron at Byron Resort on the night of 8 February 2010.
	
	
	Ms Richardson was a young woman who lived in a flat downstairs at the same address. She rented the premises from the applicant. At approximately 3.30pm on 8 February 2010 while the applicant’s brother was present, Ms Richardson heard raised voices coming from the house upstairs. She heard the offender yelling ""you fucking cunt"" a few times and then a thud like something hitting the floor. She heard screams consistent with a male in pain.
	
	
	At this point the applicant’s brother left her flat and ran up the back stairs of the house and knocked on the door. It was his evidence that when he entered the premises, he saw blood everywhere and eventually saw the deceased lying on the floor. His eyes were open and he was dead. At the time Ms Richardson noticed blood coming through the ceiling of her flat from upstairs.
	
	
	In due course the applicant’s brother was charged with using the deceased’s credit cards and being an accessory after the fact in that he assisted the applicant in the burial of the deceased. He also assisted in cleaning the applicant’s house. On 16 February 2010 the applicant’s brother was arrested and charged with the fraud and larceny offences arising from the taking and use of the credit cards. He agreed to assist the police in proceedings against the applicant.
	
	
	On 26 February 2010 the applicant attended the Lismore Police station and handed investigators a map showing the location of the body of the deceased. The deceased's body was located at the place indicated on the map. An autopsy revealed that a wound to the neck caused his death. The wound was consistent with having been inflicted by a knife using moderate force. There was a wound on the cheek but there were no injuries consistent with a struggle having occurred. There were no defensive wounds on the deceased.
	
	
	At trial the applicant denied that he killed the deceased and said that it was his brother who had done so. By their verdict the jury clearly disbelieved the applicant’s version of events.
	


Proceedings on sentence


	
	Harrison J found that the disposal of the deceased’s body by burial in a remote location constituted a matter of aggravation. In making that finding, his Honour noted that the degree of aggravation was less than would have been the case had there been evidence of mutilation.
	
	
	His Honour noted that the reason for the applicant’s attack on the deceased was never explained. Accordingly, the only finding which his Honour could make was that the death of the deceased appeared to have been the result of a drug transaction which went wrong. His Honour noted that the applicant’s version of what occurred was wholly at odds with the facts that the jury must have found in arriving at its verdict. He also noted that the applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings and in that regard, must be taken as having adhered to the version of events given by him at trial.
	
	
	His Honour found that the offence was not planned, nor was it premeditated. It involved the use of a weapon and there was no provocation. His Honour rejected the proposition that the evidence of a struggle in the house gave rise to some doubt as to the way in which the deceased was killed. His Honour did so on the basis that the medical evidence suggested a right handed assailant cutting the deceased’s throat from left to right at a position behind the deceased. His Honour found that this was done by the applicant who was right handed. His Honour noted that notwithstanding the evidence of a struggle in the house, the body of the deceased showed no signs of injuries consistent with defending some kind of ongoing attack. His Honour also noted that the wound was very severe, being long and deep, and that its infliction required at least moderate force. His Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant cut the deceased’s throat from behind, using a kitchen knife, and that he did so with an intention to kill him.
	
	
	His Honour found that the offence fell into the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.
	
	
	His Honour then reviewed the applicant’s subjective case. Because the applicant did not give evidence, this information was obtained from the history recorded by Mr Borenstein, psychologist, whose report was tendered on behalf of the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant told Mr Borenstein that his parents had separated when he was aged 12 and that his father was a violent alcoholic. He described his childhood as ""pretty tough"". Most of his father’s violence was directed towards the applicant’s brother although he also experienced some of this. The applicant attended between four and five different schools and was described by Mr Borenstein as ""academically challenged"". He was dyslexic, suffered from attention deficit disorder and had difficulty reading and writing. Between the ages of 16 and 17 the applicant had experimented with his sexuality and had been sexually and physically abused by a gay bouncer with whom he had lived for a period of time.
	
	
	The applicant commenced training as a chef at the age of 17. While working at Hamilton Island he met an older woman with whom he maintained a relationship for five years. Eventually they moved to Byron Bay where he opened a restaurant. It was at this time that his partner met someone else. The applicant continued to run the restaurant for about four years. He developed a dependence on alcohol and illicit substances. In particular, he developed a heavy addiction to cocaine.
	
	
	Although the applicant underwent treatment for his cocaine addiction in Austria, he returned to Australia and continued using recreational drugs. He described himself as always having had a problem with alcohol and conceded that he was an alcoholic. He had never undergone any formal psychological counselling or therapy. The applicant told Mr Borenstein about experiencing anxiety, particularly in gaol. He had completed a computer course while in prison and planned to complete his Higher School Certificate. According to Mr Borenstein, the offender did not display any serious symptoms of psychiatric disorder such as psychosis. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance such as delusions or hallucinations. The applicant presented as cognitively intact.
	
	
	His Honour found that the applicant had never accepted any responsibility for the death of the deceased. No submissions were made on his behalf concerning either the existence or extent of any contrition or remorse. His Honour found that the applicant was wholly unremorseful and that he remained in a continuing state of denial about any part played by him in the murder of the deceased.
	
	
	Although his Honour found the use of a weapon to be an aggravating factor, he had already taken this into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending and did not take it into account by way of a further detriment to the applicant.
	
	
	His Honour found the following mitigating factors:
	


The offence was unplanned.

The offence was decidedly out of character.

The applicant had co-operated to a helpful degree with the authorities in terms of pre-trial disclosure.

He had directed the police to the location where the body of the deceased was buried.

He had no criminal record of any particular relevance.


	
	In relation to specific deterrence, his Honour found:
	


“52   I do not consider that the offender will present any assessable or identifiable risk to the community of reoffending upon his release. The very nature of this crime is particularly idiosyncratic. It does not represent or form part of an existing chain or course of criminal conduct. It appears to have occurred spontaneously and reactively to circumstances that remain unexplained. The need for specific deterrence is therefore low. The prospects for rehabilitation are in my view correspondingly high.”


	
	His Honour qualified that finding by observing that the fact that the applicant continued to maintain his innocence was suggestive of a fundamental and continuing lack of insight with respect to the strength of the evidence against him and with respect to the incredible account that he gave at trial of what had occurred when the deceased was killed. In relation to general deterrence, his Honour found that the gratuitous and unexplained nature of the offence warranted general denunciation.
	
	
	In relation to “special circumstances” his Honour found as follows:
	


“55   At the time of his arrest the offender was drinking five to ten schooners, four to five nights a week. Mr Borenstein has referred to recreational drug use and a difficult childhood. There are also some matters of a personal nature and a need for ongoing therapy. This is also the offender's first full time custodial sentence.

56   The offender is currently housed at the Multi Purpose Unit at the Goulburn Correctional Centre where he has been since 21 October 2012. He is classified as remand bed placement. He has been managed with Special Management Area Placement at his own request, which was submitted upon his original reception on 21 February 2010. The offender's current placement is based upon fears he has expressed for his own safety. Details of these fears are scant, beyond a submission from counsel on his behalf that he fears some form of retribution from his brother, whom he attempted to inculpate at the trial, and Mr Kohavi who allegedly supplied the drugs to the deceased, who remains unpaid, and who is therefore allegedly vulnerable himself to others for their loss and potentially disgruntled and correspondingly vengeful.

57   The consequence of his current protected status is that the offender is released from his cell for some hours less than otherwise would be the case if he were free to circulate among the general prison population and his current access to activities is also reduced. This imposes a hardship upon him that means that his imprisonment will be more onerous than if he were not classified in this way.

58   It must be noted that the fears said to have been expressed by the offender for his own safety relate only to his brother, who is due for consideration for release on parole on 15 May 2013, and Mr Kohavi, whose current prison term was not clarified, but which I understand is not extensive. In these circumstances it is difficult to structure a sentence for this offender that effectively accommodates any hardship that he is likely to endure in the short term, having regard to the sentence that I am minded to impose. Clearly enough, the concerns that the offender has expressed do not easily translate, if they translate at all, to a factor attracting variation of the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods. I propose to take account of the fact that the offender will remain restricted and in protection for a short time. However, I do not consider that this is a matter to which I can give any particularly great weight.

59   I find in particular that none of the matters to which I have been referred in this context amounts in my opinion to special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.”


	
	By way of conclusion his Honour set out his findings as follows:
	


“65   I am satisfied, consistently with the jury's verdict, of the following facts beyond reasonable doubt. The deceased attended the offender's home for the purposes of some drug-related transaction, involving the sale or the supply by the deceased to the offender of a quantity of drugs, probably cocaine. In circumstances that remain largely unexplained, a violent disagreement erupted between the two men. The offender ultimately killed the deceased by cutting his throat violently from behind using a large knife. I find that in doing so the offender intended to kill the deceased. The offender's partner Tanya Barbaro had earlier been told to go to a nearby resort in order for her to be absent from the premises when the drug transaction was to take place. The offender's brother and Lily Richardson who were together in the flat downstairs overheard the commotion and what I find was a violent struggle between the offender and the deceased that culminated in his death. Warren Purtill went upstairs and was eventually let into the house by the offender at some time shortly following the death of the deceased. The deceased was then seen by Warren to be lying as described by him on the kitchen floor against an island bench. Neither the offender nor Warren called the police. Warren took charge of disposing of the body of the deceased by wrapping it in his canvas swag and driving with the offender to a nearby bushland setting in his utility where the deceased's body was buried. Warren spent several days cleaning the house and disposing of what remained of the deceased's possessions and his car. The offender left for Queensland and ultimately approached police with information about the location of the deceased's body.”


	
	When imposing sentence and by reference specifically to the standard non-parole period provided for by this offence his Honour said:
	


“67   I have already indicated that I accept that this offence falls to be considered as an offence in the middle range of seriousness for offences of its type. Such a conclusion does not thereby lead to the automatic imposition of the standard non-parole period for murder. All factors in favour of and against the offender have to be considered and included in the process of reasoning that leads to the calculation of what is a proper sentence in this case. I have approached the matter in that way.”

The appeal


	
	The applicant noted that in relation to objective seriousness, his Honour found that the offence was unplanned. He noted that insofar as subjective matters were concerned, his Honour found that the offence was out of character and that the applicant had given considerable and helpful co-operation to the authorities. His Honour found that he had no criminal record, that there was no risk of re-offending, that the crime was idiosyncratic and that the need for specific deterrence was low. The applicant noted that his Honour found that this was his first custodial sentence, that there was a need for ongoing therapy and that there were issues of hardship arising from the way in which his sentence was to be served. The applicant noted that the non-parole period imposed was in excess of the standard non-parole period, even though the sentence complied with s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act in that the non-parole period consisted of 75% of the head sentence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour’s findings of midrange objective seriousness and of the mitigating factors to which reference was made above indicate that the non-parole period imposed gave rise to error. This was because his Honour’s remarks on sentence did not articulate any basis which would adequately support the imposition of a sentence with a non-parole period in excess of the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that the absence of any explanation for why the non-parole period imposed was greater than the standard non-parole period prescribed was indicative of error when one took into account the matters in mitigation which his Honour found.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that because error in his Honour’s approach had been established it was necessary, in accordance with Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; 252 CLR 601, for the applicant to be resentenced.
	
	
	It was not clear from the ground of appeal and the applicant’s written submissions whether his complaint was limited to alleged error because the non-parole period of 21 years was in excess of the standard non-parole period prescribed of 20 years in circumstances where the offence was found to be in the midrange of objective seriousness, or whether, in a way not precisely articulated, his Honour erred in not making a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The position was clarified somewhat in oral submissions. The applicant’s argument relied upon the form of s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) as it was when his Honour imposed sentence. At that time s 54B relevantly provided:
	


“ …

(2)    When determining the sentence for the offence the court is to set the standard non-parole period as a non-parole for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.

(3)   The reasons which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A.

(4)   The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify on the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account …”

Section 54B was amended to its present form in 2013.


	
	By reference to the previous form of s 54B the applicant submitted that his Honour had erred by failing to provide a record of his reasons for imposing a standard non-parole period which was longer than the standard non-parole period.
	


Consideration


	
	When assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour took into account the following:
	


The offence involved the use of a weapon, i.e. a knife.

The wound to the deceased was severe and its infliction required at least moderate force.

The wound was inflicted upon the deceased with an intention to kill.

The applicant’s disposal of the deceased’s body was an aggravating factor.

The applicant was wholly unremorseful.

The gratuitous and unexplained nature of the offence required general denunciation.


	
	His Honour’s approach to objective seriousness was in accordance with the guidance provided by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 in that no subjective matters were taken into account when assessing objective seriousness. Moreover, his Honour did not give to the standard non-parole period determinative significance. Rather his Honour took it into account as a legislative guidepost but also took into account other matters. His Honour made it clear that he was applying the approach set out in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51] whereby the sentencing judge should identify all factors that are relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	His Honour in the exercise of the sentencing discretion was required to take into account competing considerations when engaging in the instinctive synthesis process. What his Honour’s reasoning made clear and what was emphasised in Muldrock v The Queen was that the standard non-parole period does not represent the upper limit for a non-parole period for offences that are found to be in the middle range of seriousness. The middle range is, as the term implies, a range. As Basten JA observed in Ramos v R [2015] NSWCCA 313 at [48]:
	


“…A finding that an offence is in (or outside) the middle of the range of objective seriousness can be of limited assistance and usually involves a high degree of imprecision.”


	
	In Muldrock v The Queen at [28] the High Court said:
	


“Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.”


	
	To the extent that this ground of appeal asserts that a finding that an offence is within the midrange of seriousness automatically requires a commensurate finding that the standard non-parole period should apply or be appropriately adjusted to take into account other factors, is the very error identified in Muldrock v The Queen, i.e. giving to the standard non-parole period determinative significance.
	
	
	The interpretation for which the applicant submitted would have required his Honour to have said something to the effect of “the reason I have departed from the standard non-parole period is …. “. Such an approach would inevitably involved a two-stage process of sentencing and is contrary to the approach to sentencing in Markarian v The Queen. Not only was it not necessary for his Honour to approach the sentencing exercise in that way but such an approach would have given rise to “Muldrock error”. His Honour did comply with s 54B as interpreted in Muldrock v The Queen by identifying the matters which he took into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and by balancing those against the subjective and mitigating factors which his Honour identified.
	
	
	If there were any doubt concerning how his Honour was approaching the standard non-parole period, this was resolved by what his Honour said at [67] of his judgment and which has been set out at [27] hereof. His Honour made it clear that just because a finding is made that an offence falls to be considered as an offence in the midrange of seriousness did not mean that there should be an automatic imposition of the standard non-parole period applicable to that offence. Rather all factors had to be taken into account of which the standard non-parole period is only one, albeit one of some importance.
	
	
	The “special circumstances” identified in the submissions to his Honour were:
	


There was a need for ongoing therapy because of the applicant’s drinking, drug use and difficult childhood.

It was his first custodial sentence.

He is a SMAP prisoner because he has fears for his safety as a result of which his imprisonment will be more onerous.


	
	His Honour was entitled to reject these matters as constituting special circumstances. This involved an exercise of discretion by his Honour. As has been said, an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene” (R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264).
	
	
	In Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, Grove and Sully JJ and Newman AJ agreed) said:
	


“73    One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a “special circumstance”. The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.”

Similar observations were made by Spigelman CJ in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19].


	
	Ultimately, the degree or extent of any adjustment of the “statutory ratio” is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge – R v Cramp at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33]. The presence of circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances does not compel a court to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow at [22]. So wide is this discretion that a finding of special circumstances does not compel a variation in the non-parole period: R v CM [2013] NSWCCA 341 per R A Hulme J at [39].
	
	
	His Honour set out clearly why the matters identified, which provided a basis for a finding of “special circumstances”, did not satisfy him to that effect. Leaving aside the courses which were available to the applicant in prison, the parole period of 7 years was more than adequate for any therapy. It has been held by this Court on a number of occasions that the fact that a person is undergoing his or her first custodial sentence is not of itself a basis for a finding of special circumstances (Langbein v R [2008] NSWCCA 38; 181 A Crim R 378 at [112]; Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12] and Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36]). In relation to the applicant’s status as a SMAP prisoner, his Honour found that this was unlikely to continue much beyond the date when sentence was imposed.
	
	
	Whichever approach to the ground of appeal is relied upon, the ground has not been made out.
	
	
	This ground of appeal was fundamentally misconceived. Accordingly, I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	CAMPBELL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	N ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		06 May 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701672,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Dickson (No.3) [2016] NSWSC 564,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Anthony Dickson seeks an exclusion order under s 94(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) in respect of certain items of property, including a house in Northbridge, two Rolls Royce motor vehicles, a sports yacht and funds in various bank accounts. All references in these reasons to legislative provisions are to the Act unless otherwise stated.
	
	
	On 5 April 2012 McCallum J made restraining orders in respect of certain items of property the subject of Mr Dickson’s application. On 26 April 2012, Beech-Jones J made orders restraining certain bank accounts, which are also the subject of Mr Dickson’s application. The effect of the Act is that if an exclusion order is made the items of property will not be forfeited to the Commonwealth. If no such order is made in respect of an item which has been the subject of a restraining order it will automatically be forfeited to the Commonwealth on 19 May 2016 (this being the date specified in the most recent extension order).
	
	
	On 20 March 2015, Mr Dickson was convicted and sentenced following trial by jury for offences contrary to:
	



	
	s 135.4(5) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (dishonestly causing a loss, or to dishonestly cause a risk of loss, to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing the loss would occur or where there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring); and
	
	
	ss 11.5(1) and 400.3(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (conspiring with Mr Issakidis (the second defendant) to deal with property of a value of $1m or more believing it to be the proceeds of crime).
	



	
	These offences are both “serious offences” within the definition in s 338 of the Act.
	


Relevant legislative provisions


	
	Part 2-3 of the Act provides, in substance, that if a person is convicted of a serious offence, property that is subject to a restraining order relating to the offence is forfeited to the Commonwealth unless the property is excluded from forfeiture.
	
	
	Section 92 relevantly provides that property which has been the subject of a restraining order is forfeited to the Commonwealth within six months of the conviction day, unless an extension order has been made under s 93. Section 93 provides that an order for extension cannot extend beyond 15 months from the start of the conviction day for the relevant conviction.
	
	
	Section 94 relevantly provides:
	


Excluding property from forfeiture under this Part

(1) The court that made a *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must make an order excluding particular property from forfeiture under this Part if:

(a) a person (the applicant) has applied for an order under this section; and

(b) the court is satisfied that the applicant has an *interest in property covered by the restraining order; and

(d) a person has been convicted of a *serious offence to which the restraining order relates; and

(e) the court is satisfied that the applicant’s interest in the property is neither *proceeds of *unlawful activity nor an *instrument of unlawful activity; and

(f) the court is satisfied that the applicant’s interest in the property was lawfully acquired.

. . .

(6) The application must not be heard until the *responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.


	
	Section 180A of the Act provides:
	


Examination orders relating to applications for exclusion from forfeiture

(1)  If an application for an order under section 73 or 94 for an * interest in property to be excluded from forfeiture is made, the court to which the application is made may make an order (an examination order) for the * examination of any person including: 

(a)  a person who has or claims an interest in the property; or 

(b) the spouse or * de facto partner of a person referred to in paragraph (a); 

about the * affairs of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). 

(2)  The * examination order ceases to have effect when: 

(a)  the application is withdrawn; or 

(b)  the court makes a decision on the application.


	
	The applicant for an exclusion order, in this case Mr Dickson, bears the onus of proving the grounds for making the order. The relevant standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: s 317.
	
	
	Chapter 6 defines important concepts in the Act and relevantly provides:
	


329   Meaning of proceeds and instrument

(1) Property is proceeds of an offence if:

(a) it is wholly derived or realised, whether directly or indirectly, from the commission of the offence; or

(b) it is partly derived or realised, whether directly or indirectly, from the commission of the offence;

whether the property is situated within or outside *Australia.

(2) Property is an instrument of an offence if:

(a) the property is used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence; or

(b) the property is intended to be used in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence;

whether the property is situated within or outside *Australia.

(3) Property can be proceeds of an offence or an instrument of an offence even if no person has been convicted of the offence.

(4) Proceeds or an instrument of an *unlawful activity means proceeds or an instrument of the offence constituted by the act or omission that constitutes the unlawful activity.

330 When property becomes, remains and ceases to be proceeds or an instrument

(1) Property becomes *proceeds of an offence if it is:

(a) wholly or partly derived or realised from a disposal or other dealing with proceeds of the offence; or

(b) wholly or partly acquired using proceeds of the offence;

including because of a previous application of this section.

(2) Property becomes an *instrument of an offence if it is:

(a) wholly or partly derived or realised from the disposal or other dealing with an instrument of the offence; or

(b) wholly or partly acquired using an instrument of the offence;

including because of a previous application of this section.

(3) Property remains *proceeds of an offence or an *instrument of an offence even if:

(a) it is credited to an *account; or

(b) it is disposed of or otherwise dealt with.

. . .

(6) Property becomes, remains or ceases to be *proceeds of an *unlawful activity, or an *instrument of an unlawful activity, if the property becomes, remains or ceases to be proceeds of the offence, or an instrument of the offence, constituted by the act or omission that constitutes the unlawful activity.

336   Meaning of derived

A reference to a person having derived proceeds, a benefit, literary proceeds or wealth includes a reference to:

(a)   the person; or

(b)   another person at the request or direction of the first person;

having derived the proceeds, benefit, literary proceeds or wealth directly or indirectly.

336A   Meaning of property or wealth being lawfully acquired

For the purposes of this Act, property or wealth is lawfully acquired only if:

(a)   the property or wealth was lawfully acquired; and

(b)   the consideration given for the property or wealth was lawfully acquired.


	
	Section 338 provides, relevantly:
	


unlawful activity means an act or omission that constitutes:

(a)   an offence against a law of the Commonwealth; or

(b)   an offence against a law of a State or Territory; or

(c)   an offence against a law of a foreign country.


	
	A responsible authority (in this case the Commissioner) seeking to forfeit property pursuant to s 92 must, before the end of the 6-month period following the conviction day, take reasonable steps to give written notice to any person who has or claims, or who the authority reasonably believes may have, an interest in the item of property: s 92A. It has not been suggested that notice was not given to any person who might fall into any of those categories. Section 93(4) requires the responsible authority to give notice to such persons if the Court makes an extension order. The Commissioner has established that such notice was given following the extension orders made by this Court (the most recent of these having been made by consent by Schmidt J on 8 December 2015).
	


The issues for determination


	
	It is common ground that Mr Dickson has established the matters required to be proved in s 94(1)(a) (that he has applied for an exclusion from forfeiture order) and s 94(1)(d) (that he has been convicted of a serious offence to which the restraining order relates). The remaining matters to be proved by him on the balance of probabilities are, in respect of each item of property, that he has an interest in the property (s 94(1)(b)); that it was neither the proceeds of an unlawful activity nor an instrument of unlawful activity (s 94(1)(e)); and that it was lawfully acquired (s 94(1)(f)).
	


The facts


	
	Before addressing the three issues referred to above, by reference to each item of property, I propose to set out a narrative of general facts (which extend beyond any single item of property the subject of the exclusion application) as well as a summary of the evidence of Mr Dickson’s income and that of his former wife, Dagmar Maxianova, the fourth defendant. This narrative will include, where relevant, details of versions given by Mr Dickson at different points of time to explain his situation and the transactions concerning the various items of property.
	
	
	The reason for setting out these matters in this way is that Mr Dickson’s evidence has not been consistent. His credibility is an issue in the proceedings, although he made a substantial concession (which I accept) in his cross-examination which has the result that he cannot prove the matters in s 94(1)(e) and (f), in respect of which he bears the onus, for almost all of the items for which he claims exclusion from forfeiture.
	
	
	On 26 October 2006, a payment of $14.3m was made from an account with the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) to “Neumedix account #1” at the National Australia Bank (NAB) held by Neumedix Health Australia Pty Ltd (NHA). This was the first of several payments from trusts which Mr Dickson referred to as “the ANZ Trusts”. These payments were part of the illegal activity which led to Mr Dickson’s convictions.
	
	
	In February 2010 the Australian Tax Office (ATO) began a tax audit of NHA in which Mr Dickson was heavily involved and in respect of which he answered various questions posed by the ATO.
	
	
	By summons filed on 5 April 2012 the Commissioner commenced these proceedings. The relief claimed included an order that certain property be restrained pursuant to s 18. As referred to above, restraining orders were made on 5 April 2012 and 26 April 2012. Mr Tully became Mr Dickson’s solicitor on the record shortly after service of the summons. Apart from a brief period in 2015 (during which he ceased to act) he has remained the solicitor on the record. His firm was also on the record for Mr Dickson’s criminal trial.
	
	
	On 24 April 2012 the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seized documents from the property in Coolawin Road, Northbridge (the Northbridge Property) pursuant to a warrant.
	
	
	On 30 April 2014 Mr Dickson created a website for Rand Stone Consulting. Prior to that time it had had no website. Rand Stone Consulting is significant because of Mr Dickson’s evidence that he was employed by the firm, which remunerated him by acquiring some items of property for his use and benefit.
	
	
	Mr Dickson was arrested in early May 2012.
	


The criminal trial


	
	On 21 August 2014 Mr Dickson was arraigned on an indictment that contained six counts. Counts 2-5 were alternative counts to the first count.
	


The flow charts tendered in the criminal trial to show the movement of monies


	
	In the course of the criminal trial various charts and explanatory notes were tendered by the Crown as part of the prosecution case against Mr Dickson.
	


The content of the charts and explanatory notes


	
	The first of the charts, entitled “Tracing Transactions 1 and 2”, showed that a total of $18,550,000 was transferred from an account at the ANZ to Neumedix account #1 at the NAB. The first payment, of $14.3m, is shown as having been made on 26 October 2006; the second, of $4.25m, is shown as having been made on 28 February 2007. The balance of the chart showed the movement of these funds to and through various entities and through various bank accounts, the detail of which is not material for present purposes. There are references to accounts in the names of “Dampier” and “Intrepid”. The full corporate names of these entities are not included in the exhibit, but they appear from the evidence relied upon by the Commissioner which will be addressed in more detail below.
	
	
	The explanatory notes to “Tracing Transactions 1 and 2” include the following:
	


“This chart displays the first two payments received by Neumedix from Thistle and Walter Unit Trusts respectively and are referred to as Transactions 1 and 2. The total amount of these two payments was $18,550,000.”


	
	The second of the charts, entitled “Tracing Transactions 3, 4 and 5”, showed the following transfers from an account at the ANZ Bank to Neumedix account #1 at the NAB: $14.3m (made on 29 February 2008); $4.25m (made on 30 June 2008); and $26.615m (made on 28 November 2008). The balance of the chart showed the movement of these funds to and through various entities and through various bank accounts, the detail of which is not material for present purposes.
	
	
	The explanatory notes to “Tracing Transactions 3, 4 and 5” include the following:
	


“2. This chart displays payments 3, 4 and 5 received by Neumedix from Thistle, Walter and Phosco Unit Trusts respectively. The total amount of these three payments was $45,165,000;

3. Figures used for Transactions 3, 4 and 5 are the deposited amounts into Neumedix Account #1- all other figures on the chart reflect the withdrawn amounts from the relevant account unless otherwise stated;”

Mr Dickson’s evidence in his criminal trial


	
	Mr Dickson gave evidence in the criminal trial which he accepted (in his evidence before me) was accurately summarised by Beech-Jones J in the remarks on sentence as follows:
	


“[39] In his evidence the offender told the jury that throughout these events, he was an employee of Rand Stone Private Equity Partnership (“Randstone”). He said that Rand Stone was a consultant to an entity known as the “HFAC Harmony Biotechnology Private Equity Partnership” (“HFAC”), with HFAC standing for ‘Health for All Children.’ The offender said HFAC was a Cayman Islands based private equity partnership that was originally formed between two wealthy entrepreneurs a number of years ago, and that it invests in medical technology (and similar initiatives) designed to improve the health of all children worldwide.

[40] The offender said that his arrangement with HFAC was that he would act as its ‘steward’ for various medical technologies and that Athena acquired intellectual property rights for the three technologies as the undisclosed agent for HFAC. The offender said that the recipient of funds was NHA [NeuMedix Health Australia], Dampier Finance Asia Pacific Ltd, (“Dampier Finance”), was HFAC’s nominated receiving agent for the payments of the amounts owing by NHA under the three assignment agreements with Athena referred to previously, and that the movement of funds from NHA overseas which I will describe were simply NHA meeting its obligation under those agreements.”

The jury’s verdicts


	
	On 22 December 2014 the jury returned verdicts of guilty with respect to the first and sixth counts. Mr Dickson has been incarcerated since that date.
	


The conviction and the remarks on sentence


	
	The order for conviction was made on 20 March 2015 before Beech-Jones J passed sentence. In the remarks on sentence, his Honour outlined the financial transactions that gave rise to the convictions. By reason of s 91 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the findings of fact made by his Honour cannot be used as a basis for a factual finding in these proceedings. Further, a certificate of conviction under s 178 of the Evidence Act does not establish the truth of the facts on which the conviction is based: Steele v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 348 at 378. Accordingly, I can have regard to only those of Beech-Jones J’s findings which Mr Dickson has admitted were correct.
	


Events following the criminal trial


	
	As a result of the order for conviction on 20 March 2015, the automatic forfeiture date, under s 92, was 19 September 2015. On 10 August 2015 Mr Dickson applied for an extension of this date. An extension order was made by consent by McCallum J on 25 August 2015 which had the effect of extending the date to 20 December 2015.
	
	
	On 30 November 2015 Mr Dickson reviewed copies of the documents that had been seized by the AFP. These documents comprised 12,000 pages. He has not relied on any of those documents in support of his application for an exclusion order.

Mr Dickson’s affidavit in support of his application


	
	On 1 December 2015 Mr Dickson swore an affidavit in support of his present application. At that time Mr Tully was his solicitor on the record (having ceased briefly by notice dated June 2015). Mr Dickson relevantly deposed as follows:
	


“[Item 1] This car was substantially funded by the trade-in of another car – Rolls Royce sedan purchased by me several years prior to the payment of any funds from the ANZ Bank trusts. I recall approximately an additional $300,000 was needed to fund the purchase of this car – which was purchased for approximately $1,100,000. So $800,000 was not sourced from ANZ trust distribution money. I recall that the $300,000 was part of my remuneration from my employment contract with Rand Stone Consulting (my full time employer at the time) and I was provided with a “car fringe benefit” under the Australian Fringe Benefits Tax Act regime.

…

[Item 2] This boat was financed by my employer Rand Stone Consulting and was provided to me as a loan fringe benefit under the Fringe Benefit Tax Act Regime.

…

[Item 3] This property was purchased with funds sourced from transactions from an overseas source before August 2006 – the first payment of funds from the ANZ Bank. … Further a loan of $7 million was borrowed from the NAB bank sometime in 2010 or 2011. Clearly $7 million of the value of this asset cannot be sourced from the ANZ Bank trusts.

[Item 4] This property was funded with the $7 million loan from the NAB bank and other funds not traceable to the ANZ Bank trusts.

…

[Items 9a] This property in Northbridge was purchased in February 2005 – 2.5 [sic, 1.5] years before August 2006 ANZ Bank trust first case distributions. This property was funded from non-Australian company (New Zealand Company: Dampier Finance FX Strategies Limited as Mortgagee) with no association to the NeuMedix Health Australasia Pty Ltd (the company that may have claimed false tax deductions following the conspiracy in Count 1 of the Indictment, referred to above) nor ANZ Bank. The property was acquired by Ms Dagmar Maxianova – my ex-wife. The property was purchased with a loan in February 2005 and supported by an unregistered mortgage. A registered mortgage and loan was lodged with the NSW Land Office in relation to this property on 10 May 2010. No funds were ever drawn down or advanced under this loan (supported by the registered mortgage Item 9b).

…

[Item 9b] No funds were drawn down under the loan associated with this mortgage. This mortgage has no value as no money was advanced under the loan associated with the mortgage.

…

[Item 11] This car was funded from the trade-in of a Porsche and prior to that an Aston Martin. The prior two cars were purchased prior to the receipt of ANZ trust funds. The balance of funding was provided by my employer – Rand Stone Consulting (UK based Management Consulting firm).

[Items 13, 14 and 28] I believe that significant amounts of these funds were not sourced from the ANZ Bank trust distributions. There were substantial other sources of funds contributed to these bank accounts – which can be demonstrated from the bank statements of relevant companies.”


	
	On 8 December 2015, Schmidt J made orders by consent extending the automatic forfeiture time to 19 May 2016. Her Honour also ordered that Mr Dickson be examined pursuant to s 180A of the Act and the Court noted that the intention was that the examination would occur on or before 31 March 2016, before the Commissioner was required to file the evidence on which he sought to rely in opposition to the application that certain property be excluded from forfeiture. A direction was also made by consent that required Mr Dickson to serve any further evidence in support of his motion for exclusion from forfeiture by 22 February 2016. Notwithstanding the direction, he did not serve any further evidence (until flow charts were tendered on 2 May 2016, being the first day of the hearing before me).
	
	
	On 18 February 2016, an examination notice was issued to Mr Dickson in accordance with ss 183 and 185(2) of the Act requiring his attendance on 15 April 2016 for examination in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) before Senior Member Lazanas, in her capacity as an approved examiner under the Act. Documents were also required to be produced, including any documents relating to any interest Mr Dickson might have in any of the items of property in respect of which he claimed an exclusion from forfeiture.
	


The examination of Mr Dickson in the AAT on 15 April 2016


	
	Mr Dickson was examined on 15 April 2016 and a transcript was taken, which is in evidence. He did not produce any documents in answer to the notice.
	
	
	In the course of the examination Mr Dickson was asked to name the principals of Rand Stone Consulting. He was unable to identify a single one, although he said (at one stage) that he had worked for the firm from the time he stopped working for Ernst & Young in July 2004 until the time of his arrest in early May 2012. He said that he was employed by the firm and was remunerated on an “incentive plan”. He said that, although he did not receive money per se from Rand Stone Consulting, lines of credit (which he referred to as “fringe benefits”) were made available to him by the firm. He could not recall the limit of the lines of credit. Ultimately, he said Rand Stone Consulting drew down between $2.5m and $3m between 2007 and 2010 and applied the funds as he directed.
	
	
	In his AAT examination, Mr Dickson gave the following evidence about the period after he left Ernst & Young:
	


""Q. Now, Mr Dickson, you left working for Ernst & Young in 2004. Is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember what month you left Ernst & Young?

A. I think it was 30 June. It was about 30 June.

Q. What were the circumstances that led you to leaving Ernst & Young?

A. I had a contract that expired on that date. They wanted to renew the contract, and I wanted to set up NeuMedix and save lives. I wanted a change of career.""


	
	Although Mr Dickson mentioned that he had done work for a mining company, Admiralty Resources NL, he did not mention, at this point of his examination, that Rand Stone Consulting became his employer after he stopped working for Ernst & Young.
	
	
	Mr Dickson was asked the following questions and gave the following answers concerning the Northbridge Property (which are numbered for ease of reference, although the numbering does not appear in the transcript):
	


“1.   What grounds do you rely on to exclude the [Northbridge Property] from forfeiture?---Is that a question that should be dealt with in this examination – the things that I – a legal action I might take in the future? Is that something that I should be examined on?

2.   Can you answer the question, Mr Dickson?---Well, I – I haven’t formalised the grounds on which I will be making that claim in the future. It’s a hypothetical question what legal strategy I will be adopting in the future – I’m undecided.

…

3.   Now, in relation to the Northbridge property, you have said in your answer that you have an interest in that property by reason of the fact that you were married to Ms Maxianova who is the registered owner of the property. Correct?---That is my understanding of at least one of the reasons why I would say that there’s an interest in that property, yes.

4.   And now I am asking you directly to articulate what other basis you rely upon to assert an interest in that property?---I’m not aware of any other grounds at this point in time that I will be raising in that future court case. I cannot tell you with certainty what grounds I will be raising in the future as to what interest I have when that – I’m still formulating my analysis of my interest in that property.

5.   Do you say that you provided any of the funds that went to acquiring the property?---I can’t recall.

6.   You can’t recall whether you say that or not or you can’t recall whether you---?---I can’t recall whether I contributed money to purchase that property.

7.   Do you recollect that $3.3m towards the $4.6m purchase price was paid into Ms Maxianova’s account from one of the Hong Kong companies associated with your brother, John Dickson?---I can’t recall.

…

8.   Mr Dickson, I am going to ask you this question one more time. Did you provide any of the funds that went towards the purchase of the [Northbridge Property]?---And I’ll answer it again one more time. I cannot recall.

9.   You have no recollection if any part of the $4.6m was money that you contributed?---I’ve answered that question. I cannot recall.

10.   What was your understanding---?--- I have no recollection about whether I put money in or – and so forth. I cannot recall.

11.   What was your understanding of where Ms Maxianova obtained the $4.6m to acquire that property?---Plus stamp duty of about another 300, so it was up around the $5m mark. I – I can’t recall the particulars of where – where it came from. I’d like to give you precise answers, but I would like to give you precise – precise answers, so I cannot tell you where it came from. I know it didn’t come from the ANZ transactions that – the subject of my conviction was many years before that, so it came from somewhere else other than that, yes.”


	
	In his examination Mr Dickson said that, after his arrest, his then wife, Ms Maxianova, left Australia with their daughter Natalia, who was born in about 2010. He asserted that he could not recall any details of financial assistance he had given to Ms Maxianova or Natalia. He gave evidence in the examination that he lived in the Northbridge Property until his arrest and that, after Ms Maxianova left to return to Bratislava, his new girlfriend, Monica, moved in. According to Mr Dickson’s evidence in his AAT examination, she continues to reside there.
	


The hearing of Mr Dickson’s application for exclusion from forfeiture

Mr Dickson’s evidence


	
	Mr Dickson bears the onus of establishing the matters in s 94. His evidence comprised: his affidavit; his oral evidence; and the flow charts which had been tendered in the prosecution case in the criminal trial, referred to above.
	


The first mention of the Aslan discretionary trust


	
	When Mr Dickson was called to give evidence, Mr Siafakas, who appeared on his behalf, sought leave to adduce further evidence in chief by amending [50] of his affidavit (set out above, relating to item 9a, the Northbridge Property) to delete the reference to “Dampier Finance FX Strategies Ltd” and substitute “Aslan discretionary trust”. In cross-examination, Mr Dickson agreed that he had not previously mentioned the Aslan discretionary trust, either in his earlier affidavit sworn in August 2015, in his affidavit of 1 December 2015, or in the examination on 15 April 2016 in the AAT.
	
	
	Mr Dickson did not tender any documentary evidence apart from the flow charts referred to below. There were no business records to support any of his assertions. In particular there was not a single document to corroborate his evidence that the Aslan discretionary trust had paid for the Northbridge Property. Indeed, the Commissioner’s evidence, which is addressed in more detail below by reference to each item of property, establishes that the funds for the purchase of the Northbridge Property came from Intrepid Finance International Ltd.
	
	
	Ms Cheeseman SC, who appeared with Mr Conde for the Commissioner, cross-examined Mr Dickson about his failure to refer to the Aslan discretionary trust in his examination in the AAT. Rather than paraphrase his evidence, I propose to set out the following exchange in full since it illustrates the way in which much of Mr Dickson’s evidence was given.
	


Q. Mr Dickson, I'm going to ask you to confine your answers to the questions I'm asking you. As you sit there today, are you able to say to the Court whether you have referred to the Aslan discretionary trust before, in the course of the examination before the senior member, as the party that funded the acquisition of the Northbridge home?

A. Well, I'll have to answer that question clearly and honestly. That day was a blur. I'd hardly got any sleep that night. I'd had an attempted murder made on my life a week before that. I had been put in a cell the night before, at 10pm, with an ice addict, who was on ice, who was going frantic all night. I didn't sleep at all. I got to the examination, and I was completely groggy, and I think anyone that was there saw that. So whether I referred to the Aslan trust or not, discretionary trust, I cannot recall, I'm afraid.

The acquisition of the Northbridge Property


	
	Mr Dickson was cross-examined about the answers given in the course of the examination in the AAT, including those set out above. He confirmed the truthfulness of his answers in [3], [4] and [11] above. As to [5], [6], [8], [9] and [10] above, he said that he had thought about it since and was now confident that he had not provided any funds for the acquisition of the Northbridge Property. As to [7] Mr Dickson said that he did not think that the money ever actually went into Ms Maxianova’s account, but rather “would have been transferred directly into the Mallesons trust account”. Mallesons Stephen Jacques (Mallesons) were the firm of solicitors who acted for Ms Maxianova on the purchase of the Northbridge Property.
	


The ambit of the illegal activity and the veracity of the flow charts


	
	On several occasions in the course of his evidence in the present proceedings Mr Dickson referred to the “flow charts” as setting out relevant dates and transactions. For example in his cross-examination the following exchange occurred:
	


Q. And what's your answer in relation to the first payment being in August 2006, the first cash distributions? It's a phrase you use repeatedly.

A. Yes, it was sometime late in 2006, and if I could look at the flow charts that I agreed with the AFP, I could tell you the precise date.


	
	In the following passage Mr Dickson confirmed the veracity of the flow charts which were ultimately tendered on his behalf:
	


I have the big spreadsheets prepared by the AFP, that I agreed to during my trial, that go through every cash flow that followed from the ANZ trusts. If I could refer to that, I could give you the precise date of every payment to the ANZ trust.


	
	In his cross-examination, Mr Dickson admitted that in 2006 he was engaged in discussions with the ANZ on behalf of NHA which led to arrangements which he described as “inertia funding” through trusts. He agreed that the clients of the ANZ Trust arrangement which involved NHA were Incitec, Bluescope and Gunns. He agreed that the arrangements with the ANZ which he set up through corporate vehicles, including NHA, formed part of the factual context for the criminal charges of which he was convicted.
	


Mr Dickson’s income after 30 June 2004 when he left Ernst & Young


	
	In cross-examination Mr Dickson resiled from the answers set out above which he had given in his examination in the AAT as to the reason he had left Ernst & Young in 2004 (“to set up Neumedix and save lives”). He was reminded of evidence he had given in his AAT examination that he had done some work for a mining company known as Admiralty Resources NL and that he had been unable to recall what his remuneration was.
	
	
	He confirmed the veracity of his affidavit evidence about the source of funds for item 1 (the Rolls Royce phantom) set out above. He disagreed that the best evidence of what income he had received from his employment with Rand Stone Consulting was what he put in his tax returns. He gave evidence that, although he had specifically referred to the “Australian Fringe Benefits Tax Act Regime”, he did not accept that his remuneration would be subject to fringe benefits tax. The following exchange ensued:
	


Q. Why do you refer to it being under the Australian Fringe Benefits Tax Act Regime then?

A. Because it would still be a - an Australian fringe benefit, but it's not - it's not subject to Australian Fringe Benefits Tax. It's the way the rules work. Is it worthwhile mentioning to the Court that I've got a Masters in Law specialising in tax? So I think we can‑‑

Q. Well, you've just done it, Mr Dickson. Excuse me for a minute. Your tax return would identify your employer would it not?

A. My tax return would identify - if it gave rise to Australian source income, yes.


	
	Mr Dickson accepted that he had never identified in his Australian tax returns that he had received a fringe benefit from Rand Stone Consulting for the acquisition of various motor vehicles and a boat in Australia. He also agreed that he had not referred to Rand Stone Consulting in his AAT examination when he was first asked about what he had done when he left Ernst & Young (when he confined his answer to a reference to Admiralty Resources NL). He said in these proceedings that his formal contract did not start with Rand Stone Consulting until June 2005. However he adhered to his evidence in the AAT examination that he had worked at Rand Stone Consulting as soon as he left Ernst & Young (from July 2004) until he was arrested (in May 2012).
	
	
	Mr Dickson confirmed the veracity of his evidence in the AAT examination that he had not been remunerated by any payments when he was working for Rand Stone Consulting but that lines of credit had been made available to him.
	
	
	Towards the end of his cross-examination, Mr Dickson made a substantial concession which affects his application for exclusion of all items apart from items 9a and 9b, as follows:
	


Q. You accept, don't you, that all the items of property in respect of which you bring an exclusion application - except items 9a and 9b, relating to the Northbridge property - were acquired after the first part of that $19 million was received, correct?

A. I acknowledge that they were all funded by the ANZ trusts. Does that help?

Q. Yes. And the ANZ trusts you're referring to are the distributions from the four entities, being the two Incitec, one Gunns and - sorry.

A. Bluescope.

. . .

Q. And . . . that gave rise to an income stream from the tax office here, correct?

A. It gave rise to - cash distributions that gave rise to a taxable income stream, yes.

The tender of the flow charts in the present proceedings


	
	After the conclusion of Mr Dickson’s evidence, the flow charts and explanatory notes were tendered on behalf of Mr Dickson and marked as an exhibit in these proceedings. Mr Siafakas informed me that the bundle:
	


“confirms that a number of the items in question were funded. The sources of funding does come through the ANZ Trust cash distributions.”


	
	Mr Siafakas also confirmed that the purpose of the tender was to provide the Court with further detail of the concession made by Mr Dickson referred to above.
	


The attempted tender of an employment contract between Mr Dickson and Rand Stone Consulting


	
	After the conclusion of Mr Dickson’s evidence, Mr Siafakas sought to tender a document that purported to be a copy of his employment contract with Rand Stone Consulting. I rejected the tender on the basis that it had not previously been disclosed.
	


The Commissioner’s evidence


	
	The Commissioner’s evidence comprised two affidavits to which were exhibited documents. Ms Jessep, a solicitor, who swore an affidavit, was not cross-examined. Mr Lee, a member of the AFP who is an authorised officer under the Act, also swore an affidavit. He was cross-examined, but not to any substantial effect. The Commissioner’s evidence largely comprised documents which, save for the following, will be referred to, where relevant, when particular items of property are addressed below.
	
	
	The Commissioner’s evidence included the tax returns of Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova, which showed the following:

Mr Dickson’s credibility


	
	Mr Dickson was an unimpressive witness. He provided no documentary support for his evidence, which was not only self-serving but also, at times, inconsistent with evidence he had given in his AAT examination. He sought to excuse his lack of recollection as reflected by his affidavit evidence and his answers in the course of the AAT examination by giving detailed descriptions of the conditions of his incarceration. In my view, his apparent lack of recollection was tactical rather than real. The excuse would not, in any event, apply to his affidavit, which was prepared at a time when Mr Tully, whose firm had acted for him for some years, was on the record.
	
	
	Mr Dickson’s failure to recall the name of a single principal of Rand Stone Consulting when he was examined on 15 April 2016 by reason of his fatigue was glaringly improbable, if he had, in fact, worked for that firm for at least seven years. His prevarication about when he started working for Rand Stone Consulting (whether on 1 July 2004 or June 2005) was difficult to follow and suggested that he could not decide which answer would be more beneficial to his interests at any given time.
	
	
	Mr Dickson’s tendency to take semantic points against the cross-examiner demonstrated his facility with language. Nonetheless he was apparently unable (or unwilling) to respond directly to questions put fairly to him.
	
	
	His evidence regarding what he contended to be the correct tax treatment of his remuneration from Rand Stone Consulting was particularly telling. On the one hand he denigrated Ms Cheeseman’s questions about his failure to refer to the benefits as fringe benefits in his Australian tax returns, but, on the other, he was unable to explain in any satisfactory way why he himself had referred to the Australian fringe benefit scheme in his affidavit.
	
	
	Having regard to the directions made about evidence, the preparation and service of his affidavit of 1 December 2015 and his AAT examination on 15 April 2016, I regard the “correction” to [50] of his affidavit in his evidence in chief as a recent invention, designed to obfuscate the provenance of the funds used to purchase of the Northbridge Property. That no mention had previously been made of the Aslan discretionary trust tells strongly against its existence or relevance to the issues to be decided.
	
	
	Mr Dickson’s evidence in the AAT examination that, as at 15 April 2016, he was still “formulating” his interest in the Northbridge Property showed the extent to which he wished to see the lie of the land before committing himself to a version which he considered to be his best option when the time of the hearing arrived. Whereas, in a criminal trial, an accused cannot, in general, be required to disclose his defence in advance, these proceedings are civil proceedings in respect of which Mr Dickson bears the onus of proof. His circumspection about the way in which he was to put his case on the exclusion application indicated that he did not sufficiently appreciate the distinction between his criminal trial (where he had all the protections of an accusatory system, which include the right to silence), and civil proceedings where he, as applicant, bears the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	I regard Mr Dickson’s creation of the website for Rand Stone Consulting on 30 April 2014 as an attempt to give verisimilitude to his references to that firm for the purposes of his then imminent criminal trial (which commenced in August 2014). When Ms Cheeseman put to him that the website was created on the (metaphorical) eve of his criminal trial, he corrected her by insisting that it was not in fact the “eve” (because the criminal trial did not begin until over three months after the creation of the website). His creation of the website was another instance where I gained the impression that Mr Dickson regarded facts as something which he could manipulate for his own purposes, rather than as constituting matters of objective truth.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that I can accept any of Mr Dickson’s evidence except where it is against interest or corroborated. I accept the substantial concession which he made as to the funds for the acquisition of all items of property in respect of which an exclusion from forfeiture is sought (except items 9a and 9b), which falls into the category of statements against interest. I accept his admissions as to the accuracy of the flow charts and the explanatory notes (which were tendered by the prosecutor in his criminal trial).
	


The Assets

Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14 and 28


	
	For completeness I propose to address each item in turn. However, in light of the concession made by Mr Dickson about the source of the funding for all items, except items 9a and 9b, it is largely unnecessary to do so. His concession means that he has not only not proved that any interest he might have in the items of property was neither proceeds of unlawful activity nor the instrument of unlawful activity, but also that he has proved (by his own admission) that the items were proceeds of the unlawful activity. Accordingly, he cannot discharge the onus of proof under s 94(1)(e) and his application for an order excluding those items of property from forfeiture must fail.
	


Item 1: the Rolls Royce AJD1


	
	Mr Dickson is the registered owner of the Rolls Royce AJD1. Accordingly, he has proved that he has an interest in it within s 94(1)(b). It was purchased on 11 December 2008 (which was after the first date on which cash was distributed pursuant to the ANZ Trusts on 26 October 2006).
	
	
	As referred to above, Mr Dickson admitted in cross-examination that item 1 was funded with monies from these trusts.
	
	
	Mr Dickson gave evidence (in his affidavit of 1 December 2015) that the vehicle was “substantially funded” by the trade-in of another car. Although there is a potential inconsistency between these two statements, they can be reconciled on the basis that some of the money for item 1 was obtained through the trade-in of a vehicle and the balance was funded from monies from the ANZ Trusts. For the reasons given above under the heading “Mr Dickson’s credibility” I do not accept Mr Dickson’s affidavit evidence that $300,000 towards the purchase of item 1 was provided by Rand Stone Consulting as a “fringe benefit”.
	
	
	Because of the definitions in the Act it does not matter whether an asset was wholly or partly derived from the proceeds of an unlawful activity. If the asset was acquired using any amount of proceeds of unlawful activity (no matter how small a proportion this contribution comprised), an exclusion order cannot be made. Accordingly, on the basis of his concession, Mr Dickson has failed to establish the matters in s 94(1)(e) or (f).
	


Item 2: Riviera sports yacht


	
	Mr Dickson is the registered owner of the Riviera sports yacht (item 2). Accordingly, he has proved that he has an interest in it within s 94(1)(b). It was purchased on 22 March 2012 (which was after the first date on which cash was distributed pursuant to the ANZ Trusts on 26 October 2006).
	
	
	For the same reasons as given above, I reject his explanation in his affidavit that Rand Stone Consulting funded the purchase as a fringe benefit. As for item 1, the result for item 2 flows from Mr Dickson’s concession. Mr Dickson has failed to establish the matters in s 94(1)(e) or (f).
	


Item 3: Morningside Shopping Centre sale proceeds


	
	On 5 June 2009 Prima Ultima Pty Ltd (Prima Ultima), as trustee for the Prima Ultima Trust, purchased the freehold property to which these sale proceeds relate for $10.35m. At that time, Mr Dickson was the sole director, shareholder and secretary of Prima Ultima. On 1 December 2009 he resigned as director and secretary, at which time Adrian Compton and Michael Harper became directors. Mr Dickson is not a beneficiary under the Prima Ultima Trust. Prima Ultima was deregistered on 21 September 2015. Until that time it was the third defendant in these proceedings. It did not make any application for an exclusion order prior to its deregistration.
	
	
	Mr Dickson has failed to establish that he has any interest in item 3 and therefore has failed to discharge the onus of proof regarding s 94(1)(b). In these circumstances it is not necessary to address the Commissioner’s (effectively unchallenged) evidence about the transfers of money at about the time of the acquisition which led to the purchase.
	
	
	In any event, Mr Dickson’s affidavit evidence as to the acquisition of the shopping centre (set out above) is so vague as to amount to no more than unsubstantiated assertions. His means (as revealed by his tax returns) were patently insufficient to fund the purchase. In any event, because of his general concession referred to above (which I accept), he cannot prove the matters in s 94(1)(e) and (f).
	


Item 4: Interest in Collingwood Drive property


	
	On 3 March 2011 Bristol Wattle Pty Ltd (Bristol Wattle), the eleventh defendant, purchased this property for $9.075m. Michael Harper is its sole director and secretary. NWOD Projects & Advisory Group Pty Limited is its sole shareholder. Bristol Wattle has not applied for an order excluding this property from forfeiture. Mr Dickson has not established an “interest” in the property for the purposes of s 94(1)(b).
	
	
	The means of acquisition of this property is covered by Mr Dickson’s general concession referred to above. In these circumstances, he cannot discharge the onus of proving the matters in s 94(1)(e) and (f). In any event, the purchase price was $9.075m. Mr Dickson referred, in his affidavit, to a loan for $7m, which leaves a substantial shortfall, which I infer was met by funds from the ANZ Trusts.
	


Items 9a and 9b: the Northbridge Property and the registered mortgage

The acquisition of the Northbridge Property in 2005


	
	The Northbridge Property was acquired by Ms Maxianova on 1 March 2005 for $4.6m, pursuant to contracts dated (and presumably exchanged) on 8 February 2005. According to Mr Dickson, the stamp duty was in excess of $300,000 making the total acquisition cost close to $5m. Ms Maxianova’s application for exclusion from forfeiture was dismissed on 2 May 2016 (on the basis that the Commissioner had not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an examination in relation to her application). She is the sole registered proprietor of this property.
	
	
	The documentary evidence tendered on behalf of the Commissioner establishes the following.
	



	
	Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova were married in Bratislava on 10 July 2004.
	
	
	Contracts for the purchase of the Northbridge Property were exchanged on 8 February 2005. Although the purchaser nominated on the front page of the contract (signed by the vendor, Paul Marshall) was originally Ms Maxianova, her typed name was ruled through and initialled and Mr Dickson’s name was written in hand and the change initialled. The solicitors for the purchaser were said to be Mallesons.
	
	
	On 17 February 2005 Mallesons wrote to the Foreign Investment Review Board, relevantly in the following terms:
	


We act for Dagmar Maxianova (“Purchaser”) in respect of her proposed purchase of residential real estate at 4 Coolawin Road, Northbridge in the State of New South Wales (“Property”) from Paul Harrod Marshall (“Vendor”) for a consideration of $4.6 million. You will see that although the contract for sale notes Anthony James Dickson (Dagmar’s husband) as the purchaser, he has the option to nominate another purchaser under the contract, and has nominated Dagmar, his wife, as sole purchaser of the Property. We enclose a notice under section 26A of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (“Act”) together with a completed R3 Form.

Dagmar is a citizen of the Slovak Republic but has a temporary visa (class 820) (“spouse visa”). The visa is current until notification of decision on or withdrawal of, Dagmar’s application for partner (residence) visa.


	
	The documents obtained by the Commissioner from the Foreign Investment Review Board included a copy of a remittance advice which recorded that the sum of $3,322,025.54 had been sent by telegraphic transfer from an account at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd in the name of “Intrepid F I Ltd” [Intrepid Finance International Ltd] to Ms Maxianova on 2 February 2005. I note that the ANZ Trust monies are shown as having passed to this company in the flow charts tendered (although this telegraphic transfer pre-dated the first of such transfers by at least eighteen months).
	



	
	The respective incomes of Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova for the relevant period have been set out above. Their combined income is manifestly inadequate to support a loan of the size of the purchase price; in any event, Mr Dickson conceded that he had not contributed to the acquisition of the Northbridge Property. Although Mr Dickson gave evidence in his affidavit that the purchase was made as a result of a loan secured by an unregistered mortgage, he has not produced any documentation to substantiate any such mortgage. Nor was any such document among the documents seized by the AFP pursuant to the warrant that was executed on 24 April 2012 at the Northbridge Property. The evidence, referred to above, established that some of the funds used to purchase the Northbridge Property came from Intrepid Finance International Ltd. Although it is possible that an unregistered mortgage was granted to Intrepid Finance International Ltd to secure these funds, I would not draw that inference on the balance of probabilities in the absence of documents to support it. I am not satisfied that the Northbridge Property was encumbered by a mortgage until the Registered Mortgage was granted in 2010 (referred to below).
	
	
	Mr Lee’s evidence established that Intrepid Finance International Ltd was a Hong Kong-based company that received funds between about 28 May 2007 and 3 July 2009 amounting to A$67,863,598.40 through the ANZ Trusts depicted on the flow charts. These monies were paid from an account in the name of Dampier Finance Asia Pacific.
	


The basis of Mr Dickson’s claim for an interest in the Northbridge Property


	
	The only identifiable basis for Mr Dickson’s claim to have an interest in the Northbridge Property for the purposes of s 94(1)(b) is that, according to his evidence, there has been no property settlement between Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). I infer from his evidence that he has not made any such application, although they have been separated for some years. For the reasons given below, Mr Dickson has not established that Ms Maxianova has any equity in the Northbridge Property (once the interests of the registered mortgagee and any other unidentified security holder have been taken into account). Accordingly, he has not proved that she has any interest of any value in the Northbridge Property. Since any interest he might have as a spouse, or former spouse, cannot rise higher than Ms Maxianova’s interest, he has not shown that he has any interest in the Northbridge Property. He has not discharged the onus under s 94(1)(b).
	
	
	I note that Mr Dickson admitted that he had not contributed to the purchase price of the Northbridge Property. He therefore has no claim to an interest on the basis of the principles in Baumgartner v Baumgartner (1987) 164 CLR 137.
	
	
	For completeness I propose to address s 94(1)(e) and (f). The Northbridge Property is not covered by the general concession made by Mr Dickson as it was purchased prior to 28 October 2006. Mr Dickson has not discharged his onus of proving that the property was neither proceeds of unlawful activity nor an instrument of unlawful activity. Moreover, the subsequent involvement of Intrepid Finance International Ltd in the unlawful activity associated with Mr Dickson’s convictions is a significant obstruction to proof that the Northbridge Property was lawfully acquired.
	


The Registered Mortgage granted on 21 April 2010 to Dampier Finance FX Strategies Limited

The Registered Mortgage


	
	The Commissioner’s evidence establishes that on 21 April 2010 Ms Maxianova granted a mortgage over the Northbridge Property in favour of Dampier Finance FX Strategies Limited (a New Zealand company) to secure a loan of JP¥353,602,605, equivalent to approximately $4.1m (the Registered Mortgage). The documents were lodged for registration by Mr Dickson. The terms of the Registered Mortgage refer to a “Governing Document”, which is defined as “Loan Agreement – Coolawin Dampier Finance FX Strategies Ltd as Trustee for Dampier Finance FX Strategies Discretionary Trust and Dagmar Maxianova” dated 21 April 2010 (the Loan Agreement). The terms of the Mortgage are otherwise unexceptional.
	


The Loan Agreement secured by the Registered Mortgage


	
	The terms of the Loan Agreement are uncommercial. The date for repayment of the loan is the 20th anniversary of the first drawdown date. Clause 2.6.1 provides that no interest will be chargeable on the Facility until the fifth anniversary of the date of execution. Clause 2.6.2 provides that interest thereafter will be at the rate of 2%.
	


The drawdown notice


	
	The drawdown notice annexed to the Registered Mortgage is addressed to Dampier Finance FX Strategies Ltd as trustee for the Dampier Finance FX Strategies Discretionary Trust. According to the document, Ms Maxianova requested the drawdown of JP¥353,602,605 on 21 April 2010 to “refinance home loan” and indicated that the amount was to be “paid to previous lender”. Although the document appears to be signed by Ms Maxianova, the Commissioner relied on evidence given in the criminal trial by Ms Stegeman, Mr Dickson’s former personal assistant, to the effect that Mr Dickson would often sign his wife’s signature and always used a Mont Blanc fountain pen. She recognised the signature on the document as having been written with such a pen. Although Ms Stegeman purported to witness the signature, it had already been signed when she did so.
	
	
	Mr Dickson did not address this aspect of the Commissioner’s evidence in his own evidence. It was not put to him in cross-examination that he had signed the drawdown notice. Nonetheless, he had been made aware, by the Commissioner’s evidence, that the Commissioner would be submitting that Ms Maxianova did not sign the drawdown notice herself but that he had signed it instead: see Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 16 per Hunt J.
	
	
	I am entitled, pursuant to s 183 of the Evidence Act, to examine documents that are in evidence and draw reasonable inferences from them to the extent to which they are admissible: Ocean Marine Mutual Insurance Association (Europe) OV v Jetopay Pty Ltd [2000] FCR 1463; 120 FCR 146 at 151. The signature on the coversheet of the Registered Mortgage (which purports to be that of Ms Maxianova) is markedly different from that which also purports to be hers on the drawdown notice. I draw the inference that the same person did not sign both documents and that Mr Dickson’s failure to address Ms Stegeman’s evidence gives rise to an inference that such evidence would not have assisted his case: Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418-419, per Handley JA. On the basis of Ms Stegeman’s unchallenged evidence, I infer that Mr Dickson probably signed the drawdown notice in the name of Ms Maxianova.
	
	
	I note that no application for exclusion has been brought by the registered mortgagee of the Northbridge Property (which is the twelfth defendant in these proceedings).
	


Whether funds were in fact drawn down under the Registered Mortgage


	
	Mr Dickson’s evidence was that, although the Registered Mortgage was lodged on the title to the Northbridge Property on 10 May 2010, no funds were ever drawn down on the loan. His evidence is inconsistent with the documents referred to above. Nonetheless, for the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that his evidence that no funds were ever drawn down on the loan ought be accepted.
	
	
	The timing of the grant of the Registered Mortgage is significant for the purposes of s 94(1)(e) and, in particular, to determine whether the Northbridge Property is an instrument of unlawful activity. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, of the following:
	



	
	Intrepid Finance International Ltd had (by April 2010) received substantial funds as a result of unlawful activity through the ANZ Trusts;
	
	
	the purpose of the Registered Mortgage was to create the impression (contrary to the fact) that money was actually paid to Intrepid Finance International Ltd to refinance a real mortgage;
	
	
	it was in Mr Dickson’s interests to have the ATO, which was at the time conducting an audit into NHA, believe that there was a lawful basis for some of the monies held by Intrepid Finance International Ltd;
	
	
	in reality, no such money was paid to Intrepid Finance International Ltd; and
	
	
	when he signed the drawdown notice (as Ms Maxianova) and personally lodged the Registered Mortgage, Mr Dickson intended to make use of Ms Maxianova’s registered ownership of the Northbridge Property in, or in connection with, the commission of an offence.
	



	
	On this basis I am satisfied that the Northbridge Property and the Registered Mortgage were probably instruments of an offence within the meaning of s 329(2).
	


Conclusion


	
	Mr Dickson’s claim for an exclusion from forfeiture of items 9a and 9b fails as he has not proved the matters in respect of which he bears the onus in s 94(1)(b), (e) or (f).
	


Item 11: Rolls Royce AJD2


	
	The Rolls Royce AJD2 was acquired on 21 March 2011 and is registered in the name of the seventh defendant, Sydney City Prestige Wholesale Pty Limited (which has not applied for exclusion). Mr Dickson has not established that he has any interest in the property under s 94(1)(b).
	
	
	As item 11 was purchased after 28 October 2006, it is covered by Mr Dickson’s concession that it was acquired with funds from the ANZ Trusts. Although Mr Dickson’s affidavit evidence was that some of the funds for the purchase of the vehicle were provided by the trade-in of a Porsche and an Aston Martin which had been purchased before 26 October 2006, this is reconcilable with his concession. For the reasons given above, he cannot prove the matters in s 94(1)(e) and (f) if any contribution to the acquisition of the asset was made by proceeds of an unlawful activity. Mr Dickson also gave evidence that this vehicle was paid for by Rand Stone Consulting. For the reasons given above, I do not accept this evidence.
	
	
	Mr Dickson’s claim for exclusion in respect of item 11 must fail as he has failed to prove any of the matters in s 94(1)(b), (e) and (f).
	


Items 13, 14 and 28: New Zealand and UAE bank accounts in (or formerly in) the names of Dampier Finance FX Solutions Limited, Meed Incorporated, Esprit de Corps Incorporated and Dampier Finance Group Limited


	
	No application for exclusion is brought by, or on behalf of, Dampier Finance FX Solutions Limited, Meed Incorporated, Esprit de Corps Incorporated or Dampier Finance Group Limited. Mr Dickson has failed to prove that he has any interest in these items as required by s 94(1)(b).
	
	
	These items are covered by Mr Dickson’s general concession that all property apart from items 9a and 9b were funded with monies from the ANZ Trusts. Accordingly, Mr Dickson cannot prove the matters in s 94(1)(e) or (f).
	
	
	In any event, even if Mr Dickson’s affidavit evidence that “significant amounts of these funds were not sourced from the ANZ Bank trust distributions”, and that there were “substantial other sources of funds contributed to these bank accounts”, is accepted, this does not assist his application for exclusion. As long as some of the funds from the ANZ Trusts went into these accounts, the application for exclusion must fail as Mr Dickson cannot prove the matters in s 94(1)(e) and (f).
	


Conclusion


	
	Mr Dickson has failed to make out his claim for exclusion in respect of any of the items identified.
	


Orders


	
	I made the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the first defendant’s notice of motion for exclusion of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 9a, 9b, 11, 13, 14 and 28 from forfeiture under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).
	
	
	Order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701673,Swan v R [2016] NSWCCA 79,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Garling J that it was not open to the jury in all the circumstances of this case to find beyond reasonable doubt that the injury sustained by the victim amounted to grievous bodily harm. Subject to what follows I agree with his Honour's reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	Garling J has also considered a question whether the characterisation of an injury as ""grievous bodily harm"" can involve considerations going beyond the effects of the injury. For my part I do not see the resolution of that question as necessary for the disposition of this case and so I refrain from expressing any view.
	
	
	I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J.
	
	
	GARLING J: From 10 June 2014 to 17 June 2014, the appellant, Dean Matthew Swan, stood trial in the District Court at Newcastle on an Indictment containing three counts.
	
	
	On 17 June 2014, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of the first two counts on the Indictment. As the third count was an alternative to the second count, no jury verdict on that count was necessary or taken.
	
	
	The first count on the Indictment was that the appellant, on 12 February 2013, at Cessnock, did engage in conduct in the nature of an affray contrary to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The jury found the appellant guilty. No appeal is brought against this finding by the jury, nor the entry of conviction consequent upon the jury’s verdict.
	
	
	The second count on the Indictment was that the appellant:
	


“On 12 February 2013 at Cessnock in the State of New South Wales, in company did cause grievous bodily harm to Jason Dewey and [was] reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to him.”


	
	This was an offence contrary to s 35(1) of the Crimes Act. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on this count.
	
	
	The third, and alternative, count on the Indictment upon which no verdict was taken was that the appellant assaulted Jason Dewey thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The appellant stood trial with a co-accused, Ryan Hodge. Mr Hodge was found not guilty of the offences with which he was charged. As a consequence, he has no role in this appeal.
	
	
	On 4 November 2014, Berman SC DCJ imposed the following sentences upon the appellant:
	



	
	for the offence of affray, a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 14 June 2014 and expiring on 13 June 2016, and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months; and
	
	
	for the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm in company, a term of imprisonment of 3 years, comprising a non‑parole period of 1 year and 6 months commencing 14 March 2015 and expiring on 13 September 2016, and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.
	



	
	The effective overall sentence was a period of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 14 June 2014 and expiring on 13 September 2016.
	


Notice of Appeal


	
	On 16 November 2015, the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal. It contained a single ground, namely:
	


“The verdict in respect of Count 2 is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.”


	
	The appellant does not appeal against the verdict in respect of Count 1, nor has he sought leave to appeal against either of the sentences imposed by Berman DCJ.
	
	
	As this single ground does not raise only a question of law, leave to appeal is required: s 5(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Since, as is apparent later, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, I have, and will, refer to the applicant as the appellant.
	


Applicable Legal Test


	
	The principles to be applied by this Court in determining this appeal are not in doubt: see M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400.
	
	
	I commence with an acknowledgement that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining the guilt of an accused and that, in discharging that responsibility, the jury has the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. Nevertheless, on an appeal against a jury verdict, this Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. In so doing, the Court is to consider whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. As Hayne J observed in Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113], the question is “whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt”.
	
	
	The task for this Court is not to determine whether there was evidence to support the jury’s verdict as a matter of law. Rather, the task for this court is to determine, on its own assessment of the evidence, whether it entertains a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. Ordinarily, a reasonable doubt entertained by this Court would be a doubt which a jury ought to have entertained. However, this conclusion may not follow in cases where the jury was capable of resolving the doubt by virtue of its advantage of being able to see and hear the evidence.
	
	
	I respectfully agree with the way in which the Court’s task was expressed by Bathurst CJ (with whom Price J agreed) in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [308]:
	


“It is not enough for the verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows that it was open to the jury to reach a different conclusion. That was made clear by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113]. However, it is equally clear that it is not sufficient that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. That was made clear in M, cited in SKA at [13]. If, after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury as the fact finder, the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving that doubt, that the court can conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 (MFA) at [26] and [55]-[56]).”

Appellant’s Submissions


	
	The appellant submits that, having regard to all of the evidence led by the Crown, this Court must entertain a reasonable doubt that the victim, Mr Dewey, suffered grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	As the appellant submits, the Crown has the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offence on Count 2 of the Indictment. One of the elements of that offence is that the victim suffered an injury which amounted to grievous bodily harm. The appellant submits that the Crown did not discharge its onus with respect to that element and, accordingly, the verdict on Count 2 is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	The appellant accepts that if his conviction on Count 2 is quashed, then the Court ought to proceed by way of substitution of a verdict of guilty for the alternative offence on Count 3 of the Indictment, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company: s 7(2) Criminal Appeal Act. The appellant accepts that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of this offence. The appellant submits that the Court should proceed to sentence him with respect to that less serious offence and, accordingly, should impose a less severe sentence.
	


The Offence


	
	The facts surrounding the offence the subject of this appeal can briefly be summarised as follows
	
	
	On 12 February 2013, Mr Dewey, the victim, was at a house in Cessnock at which his wife and their two children, a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl, lived. Mr Dewey lived next door to that house with his mother, but was a regular visitor at his wife’s house.
	
	
	Late on the evening of 12 February 2013, at a time when his children were asleep, and his wife was in bed, the victim (who was still awake) heard voices coming from a number of men outside the house. They were threatening the victim. The victim went out to the front veranda where he saw a group of approximately 10 men at the front of the house. He observed that some of them were armed with bats or pieces of wood. One of the men yelled out to the victim that they were going to kill him.
	
	
	The victim recognised the appellant in the group, who was his wife’s cousin. He knew him well because they had lived together for approximately a year. The victim’s wife, who came out onto the front veranda, recognised a number of other men in the group.
	
	
	The victim’s wife took their son to the house next door where the victim’s mother lived. From there she telephoned the police. The victim attempted to escort his daughter away from the house, which had been damaged by a number of the men. As he did so, members of the group struck him with implements and threw objects at him, including rocks and bricks. Eventually, the victim’s daughter ran next door to her mother.
	
	
	After his daughter had left his care, the victim was grabbed and forcibly dragged to the middle of the front yard of the house. Members of the group surrounded him while he was on the ground, and he was kicked and punched. He was struck with a cricket bat. A guitar was smashed over his head. He was punched on the side of the face. He was kicked and punched whilst lying in a foetal position on the ground.
	
	
	One of the members of the group called out “Get in here Dean and have a go; we’re here for you”. At that time, the appellant, who had been standing back from the group, ran in and kicked the victim several times before retreating. Police car sirens were heard approaching and the group fled.
	


The Crown Case


	
	It was the Crown case at trial that the victim had sustained grievous bodily harm by reason of a fracture to the transverse process of the L3 vertebra. The victim also sustained a laceration to the forehead, a laceration to the back of the neck, bruising to the left side of the back, grazing and bruising to the left forearm, grazing to the right elbow and grazing to the knees. These other injuries were not relied upon by the Crown as amounting to grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	An ambulance attended and the victim was taken to hospital, where he remained for 48 hours.
	
	
	In the Crown case, the injuries sustained by the victim, and the consequences of them, were only addressed by two witnesses: the victim himself and Dr Ting. It is appropriate to now note their evidence.
	


Evidence of Mr Dewey


	
	Mr Dewey said that after the affray and the assault upon him, he walked into his wife’s house and grabbed a drink of water. He noticed some damage which had occurred inside the house and attempted to fix it. Having done so, he walked out to the front of the house and went to sit on the front veranda. He was unable to sit down because his back was aching “too hard”. He was assisted by a police officer to sit on the gutter.
	
	
	He described the pain at that time as being in the lower left side of his back. He said that it was excruciating. He said that he was unable to walk properly for two or three days, and then when he could finally walk, it was a struggle. He was asked how long it was that he struggled to walk and he responded by saying that he was in pain for “ages”. When asked to describe how long that was, he said it was for “a good few weeks”.
	
	
	Mr Dewey went on to say:
	


“[I] [s]till suffer from it a little bit now, but you know, touch wood, it hasn’t been too bad.”


	
	He said that he continued to experience pain when he picks up a bag of cement or when he piggybacks the kids around the house.
	
	
	Mr Dewey informed the Court that he did not require surgery and that he had some other minor injuries by way of lacerations, bruising and grazes on various parts of his body.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Dewey told counsel for the appellant that he did not remember the trip in the ambulance because “I was that doped off my head on morphine, mate”. There was no cross-examination which took issue with any of Mr Dewey’s evidence about the extent of his injuries or the consequences of them.
	


Evidence of Dr Ting


	
	Dr Ting gave evidence by telephone. This occurred as a result of an agreement between the Crown, the appellant and his co-accused. She gave evidence that she had treated Mr Dewey on the evening that he was brought in by ambulance to the John Hunter Hospital. She described various lacerations, abrasions and bruising. She then added that Mr Dewey was “quite sore in the mid-line of his back from … below his chest to his tailbone”.
	
	
	Dr Ting said that Mr Dewey had been sent for a CT scan because of the laceration on his forehead. The CT scan was undertaken so as to confirm that Mr Dewey had not suffered any brain damage.
	
	
	She said that the CT scan detected a transverse process fracture on the left side at L3. She described that fracture as follows:
	


“A transverse process is a part of the backbone [which] is made of many individual units. The lumbar spine spans the area from the bottom of your chest to your tailbone and that’s individually – there’s five of them. It’s labelled L1 to L5. He’s injured the one in the middle, which is – if you look at an x-ray, it’s the second from the bottom and it’s the little side – the bony protrusion from the side of his vertebral that he’s fractured on the left side. It’s a part of a backbone unit.”


	
	Dr Ting said that the injury did not traverse the victim’s spinal canal, but that it could have been “quite sore” at the time it was sustained.
	
	
	Dr Ting said by reference to the hospital records that Mr Dewey complained of being sore in the area of his left lower back upon admission, and also on the following morning.
	
	
	She said that a neurosurgeon consulted with Mr Dewey on the morning after his admission, and was satisfied that the fracture was stable. A back brace was not needed, and Mr Dewey was advised that he could go home once he could “mobilise”.
	
	
	She said that there was no need for any follow up of Mr Dewey by any medical practitioner with respect to his back injury. She also said that no other treatment was necessary for his back.
	
	
	She was asked about the effect that the injury would have on Mr Dewey and said:
	


“He would be out of work – sorry, he would not be able to do any physical work for the greater part of four to six weeks while the fracture is healing, primarily because of pain, but he should have no long term consequence.”


	
	She was asked to describe what was meant by the description of the fracture as “stable”, and she gave this evidence:
	


“It means that the fracture did not go into the part of the vertebra that contained the spinal cord, and that the muscles around the area held the fragment in place so it was not likely to go anywhere. So there was no intervention that was needed and was unlikely to cause him any neurological deficit long term or any immediate bleeding.”


	
	She was asked to describe the seriousness of the injury, and she said “Considering the circumstances, it’s very minor”.
	
	
	In cross-examination, she agreed with counsel for the appellant that the L3 vertebra was embedded within its own muscle and that, on its posterior side, that is, its back, it was surrounded by thick fat. She said that, on the front of the vertebra, there was “just a lot of muscle”.
	
	
	Dr Ting agreed with counsel for the appellant that Mr Dewey’s fractured transverse process would not be a permanent injury, and that there was nothing which would suggest that Mr Dewey would not make a full recovery from the injury. She was then asked this question, and gave this answer:
	


“Q.   Considering all the types of transverse process fractures that are possible, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the least serious and 10 being the most serious, where would you put Jason Dewey’s fractured transverse process?

A.   3.”


	
	She went on to give this evidence:
	


“Q.   You said the time that you authored the report, that you were of the opinion that the injuries were minor?

A.   That is correct.

Q.   Do you stand by that opinion?

A.   I do.

Q.   You also went on to say that the prognosis was considered to be good?

A.   Yes.

Q.   With short term disability anticipated?

A.   Correct.

Q.   When you say short term disability, by that do you mean that you anticipate in the medium and long term, a full recovery or no disability?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And what sort of short term disability did you have in mind if you’re able to say so?

A.   The lower back pain from a transverse process fracture or any fracture, is going to take about six weeks to three months to heal. So Mr Dewey, from memory, does a lot of physical labour so that would impact his lifestyle in the short term, in terms of going back to work.

Q.   Mr Dewey walked out of hospital when he was discharged didn’t he?

A.   Yes he did.”

Other Evidence


	
	As well as the evidence from Mr Dewey and Dr Ting, the jury saw seven photographs of the victim taken on the night of the affray and before the victim was taken to hospital. A number of the photographs show the bruising on the victim’s back. The victim’s CT scan, which was relied upon at the hospital to diagnose the bony fracture, was not tendered to the jury.
	
	
	By its nature, the transverse process fracture was not visible in the photographs taken of the victim at that time.
	


“Grievous Bodily Harm”


	
	Section 4 of the Crimes Act provides an inclusive definition of the term “grievous bodily harm”:
	


4 Definitions 

…

""Grievous bodily harm"" includes:


	
	the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm, and
	
	
	any permanent or serious disfiguring of the person, and
	
	
	any grievous bodily disease (in which case a reference to the infliction of grievous bodily harm includes a reference to causing a person to contract a grievous bodily disease).
	


None of those included definitions apply to the circumstances in this appeal.


	
	The offences charged in the alternative on the Indictment involve the concepts of “grievous bodily harm” and “actual bodily harm”. These are offences of different levels of seriousness, reflected in their significantly different maximum terms of imprisonment.
	
	
	“Actual bodily harm” means any hurt or injury that interferes with the health or comfort of a person. Such an injury does not need to be permanent, but it must have more than a fleeting or trivial effect upon the victim. As the trial Judge directed the jury in this case, bruising may constitute actual bodily harm. There was no dispute at trial that the injuries sustained by the victim, Mr Dewey, constituted actual bodily harm.
	
	
	“Grievous bodily harm” refers to a more serious form of injury than actual bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm means really serious bodily injury. In R v Perks (1986) 41 SASR 335, King CJ noted that, in attempting to explain the phrase “grievous bodily harm” to a jury, a trial Judge should not use merely the word “serious”, but the words “really serious”.
	
	
	The phrase “really serious bodily injury” has its genesis in the English courts. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith [1961] AC 290, the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Kilmuir said at 334:
	


“I can find no warrant for giving the words ‘grievous bodily harm’ a meaning other than that which the words convey in their ordinary and natural meaning. ‘Bodily harm’ needs no explanation, and ‘grievous’ means no more and no less than ‘really serious’.”

The Lord Chancellor expressed his agreement with the judgment of Martin J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Miller [1951] VLR 346 at 307.


	
	In Miller, Martin J (with whom Smith J and Coppel AJ agreed) held that it was an error for the trial Judge to have directed the jury that grievous bodily harm meant “some serious interference with bodily health or comfort”. At 356, Martin J said:
	


“A black eye, or a sprain or any considerable bruising will quite commonly amount to a serious interference with bodily comfort, and the same is true of the normal results of an ordinary caning of a schoolboy. But such matters cannot be brought within the ordinary and natural meaning of the expression ‘grievous bodily harm’.”


	
	At 358, his Honour reiterated that the words “grievous bodily harm” were to be considered by reference to their natural and ordinary meaning.
	
	
	The Lord Chancellor’s description of “grievous bodily harm” as “really serious bodily injury” in Smith was embraced by Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Diplock in their speeches in Hyam v DPP [1974] UKHL 2; [1975] AC 55.
	
	
	In one sense, describing “grievous bodily harm” as “really serious bodily injury” does little to elucidate the meaning of the phrase. However, the addition of the word “really” to the phrase “serious injury” does indicate that the phrase refers to injuries which are considerably more serious than those which constitute “actual bodily harm”.
	
	
	In Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209, Johnson J observed at [162] that there is no bright-line test for determining whether a particular injury or injuries constitute grievous bodily harm, a remark with which McCallum J agreed at [168]. His Honour also approved the direction given in that case to the jury that the words “grievous bodily harm”:
	


“… do not require that the injuries are a permanent one nor that the consequences of the injury are long-lasting or life threatening, but that they do require that the injury is a really serious one.” (sic)


	
	In AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203, Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and I agreed), said at [70]:
	


“At common law, the words ‘grievous bodily harm’ are given their ordinary natural meaning. ‘Bodily harm’ needs no explanation and ‘grievous’ simply means ‘really serious’: R v Overall (1993) 71 A Crim R 170 at 173; Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209 …”


	
	It is clear from the authorities that in ascertaining what constitutes really serious bodily injury, questions of fact and degree are involved. In R v Overall (1993) 71 A Crim R 170, Mahoney JA (with whom Allen J agreed) considered the difference between actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. At 174, his Honour said:
	


“The difference between actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm is … one of degree. Actual bodily harm if ‘really serious’ (cf DPP v Smith at 335; 291) may constitute grievous bodily harm. Each is ‘harm’ but the one is more serious than the other.”


	
	A remaining question, upon which no direct authority was cited by the parties, is whether the characterisation of an injury as “grievous bodily harm” can involve considerations going beyond the effects of the injury. That is, in assessing whether an injury amounts to “grievous bodily harm”, is it open to a jury to have regard to the personal, social and economic consequences of the injury, in addition to the physical effects of the injury? For example, an injury such as a black eye may have very different consequences for an individual depending on their occupation. It may have little, if any, financial consequence by way of time off from work for a person engaged in an ordinary occupation. However, if the victim was a fashion model who could not take part in photographic shoots or fashion shows for a period of time until the physical consequences of the injury had completely disappeared, there might be very significant financial consequences from an injury ordinarily regarded as actual, and not grievous, bodily harm. Do such consequences convert the injury into grievous bodily harm in that hypothetical and individual case?
	
	
	If a person employed in an administrative position suffers a fracture of their little finger in an assault, they might have little, if any, time away from work and few, if any, ongoing consequences. However if the fracture was sustained by a concert pianist, severe financial consequences to that pianist’s career might ensue. Does an injury which comprises actual bodily harm such as bruising to an individual’s non-dominant hand become grievous bodily harm if the same injury is sustained to the individual’s dominant hand, thereby significantly impacting on their capacity to carry out their work, or do many tasks of individual care which require use of the dominant hand? One could think of many other similar examples.
	
	
	In another respect, should the natural stoicism of a victim, who tolerates high levels of pain consequent upon an injury, mean that that the injury falls below the level of being “really serious”? Conversely, should the heightened sensitivity of another victim, who reports extreme levels of pain consequent upon an injury, mean that the injury is “really serious”?
	
	
	By the definition in s 4 of the Crimes Act, grievous bodily harm includes “any permanent or serious disfigurement of a person”. In addition to its physical consequences, the “seriousness” of a disfigurement might be seen to depend on other matters such as the victim’s age, the status of a personal relationship, cultural influences and the reactions of other people to the sight of the disfigured individual. A victim with narcissistic traits might react to such an injury, even if minor, quite differently from someone who does not have such a disposition.
	
	
	All of these examples lead me to conclude that in determining whether an injury constitutes grievous bodily harm, within that expression’s ordinary and natural meaning, such individual or subjective characteristics and features must be ignored. It is not, and should not be, open to regard the same injury with the same physical consequences as amounting to actual bodily harm in one victim, and grievous bodily harm in another. This is particularly so in circumstances where the offender may not know of the individual features of the victim which give rise to the particular subjective consequences.
	
	
	To summarise, it seems to me that, based upon the authorities and the preceding discussion, the following principles can be stated with respect to the phrase “grievous bodily harm”:
	



	
	It is to be interpreted according to its natural and ordinary meaning;
	
	
	On its natural and ordinary meaning, the phrase means not just serious bodily injury, but really serious bodily injury;
	
	
	there is no bright-line by which an injury can be classified as really serious bodily injury; it is always a question of fact and degree;
	
	
	not every injury is capable of amounting to grievous bodily harm;
	
	
	only the injury itself and its direct physical effects, not its personal, social and economic consequences, can be taken into account in deciding whether an injury amounts to really serious bodily injury.
	


Discernment


	
	No challenge was made to the direction of the trial Judge to the jury with respect to what constituted grievous bodily harm. Nor was there any challenge to the trial Judge’s rejection of the no case submission made by the appellant’s counsel at the end of the Crown Case.
	
	
	Over the years, this Court has had the opportunity to consider a range of particular injuries, some of which have been held to constitute grievous bodily harm, others of which have been held only to constitute actual bodily harm. Beazley P, in her judgment in Haoui at [138]-[139], refers to a number of injuries which have been held to constitute grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The injury sustained in this case involved a fracture to a bone which was a part of a lumbar vertebra. Such an injury may be capable of amounting to grievous bodily harm. However, there are a number of features of the bony fracture in this case which tend against a conclusion that the victim suffered grievous bodily harm. These include:
	



	
	There was no displacement of the fracture;
	
	
	The fracture required no operative or other treatment, including ongoing medical consultation;
	
	
	There was no permanent injury;
	
	
	The victim was in hospital for a relatively short period and was released without any plan for further treatment;
	
	
	The doctor who saw and treated the victim described the injury as a “minor” one; and
	
	
	The victim did not visit any doctor for any treatment at any time after leaving hospital.
	



	
	Even if one were to look beyond the direct physical effects of the injury and take into account the victim’s subjective description of the consequences of the injury, the injury remains a relatively minor one. Mr Dewey described a few weeks of lower back pain after being discharged from hospital. He took no medication for his pain. His pain was measured by reference to weeks, and is not a permanent feature of his life. He now only experiences pain upon undertaking a small selection of physically strenuous activities.
	
	
	Consideration of these features of the victim’s injury demonstrates that the injury fails to answer the description of “serious bodily injury”, let alone “really serious bodily injury”. Whilst the question of whether an injury amounts to “really serious bodily injury” is one of fact and degree, and appropriately one for the jury’s assessment, that does not mean that all injuries will properly be assessed as really serious, or that this Court has no role to play in determining whether, on such an issue, the jury’s verdict is unreasonable.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, it is my opinion that the jury’s conclusion (essential to its verdict) that the appellant inflicted “grievous bodily harm” on Mr Dewey was an unreasonable one. Having regard to the nature of the injury, it is my opinion that the jury must have concluded that there was a real doubt that the injury amounted to grievous bodily harm. It could not have concluded that the Crown had established that element of the offence on Count 2 of the Indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Accordingly, the appeal must succeed and the appellant’s conviction on Count 2 of the Indictment must be quashed.
	


Alternative Verdict


	
	As already mentioned, the appellant submitted that if his conviction on Count 2 is quashed, then this Court ought to substitute a verdict of guilty on Count 3 of the Indictment for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The Crown agrees that that is an appropriate order. That order should be made.
	


Re-Sentence


	
	Substituting a verdict of guilty for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm requires this Court to impose an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company (the offence for which the jury convicted the appellant) is 14 years. The maximum sentence for the charge upon which he will now be convicted, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, is 7 years. No standard non-parole period applies.
	
	
	Undoubtedly, the resentencing of the appellant must reflect the significantly lower maximum penalty for the s 59(2) offence. Maximum penalties are legislative guideposts to which regard must be had on sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [27].
	
	
	The sentencing Judge sentenced the appellant upon the basis of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise. His Honour said:
	


“I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender actually struck Mr Dewey. His criminality is less than those who did, but in the circumstances of this case, where he was part of the mob and where he threw objects at Mr Dewey as part of his participation in the mob’s joint criminal enterprise, his conduct was, as his counsel recognises, seriously criminal.”


	
	I agree with the trial Judge’s description of the appellant as a “follower”. His participation in the events on the evening of 12 February 2013 reflects that assessment. That is the appropriate basis upon which to sentence the appellant for the substituted offence.
	
	
	I accept, as the trial Judge did, that there is a degree of overlap in the conduct constituting the offence of affray and the offence the subject of the substituted verdict. Dealing with the assault offence and having regard to the appellant’s role in occasioning actual bodily harm upon the victim, I am satisfied that the objective seriousness of the offence is in the mid-range.
	
	
	Having regard to the appellant’s personal background, I am satisfied, as was the trial Judge, that the appellant’s moral culpability is lessened having regard to his upbringing. The appellant has been assessed as having a very low level of intellectual functioning. He has also been assessed as someone who has not functioned well socially at any point in his life, and has been very much affected by ongoing conflict within his home. He has a significant lack of self-confidence and has had a chequered history of employment.
	
	
	There are clearly special circumstances in this case, in particular the appellant’s need to have significant assistance from the Probation and Parole Service after release from jail.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, an appropriate sentence is a non-parole period of 12 months with an additional term of 6 months.
	
	
	The original sentence was fixed to commence on 14 March 2015. That is a suitable commencement date.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted.
	
	
	Conviction for the offence contrary to s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company is quashed, and a verdict of acquittal on that offence is substituted.
	
	
	The appellant is convicted of the offence contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company.
	
	
	The appellant is sentenced with respect to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company to the following:
	



	
	a non-parole period of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 14 March 2015 and expiring on 13 March 2016;
	
	
	a balance of term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 14 March 2016 and expiring on 13 September 2016.
	



	
	WILSON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of R A Hulme and Garling JJ and gratefully adopt the outline of the evidence and relevant law set out by Garling J. I am, respectfully, unable to agree with the conclusion of their Honours as to the unreasonableness of the jury's verdict in relation to the element of grievous bodily harm in count 2. Since I am in the minority, my comments will be relatively brief.
	
	
	The appellant makes no complaint concerning the correctness of the trial Judge’s direction to the jury as to what constitutes grievous bodily harm and it can be concluded that the jury applied the law as directed.
	
	
	The assessment of the seriousness of the injury to Mr Dewey was one of fact for the jury. In concluding that the injury sustained by the victim was a really serious bodily injury, the jury plainly had regard to the evidence of Mr Dewey, but also to that given by Dr Ting. Whilst this was not an obvious and clear cut incidence of grievous bodily harm, the following features of the evidence of injury doubtless informed the conclusion of the jury that it was, nevertheless, grievous.
	



	
	The nature of the injury itself, being a fracture to the L3 spinal vertebra.
	
	
	The impossibility of the victim undertaking any physical work for a period of between four and six weeks, not because of the nature of his employment or considerations personal to Mr Dewey, but because the restriction was medically necessary to permit the fractured bone to repair itself, and because of the pain which typically attaches to an injury of this nature.
	
	
	Pain attributable to the injury, in any sufferer as distinct from Mr Dewey personally, could be expected to continue for between six weeks and three months, and it did continue in this instance.
	
	
	When referring to the injury as “minor”, Dr Ting referenced fractures to the spinal vertebrae, not injuries overall. The assessment of the spinal fracture as minor falls to be assessed in that context.
	
	
	The victim was required to be hospitalised for about two days to be monitored and treated.
	
	
	Mr Dewey deposed that he had been unable to walk properly for two to three days and that walking for a period of some weeks thereafter was a “struggle” which caused him pain. This evidence was not disputed at trial, and nor was it in any way inconsistent with Dr Ting’s evidence of what would be expected.
	
	
	At the time of trial, which was about sixteen months after the date on which the injury was occasioned, the victim continued to experience pain on physical activity, such as lifting heavy objects or piggybacking his children. There was no issue taken with this evidence.
	



	
	Although an injury such as that described in evidence at trial is, as the trial Judge described it during the sentence proceedings, “very much at the lower range of injuries encompassed by the expression grievous bodily harm”, I do not consider that it was unreasonable for the jury to conclude that the injury was grievous, or that such a conclusion was not open on the evidence. I am unable to find that the jury must have entertained a doubt as to proof beyond reasonable doubt concerning this element of the offence. That the jury could have reached a different conclusion is not sufficient to render the verdict unreasonable.
	
	
	In my view it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element of grievous bodily harm had been established: M v The Queen [1994] 181 CLR 487 at 493.
	
	
	On that basis, although I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.

		06 May 2016",2016-05-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701676,Gall v R [2016] NSWCCA 82,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: The applicant seeks leave, pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), to appeal against a determination of a judge of the District Court in relation to a pending trial of criminal proceedings in which he is charged with a number of serious offences.
	
	
	At the outset, an issue arises as to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the application. Section 5F(3)(a) allows an appeal, by leave, against “an interlocutory judgment or order”. The jurisdictional issue that arises is whether the determination the subject of the application is properly characterised as “an interlocutory judgment or order”. It will be necessary to consider that question as a preliminary issue.
	


Preliminary


	
	On 27 July 2015 the applicant was presented in the District Court on an indictment that contained seven counts under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). One count is of driving in a manner dangerous causing death; six are of driving in a manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm. All are offences of strict liability – that is, the Crown is under no obligation to prove any relevant state of mind or mens rea. All charges arise out of a single episode of driving, on 8 October 2012, at the Holsworthy Army Base in Sydney.
	
	
	When arraigned on the indictment, the applicant entered a plea of not guilty to each count. On his behalf, it was indicated that he proposed to defend the charges on the basis that, in driving the vehicle, he was acting “under superior orders”, as a result of which he was absolved of criminal liability for the death and the injuries.
	
	
	The Crown’s position was that such a defence is not known to the law (see A v Hayden (No 2) [1984] HCA 67; 156 CLR 532), and, in any event, could have no application to the facts of the present case. Since the applicant proposed to adduce evidence in support of the defence, and, (at least initially) to do so through cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, the parties sought a pre-trial ruling. No Notice of Motion was filed, with the result that the precise application was not formulated with any specificity. Counsel for the applicant said:
	


“… the first issue which we’d ask your Honour to determine is a question of law, which is whether or not there is a common law defence of superior orders that would be available to the charges on the indictment. The defence for which we contend, and in the form that we put it, has not been expressly ruled on by an Australian Court before and by Court I mean a civilian court.”


	
	Identification of what was in issue is of fundamental importance, for two reasons. The first is that s 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (pursuant to which, it may be assumed, the question was submitted to her Honour), permits a judge (who may not be the trial judge), before a jury is empanelled, to make any orders that may be made for the purposes of the trial, and s 130A makes those orders binding on the trial judge unless, in the opinion of the trial judge, that would not be in the interests of justice, or the order is inconsistent with an order made on appeal. That is, jurisdiction under s 130 to resolve issues in advance of the empanelment of a jury is limited to circumstances where the resolution of the issue involves the making of an order.
	
	
	Secondly, as indicated in [2] above, the jurisdiction of this Court depends upon there being an “interlocutory judgment or order”. Whether the issue raised involved the making of a judgment or order is in dispute.
	
	
	At the conclusion of argument, in a carefully considered judgment, Tupman DCJ ruled that, although a defence of superior orders does exist at common law (in certain circumstances), it is not available in the circumstances of the present case. Her final ruling was:
	


“I thus will not allow the defence to be put to the jury and on those findings the evidence sought to be relied upon in support of it will not be admissible and there will be no basis upon which the Crown will need to lead the evidence of rebuttal.”


	
	I now turn to outline the Crown and defence cases, so far as they can be discerned at this stage of proceedings.
	


The Crown case


	
	The evidence before her Honour was a Statement of Facts which the Crown proposed to prove (Criminal Procedure Act, s 142(1)(b)) and a response on behalf of the applicant (s 143(1)(b)).
	
	
	The Crown case may be outlined as follows.
	
	
	On 12 March 2012 (when he was 19 years of age) the applicant enlisted in the Australian Army. He completed his recruitment training in June 2012 (at the age of 20) and was posted to the School of Military Engineering at Holsworthy, with a view to qualifying as an Engineering Corps soldier. He was then temporarily attached to the Army School of Transport, and undertook a four week course of driver training and basic operational requirements for two kinds of vehicles – “Unimogs” and Land Rovers. A Unimog is a personnel carrier, used to transport personnel and equipment off road. The rear wagon is fitted with bench seats, but not with seatbelts or other restraints.
	
	
	Having completed the four week course, the applicant was assessed as competent to drive vehicles of either kind. He was then returned to the School of Military Engineering, where he was assigned duties as a driver to assist in a training exercise over six days commencing on 3 October 2012. In a Unimog, he transported numbers of Army trainees. The road on which he was required to drive was narrow, winding, uneven, unsealed and marked with potholes, dips and ruts. The terrain is marked by very steep hills, and in places the road is bordered by sheer cliffs.
	
	
	On at least three days between 6 and 8 October, the applicant drove the vehicle. On 8 October he was directed to convey 17 soldiers to a location on the range. There is a posted speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour. Two of the soldiers sat in the cabin with the applicant. 15 sat in the rear, unrestrained. The applicant was following another vehicle, carrying stores and equipment. At some point the applicant overtook the equipment vehicle. He was travelling at a speed well in excess of 40 kilometres per hour. His manner of driving was such as to cause alarm to some of the passengers, who demanded that he reduce speed. Nevertheless, the vehicle reached a speed of 80 kilometres per hour while negotiating a bend in the road. One of the passengers in the cabin suggested to the applicant that he reduce speed.
	
	
	Shortly after that, as the vehicle crested a sweeping left hand bend, the applicant lost control, and the vehicle rolled over. Soldiers in the rear, and equipment, were thrown from the vehicle and into nearby bushland. One soldier (Jordan Penpraze) was fatally injured. Six others suffered grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	At the commencement of the proceedings, the Crown stated its intention to rely on tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to the effect that, in the days prior to 8 October, the applicant had driven the vehicle in an erratic and dangerous manner, and at excessive speeds, that he had been counselled in relation to the manner of driving, and that he had been unreceptive to advice. (No s 97 notice was provided to this Court, and Tupman DCJ recorded, in her judgment, that this evidence was not relied on as tendency evidence. It is neither possible nor necessary to resolve this apparent conflict in these proceedings.)
	
	
	The Crown also intended to rely on admissions subsequently made by the applicant to the effect that he had been driving at excessive speed and that the rollover had been his fault.
	


The defence response


	
	The defence response identified the nature of the defence as threefold:
	



	
	that the applicant’s manner of driving was not dangerous;
	
	
	that the applicant was:
	


“… excused from any criminal responsibility arising from his driving at the time of the accident, as he was ordered by his superior officer to drive in accordance with his training and compliance with that order was not manifestly unlawful.”


	
	that the applicant was excused from any criminal responsibility by reason of a number of honest and reasonable mistakes that caused the incident.
	



	
	With respect to the factual outline of the Crown case, the response stated that, prior to his enlistment in the Army, the applicant’s driving experience had been limited “to a few lessons with a driving instructor in an automatic car” for which he held a “civilian driver’s licence”. (It may be that the word “permit” was intended.) Although the training course that the applicant undertook in the Army began on 3 September, he was not permitted to commence until 4 September, thereby missing the first day of training. He completed a personal particulars form that stated that he had “little driving experience and held ‘L’s’ in automatic”. The training course was limited to 18 hours in the Land Rover, 14 hours in a Unimog, and was also limited in the scope of activity. The applicant had never driven with passengers in the rear of a Unimog, and had never driven on a gravel road at speed. Although he was issued by the Army with a licence to drive the vehicles, he was incompetent to do so.
	
	
	The applicant denied the allegations of erratic or dangerous driving, both on 8 October, and on the days preceding.
	
	
	The response then outlined the proposed defence, and concluded:
	


“29  The accused seeks a ruling, pursuant to s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act, that as a matter of law there is a defence to the offences with which the accused is charged, excusing him from criminal responsibility for complying with an order, where engaging in the conduct the subject of the order is not manifestly unlawful. If the Court determines that it is bound by Hayden [A v Hayden (No 2), see above] the accused would seek a certificate or leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) prior to the commencement of the trial.”


	
	Essentially, the applicant seeks to defend the charges on the basis that he was given inadequate training to drive a vehicle of the kind he was driving; that he was not competent to drive such a vehicle, particularly having regard to the circumstances of the terrain over which he was directed to convey the passengers; that he was, nevertheless directed to drive the vehicle with the trainees on board; and that, in the light of the disciplinary regime of the Army, he was in no position to refuse to comply with that direction. He was, therefore, acting under “superior orders” when he drove the vehicle.
	
	
	The response of the Crown is that, even accepting that the applicant was directed to drive the vehicle, he was not directed to do so in a dangerous manner. Whatever role the disciplinary regime of the Army played in the applicant being at the wheel of the vehicle, it had no part to play in the manner in which the applicant complied with the direction to drive it.
	


Jurisdiction


	
	Jurisdiction under s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act depends upon there being “an interlocutory judgment or order”. It is well established that a ruling on the admissibility of evidence does not come within that category: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; Steffan v R (1993) 30 NSWLR 633. Nor does a preliminary ruling of a judge given in advance of matters affecting the trial: R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213 at 220; and see the comprehensive discussion by R A Hulme J in A2 v R; KM v R; Vaziri v R [2015] NSWCCA 244.
	
	
	The above outline shows that it is quite clear that the question submitted to the trial judge had two components. One component was concerned with the rulings on evidence that she would make during the course of the trial. If she accepted that there did not exist in Australian law a defence of compliance with “superior orders”, or that it was not available in the circumstances of the present case, then cross-examination of Crown witnesses would be limited, and would exclude as irrelevant evidence relating to the inadequacy of the applicant’s training, his competence (or otherwise) to drive the vehicle, and any evidence the Crown would seek to have admitted in rebuttal of those propositions. It would also, of course, exclude any evidence to that effect sought to be given by or on behalf of the applicant. If, on the other hand, the trial judge held that there was such a defence, her rulings on the admissibility of evidence would be affected to some extent. But the issue was still as to the evidence that could be admitted. Powch and Steffan are conclusive authority that such rulings do not come within s 5F(3)(a).
	
	
	The second part of the question submitted was no more nor less than an advance ruling on what the trial judge might put to the jury at the conclusion of the trial by way of summing up the defence case; it was excluded from the operation of s 5F(3)(a) by the principle stated in Edelsten.
	
	
	Accordingly, the application should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
	


The substance


	
	It is appropriate, nonetheless, to comment briefly upon the merits of the proposed defence. In Hayden, it was unequivocally held by all members of the Court, as summarised in the headnote to the Commonwealth Law Reports report of the judgments, that:
	


“There is no place for a general defence of superior orders or of Crown or executive fiat in Australian criminal law.”


	
	Counsel for the applicant sought to distinguish Hayden on the basis that that decision, properly understood, was concerned with compliance with unlawful orders (which, in that case, the relevant orders were). On that argument, the doctrine has no application to “apparently lawful” orders, such as a direction to the applicant to drive the Unimog.
	
	
	It is immediately apparent that this proposition calls for close examination of what, on the applicant’s case, was “the lawful order” given to him. He did not, and could not, contend that the order to drive the Unimog was unlawful. It was no part of his case that he was directed to drive the Unimog in a dangerous manner – that is, unlawfully. His case is that he was given a lawful order – to drive the Unimog – but that, given his inadequate training and incompetence, he could only comply with the order by driving the Unimog in a dangerous manner. Put differently, compliance with the apparently lawful order necessitated driving in a manner that was dangerous. But if, as the applicant contends, an essential incident of compliance with the order to drive the vehicle was doing so dangerously then it is difficult to see how the order could be anything other than unlawful – and squarely within Hayden.
	
	
	Somewhat ironically, the applicant’s case on this application depends upon acceptance that he drove the Unimog in a dangerous manner. If that were not so, he could not be convicted of the offences, notwithstanding the death and injury caused in the accident. Thus, unless it were concluded that his manner of driving was dangerous, there is no call for consideration of the defence he proposes to make. However, once it is established that his manner of driving was dangerous, his proposed defence of compliance with superior orders falls away, because, on no view of the direction he was given, could he be said to have been directed to drive in a dangerous manner.
	
	
	Even if leave were granted, it would be necessary to dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	The order I propose is:
	


Application for leave to appeal refused.


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Simpson JA.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Simpson JA.

2701678,R v Tuhakaraina [2016] NSWCCA 81,"Judgment


	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Wilson J.
	
	
	GARLING J: Although I agree with the order proposed by Wilson J, I desire to state my own reasons.
	
	
	The Crown conceded in the course of argument on this appeal that in respect of Ground 2 of the appeal, it “… would be in some difficulty in arguing that the head sentence was manifestly inadequate.” The Crown accepted that the thrust of the appeal was directed to the non-parole period component of the total term of imprisonment.
	
	
	Consideration of the total sentence, and the facts and matters upon which it was based, satisfies me that it was not manifestly inadequate. It did not fall outside of the range of sentences properly available to the learned sentencing Judge. There is no basis to uphold the Crown’s appeal by reference to Ground 2.
	
	
	The decision by the learned sentencing Judge to vary the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall sentence from that prescribed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), was a discretionary one involving an evaluative judgment which depended upon a number of findings of fact: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 at [73]; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 (“Simpson”); Allen v R [2015] NSWCCA 113 at [33].
	
	
	A non-parole period fixed by the sentencing Judge is to be seen as the minimum period of actual incarceration which justice requires the offender to serve, having regard to all of the circumstances of the offence: see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629; Simpson at [57]; Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [57].
	
	
	The sentencing Judge’s remarks do not disclose any error in her reasoning about the existence of special circumstances (although not explicitly so described) nor the facts which went to support that conclusion. Given the nature of the making of a finding of special circumstances, this Court is slow to intervene with such a finding (or perhaps a lack of a finding): see Mitrevski v R [2015] NSWCCA 137 at [56], and the authorities there cited.
	
	
	It seems to me that such an approach ought to be taken by this Court when considering the extent of the reduction imposed by the sentencing Judge by reference to the special circumstances proved by the evidence. Put differently, where a sentencing Judge has identified and considered circumstances which can properly be described as amounting to special circumstances, and in their discretion has determined that the statutory ratio should be varied so as to provide a shorter non-parole period than that contained within the legislation, this Court would be slow to find error, or to intervene.
	
	
	There is, and can be, no bright-line by which a sentencing Judge, or this Court on appeal, can judge the adequacy or inadequacy of the non-parole period imposed. If this Court is satisfied that the non-parole period imposed is one which reflects the principles to which I have earlier referred, then no error has been demonstrated. Such determination requires a consideration of all of the relevant circumstances.
	
	
	For my part, I accept that the non-parole period fixed in this case was lenient. However, I am not satisfied that the non-parole period fixed failed to meet the sentencing objectives of the relevant legislation, nor that it fell below the minimum time which the sentencing Judge ought to have determined was required for the offender, as a matter of justice, to serve.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would not uphold the Crown appeal on the first ground.
	
	
	It follows from this conclusion that I agree with the order proposed by Wilson J, namely, that the appeal ought to be dismissed.
	
	
	WILSON J: On 27 November 2015 her Honour Judge Sweeney, sitting in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney, imposed a sentence upon Lui Tuhakaraina (“the respondent”) with respect to a single count of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, an offence contrary to s 52A(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the Crown was that the prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in the respondent’s breath or blood, as contemplated by s 52A(7) of the same Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for such an offence is a term of 11 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period specified by s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	A sentence of imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months was imposed upon the respondent, to date from 27 November 2015 and expiring on 26 May 2018. Having found that special circumstances existed pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, her Honour fixed a non-parole period of 6 months. The respondent is to be released to parole on 26 May 2016.
	
	
	By Notice of Appeal filed on 9 December 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against that sentence. Two grounds of appeal are advanced (set out in the order referred to in the Crown’s written submissions):
	



	
	Her Honour erred in the manner in which she took into account the ill health of the respondent’s partner and, as a result, reduced the non-parole period to an impermissible extent.
	
	
	The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.
	


The Evidence before the Sentencing Judge

The Facts of the Crime


	
	The sentence proceedings commenced before her Honour on 24 September 2015. The Crown tendered a statement of facts, the accuracy of which was not disputed by the respondent. The following account is drawn from that evidence.
	
	
	On the day of the offence, Monday 25 August 2014, the respondent was the driver of a Mitsubishi Lancer, which he had driven to work. During his lunch break, between 11am and 12pm, the respondent drank five 375ml stubbies of full strength beer.
	
	
	Later, at about 2.30 in the afternoon, the respondent drove to a nearby hotel where he parked his car. He went into the hotel and remained there between about 2.30 and 3.15, consuming four schooners of full strength beer in that time.
	
	
	On leaving the hotel the respondent returned to his car and drove off. His departure in the car was captured by the hotel’s closed circuit surveillance system.
	
	
	The respondent drove onto The River Road at Revesby, and turned west into Marco Avenue at about 3.25pm. There is a railway station on this street, and the speed limit is posted at forty kilometres per hour. There are four pedestrian crossings on the section of roadway traversed by the respondent. The respondent next turned into Polo Street and thence Bransgrove Road at Revesby, both residential streets.
	
	
	The respondent commenced a right turn from Bransgrove Road into Simmons Street at Revesby. In executing the turn, he failed to give way to an oncoming motorcyclist and collided with the bike. The rider of the bike, Jeffery Woods, was injured when his right leg was caught between the bike and the respondent’s car, and crushed. Mr Woods was further injured when the bike thereafter fell to the left and slid along the roadway, with his left leg between the road surface and the bike. After a short distance, Mr Woods and the bike separated with Mr Woods coming to a stop some distance from his bike.
	
	
	The respondent parked his car in Simmons Street and got out of it. He remained standing by his car for some minutes before walking the short distance to his home. He did not stop to check on Mr Woods’ condition, and did nothing to obtain assistance for him.
	
	
	Having obtained the registration details for the respondent’s car, investigating police went to his home where they found the respondent sitting outside. He acknowledged having been the driver of the car at the time of the collision, and returned to the crash site with them.
	
	
	The officers observed the respondent to be unsteady on his feet, and his movements exaggerated and slow. His eyes were glazed and he smelt strongly of alcohol. A roadside breath test for alcohol was positive, and the respondent was thereupon taken to hospital where blood and urine samples were obtained from him.
	
	
	Some days later the respondent attended a police station voluntarily to be interviewed about the crash. He gave police an account of the drive preceding the crash which was not consistent with surveillance footage or witness accounts. He acknowledged having been drinking prior to the collision, and conceded that an account that he had given to police at the scene of having consumed alcohol after the crash was not true.
	
	
	Dr Judith Perl, a Forensic Pharmacologist, provided an opinion that at the time of the crash the respondent would have had a blood alcohol concentration within a range of 0.187 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and 0.207 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, with the most likely reading being 0.194 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Even at the lowest end of that range, the respondent’s ability to drive would have been very substantially impaired.
	
	
	After the collision, Mr Woods was taken by ambulance to hospital, where he was treated for a number of injuries, including fractures to his right leg at the hip joint, just above the knee, and to the lower leg; a dislocated right ankle; a fractured left kneecap; a significant laceration to the right ankle; and ligament damage. He underwent a number of surgical procedures to repair the fractures, including the insertion of pins, plates, and screws; a skin graft was required to repair the ankle laceration. Although the ultimate efficacy of those various procedures was not fully determined at the time when sentence was imposed, it is likely that Mr Woods will suffer lifelong functional impairment, as well as ongoing chronic pain and stiffness in his ankle.
	
	
	Prior to the collision in which Mr Woods was injured the respondent had travelled about 1.5 kilometres, through areas with high pedestrian traffic, and at a time of day when many people, including children making their way home from school, could be expected to be on the streets.
	


Other Evidence in the Crown Case on Sentence


	
	In a victim impact statement read to and received by the sentencing judge pursuant to s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, Mr Woods described the terrible impact that the crash had had on his health and life. He referred to months spent in great pain, with ongoing pain, restricted movement, and a lack of independence. Mr Woods’ capacity to earn an income was adversely effected, as was his quality of life. His life changed dramatically as a consequence of the crash.
	
	
	The sentencing judge was additionally provided with the respondent’s traffic and criminal antecedents. The respondent had no prior criminal convictions but he had a number of traffic entries recorded against him. The respondent was first licenced in New South Wales in 1999. He had a brief fine default suspension in 1999, and a demerit point suspension for three months in 2009- 2010. The demerit points had accrued for infringements including a number of speeding offences and disobeying a traffic sign.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report provided information as to the respondent’s personal circumstances and history. The respondent was born in New Zealand and was aged 49 years old at the time of sentence. He was one of eight children to loving and supportive parents.
	
	
	The applicant is married to his wife of twenty-six years and the couple have a (now adult) son. The family moved to Australia in 1999 where the respondent gained employment as a scaffolder, an occupation he has pursued since he was a young man. At the time of the sentence proceedings the respondent was working on a casual basis five or six days each week.
	
	
	At about age twenty the respondent began drinking alcohol to excess, binge drinking, initially in the context of sporting activities. This became a weekly event. The respondent told the author of the pre-sentence report that, since the crash, he had engaged in psychological and alcohol rehabilitation counselling in an attempt to address his problematic drinking. He also completed the Traffic Offenders Programme.
	
	
	The respondent expressed remorse for his offending behaviour to the author of the pre-sentence report.
	


The Subjective Case


	
	The respondent both gave and adduced evidence to the sentencing judge on 24 September 2015.
	
	
	In his evidence the respondent said that he was first licenced to drive at about the age of twenty years, and had been licensed in both New Zealand and Australia.
	
	
	Following the collision he said that he got out of his car and checked on Mr Woods, before returning to his car and parking it in Simmons Street. He said that after waiting for a period at his car, he walked home as he needed to use a bathroom. He said that he made no attempt to contact police or an ambulance as he believed that emergency services had already been summonsed.
	
	
	The respondent told the sentencing judge that he had consulted two psychologists following the crash, and had undertaken both the Positive Lifestyle Programme and the Traffic Offenders Programme. He said that, whilst his alcohol consumption had slowed a bit, he had been going through hard times. He apologised for what he had done and the harm caused to Mr Woods and said that he thought about the crash every day.
	
	
	He referred to medical conditions from which he suffered, including asthma and gout, and to his wife’s heart condition.
	
	
	A letter written by the respondent was also tendered to the sentencing court, in which the respondent expressed his shame at his actions, apologised to Mr Woods, and evinced an intention never again to drink and drive.
	
	
	In cross-examination the respondent conceded having a problem with alcohol, and acknowledged that he continued to consume alcohol as it helped him cope with stress.
	
	
	The respondent’s wife, Arahana Mihinui, also gave evidence before the sentencing judge and provided a letter she had written in support of him. Somewhat in contrast to the respondent’s evidence, she deposed that her husband’s drinking had dropped so dramatically since the crash that he didn’t drink much at all. She confirmed his history of asthma and gout.
	
	
	As to her own health, Ms Mihinui deposed that she had an erratic heart beat and had previously experienced seizures during which she collapsed and lost consciousness. She was treated in New Zealand for her condition and, ultimately, was fitted with a defibrillator (in 2012) to monitor and regulate her heart rate, and to administer an electric shock or shocks during seizures. The seizures occurred without warning, there having been four such attacks following the implantation of the defibrillator. She deposed that she had been told her condition was life threatening.
	
	
	Ms Mihinui said that the respondent had always been present on the occasions when she had experienced a seizure and been able to call an ambulance for her. She was frightened by the prospect of a seizure occurring when he was not present. She acknowledged in cross-examination that she had other family living in Sydney.
	
	
	Confirming the evidence concerning Ms Mihinui’s medical condition was a report from her treating cardiologist, Associate Professor Michael Kilborn, in which her situation was described as,
	


“[…] completely life threatening and involv[ing] recurrent ventricular tachycardia causing effective cardiac arrest and blackouts.”


	
	The report, tendered on 27 November 2014 continued,
	


“These episodes are very serious. They may cause blackouts and need for hospital treatment. The specific risks if she has an episode are death, collapse, and injury from falling. When she is having an episode she is completely helpless and having someone to help her substantially reduces the risk of such an episode being of lasting consequence or even fatal.”


	
	The episodes were noted to occur unpredictably, and could be precipitated by stress.
	
	
	Reports from psychologists Neil Balladie and Carolyn Mutch were tendered by the respondent.
	
	
	Mr Balladie began treating the respondent in November 2014 following a referral from his general practitioner. The respondent completed a self-report designed to measure the severity of symptoms common to stress, depression, and anxiety, with Mr Balladie concluding that he was highly stressed and depressed. He opined that the respondent’s depressive condition probably existed prior to the crash, but the circumstances surrounding the crash and the subsequent criminal proceedings had worsened it.
	
	
	The respondent acknowledged to Mr Balladie that he used alcohol to excess to cope with stress, and understood that his drinking was problematic. He expressed considerable remorse for his actions and the consequences.
	
	
	Mr Balladie concluded that the respondent was an intelligent and insightful individual, who had resorted to alcohol to help him deal with depression and stress, but who had the capacity to rehabilitate himself. He expressed concern at the potentially damaging effect of a custodial sentence.
	
	
	Ms Mutch, a psychologist and drug and alcohol counsellor at a community health service, confirmed in a short report of September 2015 that she had provided counselling to the respondent, at his initiative, since April 2015. She outlined the nature of the counselling provided and reported the respondent’s stated aim of achieving alcohol abstention.
	


The Remarks of the Sentencing Judge


	
	In her remarks the sentencing judge set out the facts of the respondent’s crime, which she referred to as agreed facts. Despite that characterisation of them, her Honour accepted the evidence given by the respondent - contrary to the facts – that he had gone immediately to check on Mr Woods following the crash. Her Honour concluded that this ameliorated conduct which would otherwise indicate a disregard for the motorcyclist’s welfare.
	
	
	The sentencing judge set out in detail the injuries to Mr Woods and the terrible ongoing consequence of those injuries.
	
	
	Referring to the opinion as to the respondent’s impairment provided by Dr Perl, the sentencing judge concluded that his blood alcohol content at the time of the crash represented, at 0.187 millilitres of alcohol per litre of blood, a significant increment on the threshold for the offence of 0.15.
	
	
	She noted that, although the respondent had travelled only a short distance, being about 1.4 kilometres, he had nevertheless posed a danger to others since, at 3.30 in the afternoon on residential streets, there were likely to be people about. That danger manifested in the crash in which Mr Woods was grievously injured. Her Honour described the offence as “serious”, and the respondent’s moral culpability as “high”.
	
	
	She indicated an intention to allow the respondent a discount of 25% on the sentence that would have otherwise been imposed to reflect the respondent’s early plea of guilty to the charge.
	
	
	The sentencing judge set out in detail the respondent’s personal circumstances and, referring to the report from Mr Balladie, noted that the respondent now accepted that he had had a problem with alcohol at the time of the crash, excessive alcohol consumption being at least in part a mechanism to assist him to cope with the grief occasioned at his father’s death in June 2014.
	
	
	Her Honour regarded the counselling and courses the respondent had undertaken since the crash as being to his credit, and indicative of significant steps towards rehabilitation.
	
	
	She accepted that the respondent was genuine in his expressions of shame and remorse.
	
	
	Her Honour noted that the respondent had not driven since the crash. (Contrary to that statement, the respondent had continued to drive until the suspension of his driver’s licence on 14 November 2014, and had incurred an infringement for negligent driving on 16 October 2014.)
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent was at a low risk of re-offending.
	
	
	Referring to the asthma and gout from which the respondent suffered, the sentencing judge noted that his ill health and depressive condition, whilst able to be managed in a custodial setting, would make any custodial sentence more onerous for the respondent than for persons without such conditions.
	
	
	Her Honour then turned to the cardiac condition suffered by the respondent’s wife, setting out in full detail the nature of the illness, its impact upon Ms Mihinui, and the desirability of her having her husband with her in the event of a seizure. Ultimately, the sentencing judge reduced the non-parole period to be imposed upon the respondent because of his wife’s ill health.
	


The Arguments on Appeal

The Crown’s Submissions


	
	As noted above at [16] the Crown appeals against the sentence on two grounds, being error in the manner in which the sentencing judge treated the medical condition suffered by the respondent’s wife, and manifest inadequacy.
	
	
	In relation to ground one, the Crown submits that, although Ms Mihinui’s condition is not an exceptional circumstance as referred to in R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516 (“Edwards”), and the sentencing judge concluded as much, this feature of the respondent’s subjective case was nevertheless given undue weight, and influenced her Honour to reduce the non-parole period to an impermissible extent, such that it was incapable of adequately reflecting the gravity of the crime or fulfilling the purposes of sentencing.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions in support of ground two rely to a significant extent on the arguments advanced in support of ground one. Conceding at the hearing of the matter before this Court that the Crown’s real complaint was with the non-parole period rather than the head sentence, the Crown argued that a non-parole period of six months, being only 20% of the head sentence imposed, was inadequate to reflect the gravity of an offence involving a blood alcohol reading significantly above the threshold level, where significant and lasting injury had been inflicted.
	
	
	The Crown contended that this was not a matter where the Court’s residual discretion to decline to intervene to correct an erroneous sentence should be exercised, because of the need for strong denunciation for offences such as this, and where there has been no delay or other impropriety by the Crown concerning the matter.
	


The Respondent’s Submissions


	
	In relation to ground one the respondent acknowledged that the sentencing judge gave great weight to the issue of Ms Mihinui’s medical condition, but contended that it was open to her Honour to make a finding of special circumstances on that and a number of other bases, and to reduce the non-parole period in the exercise of her discretion.
	
	
	Attention was called to the absence of any obligatory ratio of non-parole period to head sentence following a finding of special circumstances, and to the “deeply entrenched sentencing practice” in the District Court of imposing “very significant variations to the statutory ratio” (respondent’s written submissions at [31]).
	
	
	With respect to ground two the respondent noted that, without the application of the discount on sentence of 25%, the head sentence was one of three years and four months, and such a sentence was broadly consistent with sentencing patterns established by the statistics for this offence held by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales.
	
	
	The respondent argued that, even if error was found, the overall sentence imposed was not so inconsistent with community expectations as to warrant the intervention of this Court.
	
	
	The respondent also drew attention to the close proximity of the date specified for the respondent to be released to parole, 26 May 2016, arguing that to increase his sentence at such a late stage was unfair to him.
	


Consideration


	
	Since the arguments advanced by the Crown in support of ground two rely upon and reflect those in support of ground one, both grounds are here considered together. Given the Crown’s concession that the head sentence imposed upon the respondent was, whilst lenient, within the range of the valid exercise of the sentencing discretion, the focus of the Crown’s submissions before this Court was in support of ground one, and the asserted inadequacy of the non-parole period.
	
	
	It is clear from both the transcript of the proceedings on sentence in the District Court and from the remarks of the sentencing judge that there was considerable focus on the medical condition suffered by the respondent’s wife. It was there argued by the respondent that the dangerousness of Ms Mihinui’s situation amounted to an exceptional circumstance such that a sentence other than full time imprisonment should be considered.
	
	
	Having heard the evidence adduced by both parties on 24 September 2015, the sentencing judge suggested to the respondent’s representative that, if it was proposed to rely upon Ms Mihinui’s condition as a basis for the imposition of a community-based sentence, further evidence of it should be provided to the court. It was on the basis of her Honour’s suggestion that an adjournment was sought to obtain a medical report.
	
	
	After receiving the additional evidence (the report from Associate Professor Kilborn), her Honour imposed sentence, noting that,
	


“I have been troubled by the tensions between the seriousness of Mr Tuhakaraina’s offence and the consequences for his victim, and the risks associated with Ms Mihinui’s medical condition.”


	
	Although her Honour went on to reject the respondent’s contention that this feature of the case was an exceptional circumstance justifying a non-custodial sentence (correctly in my view), she appears to have concluded that it did amount to a special circumstance justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. Without referring to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, or using the phrase “special circumstances” which is found in that provision, the sentencing judge said,
	


“I have come to the view that because of the seriousness of his offence Mr Tuhakaraina must spend some time in custody. However, I have taken into account his partner’s condition to reduce the non-parole period from the statutory ratio.”


	
	The Crown accepted in submission to this Court that it was open to the sentencing judge to make a finding of special circumstances and a consequent adjustment to the usual statutory ratio of sentence, a concession which is properly made.
	
	
	Whilst the need for transparency in sentence is such that it would have been preferable for her Honour to clearly articulate her finding of special circumstances and the reasons for it, it is plain that she did make such a finding. It is equally plain that there were features of the respondent’s case, including his wife’s medical condition, which provided a legitimate basis for that finding.
	
	
	There was evidence before the sentencing judge which established that the respondent had a depressive condition which was inextricably intertwined with his alcoholism, and that he was in need of treatment, treatment which was best provided in a community setting. The fact that the respondent had already undertaken some counselling and other psychological treatment to address these disorders, with some positive result, provided a basis for concluding that special circumstances existed.
	
	
	Additionally, a further basis for a finding of special circumstances is found in the sentencing judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s ill health and depressive disorder would make a sentence of imprisonment more burdensome on him than it would otherwise be.
	
	
	Whilst these conclusions did not oblige her Honour to adjust the ratio of sentence, that being a discretionary matter, it entitled her to do so.
	
	
	There is, however, nothing in her Honour’s remarks to suggest that the finding of special circumstances that she must have made to adjust the ratio of sentence as she did was based on these features of the respondent’s case. Rather, it is apparent that the decision to vary the ratio rested solely on considerations connected with Ms Mihinui’s heart condition. Her Honour said as much in the extract set out at [79] above.
	
	
	There is authority that supports a conclusion that the welfare of a third party, even not amounting to a circumstance of extreme hardship, can be taken into account by a sentencing judge as part of an offender’s subjective case when fixing the sentence to be imposed upon an offender: R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21]; Dipangkear v R [2010] NSWCCA 156 at [41] where such an approach was referred to as “lenient”; Delaney v R [2013] NSWCCA 150 at [81].
	
	
	It is important however that, where such a matter is taken into consideration, it is not allowed to take on such significance as to be treated as a case of the sort envisioned in Edwards, where it is the impact upon the third party of itself that justifies a reduction in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed.
	
	
	In the present case, her Honour was entitled to have regard to the situation of the respondent’s wife insofar as it was relevant to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. There was evidence before the sentencing court (in the report of Mr Balladie) that the respondent’s depression and anxiety had been exacerbated by his feelings of guilt and anxiety over the consequences to his wife of his likely incarceration. The exacerbation of those conditions led in turn to a greater need for treatment and rehabilitation, and to the likelihood that the respondent would experience a custodial sentence as more onerous than would otherwise have been the case, and more onerous than for prisoners without that added layer of anxiety.
	
	
	This provided a proper basis for a finding of special circumstances and some appropriate reduction in the non-parole period pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	The real question here is whether, having made a finding of special circumstances that it was open to the court to make, her Honour erred in the extent to which she reduced the non-parole period, leading to a non-parole period that was incapable of performing the functions required by s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and of adequately reflecting the seriousness of the respondent’s crime. In my view, her Honour did fall into error in varying the non-parole period to the very significant extent that she did.
	
	
	Although it is neither necessary nor prudent to state any general rule or formula for the determination of a proper ratio of sentence once a finding of special circumstances has been made, that being a discretionary matter in any event, it should be very rare indeed for a non-parole period to comprise only twenty per cent of an overall sentence. It could only be in the most extraordinary circumstances that such a ratio of sentence could be justified. That is because, absent some highly exceptional feature, it is difficult to see how a non-parole period of twenty per cent of the head sentence could perform the manifold functions of sentence specified by s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, including as they do punishment, denunciation, making an offender accountable, recognition of harm, and general deterrence.
	
	
	Relying upon Judicial Commission statistics reported in 2002 and referred to in R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 (“Fidow”) at [21], the respondent submitted that this Court should asses the non-parole period imposed in this instance by reference to a deeply entrenched pattern of sentencing in the District Court, where special circumstances were regularly found to exist, and non-parole periods were frequently reduced to an amount of less than fifty per cent of the head sentence.
	
	
	It should be noted that Fidow made reference to now dated statistics and the apparent practice they reflected to decry that practice; this Court can hardly rely upon an erroneous and discredited practice to support what occurred in this case.
	
	
	Whilst the extent of the reduction in the non-parole period allowed to an offender after a finding of special circumstances has been made is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge, the discretion will miscarry where the non-parole period fails to reflect the gravity of the offence, or where it fails to reflect the finding of special circumstances itself.
	
	
	The health of the respondent’s wife, whilst a consideration to be taken into account as part of the respondent’s subjective case (since it had an adverse impact on the respondent’s psychological health) was not something which could justify a departure of this magnitude from the statutory ratio of sentence. Some very modest adjustment would have been an appropriate reflection of it.
	
	
	The respondent’s crime was a very serious example of aggravated dangerous driving. A blood alcohol level of 0.187 millilitres per 100 grams is in excess of the threshold level of 0.15 to a considerable degree and, more significantly, it reflects a level of impairment in driving ability substantially greater than that which might accompany a lower reading. The respondent would have been well aware that he was not fit to drive, but drove nevertheless, and through suburban residential streets in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, where the risk he posed to others was considerable.
	
	
	The dangerousness of the respondent’s conduct manifested in the terrible injuries inflicted on Mr Woods. Whilst it is true, as the respondent submitted, that more serious examples of grievous bodily harm are caught within s 52A of the Crimes Act, the injuries inflicted on the victim as a consequence of the respondent’s conduct were very serious and will endure at some level throughout his life. A custodial sentence and non-parole period of some length was required to reflect that harm.
	
	
	Whilst the head sentence might be regarded as a very lenient sentence, albeit one within the legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion, such a crime warranted a considerably higher non-parole period than that which was in fact imposed. In my view, any reduction of the non-parole period lower than sixty per cent of the total, in the particular circumstances of this case, would result in a sentence that failed entirely to reflect the seriousness of the offence.
	
	
	I accept the Crown’s submission that the sentencing judge fell into error in giving such determinative weight to the health of the respondent’s wife, and as a consequence of that error, reduced the non-parole period to such an extent that it was incapable of adequately addressing the magnitude of the respondent’s crime, or meeting the requirements of sentencing more generally.
	
	
	I would, subject to the exercise of residual discretion, uphold these grounds of appeal.
	


Should this Court Intervene to Re-sentence the Respondent?


	
	Whilst the Crown has a right of appeal against sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the efficacy of that right has been limited to a degree by the principles that govern Crown appeals. As the High Court made clear in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462; [2011] HCA 49 at [1], the primary purpose of an appeal by the Crown is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of the courts which have the duty of sentencing offenders. Appellate courts retain the discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even where, as here, it is erroneously lenient.
	
	
	In considering whether to exercise the discretion, relevant considerations include consistency in the application of sentencing principles so that sentences imposed by the courts for the same offences are broadly uniform within a legitimate range of sentence, and the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of criminal justice. Another consideration of some importance in the context of an offence of this nature is the need to give effect to the requirement for denunciation and general deterrence. The sentence imposed at first instance could do little to meet those requirements.
	
	
	Each of those considerations would ordinarily militate in favour of intervention by this Court to resentence the respondent, and increase the non-parole period imposed upon him.
	
	
	However, although the Crown’s appeal was filed promptly and prosecuted quickly, and there has been no failure by the Crown in relation to this matter, the hearing of the appeal was considerably delayed because this Court did not give the appeal the necessary level of priority. That has had the consequence of leaving the respondent anxiously awaiting the resolution of his appeal for almost the whole of the non-parole period fixed upon him by the sentencing judge. To intervene at this late stage and resentence the respondent by tripling the non-parole period he is to serve - as I believe is necessary to achieve an adequate non-parole period - would work an unfairness on the respondent.
	
	
	For that reason I would not intervene to resentence the respondent.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is dismissed.

2701681,Davie v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 96,"Headnote

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant has been found guilty of sexual offences against children on three occasions, and has served substantial terms of imprisonment. On 20 March 2015, prior to the expiry of the sentence imposed on the third occasion, the State commenced proceedings seeking interim and final continuing detention orders under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). On 14 April 2015, the primary judge, Button J, made an interim continuing detention order under s 18A of the Act and orders for the appointment of psychiatrists under s 15(4). On 16 July 2015, his Honour made a continuing detention order with a term of 12 months under s 17(1)(b). His Honour stated his satisfaction that the appellant was a “high risk sex offender” and that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order: s 5D of the Act.

The appellant appealed pursuant to s 22. He brought two grounds of appeal: first, that the primary judge erred in finding that he was satisfied that adequate supervision would not be provided by the making of an extended supervision order, including by failing to have regard to certain relevant matters; and secondly, that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in making a continuing detention order, including by failing to consider that, even if he was satisfied in respect of adequate supervision, he had a discretionary power not to make a continuing detention order.

The Court held:

In relation to ground 1:

(1)   His Honour had regard to the reports of the psychiatric experts appointed under s 15(4) of the Act. He correctly summarised the evidence of each of the experts, including that as to the appellant’s attitude to taking anti-libidinal medication. He did not err in finding that the appellant had expressed no real willingness to take such medication. [76]-[79].

(2)   His Honour did not err in his consideration of the evidence relating to the therapy and risk management strategies which would be available to the appellant if he were released subject to an extended supervision order. In particular, his finding, on the basis of that evidence, that no appropriate therapy was available to the appellant in the community was open to him. [80].

(3)   His Honour did not err in failing to take into account those conditions of the proposed extended supervision order which related to medical intervention and treatment. Having regard to the evidence as to the appellant’s unwillingness to take anti-libidinal medication and the absence of appropriate therapy in the community, the basis for those conditions was not in play. Further, the primary judge was not bound by authority to place the appellant on an extended supervision order so as to give him an opportunity to give informed consent. [81]-[90].

State of New South Wales v Cruse (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 128; State of New South Wales v Atkins [2014] NSWSC 292

(4)   His Honour did not err in finding that he was satisfied pursuant to s 5D(1) that adequate supervision of the appellant would not be provided by an extended supervision order. [91].

In relation to ground 2:

(5)   His Honour’s reasons, properly understood, indicate that he did not fail to consider whether, having found that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order, he ought to exercise his discretion not to make a continuing detention order. [100].

(6)   His Honour did not fail to have regard to the appellant’s rehabilitation. A consideration of that factor was implicit in his consideration of the evidence as to the psychiatric and other treatment needed by the appellant to control his offending behaviour. [102]-[106].

(7)   His Honour also did not err in failing to have regard to the serious consequences to the appellant of being detained beyond his sentence. Those consequences were explicitly adverted to by his Honour in his judgment in relation to the making of the interim continuing detention order and were implicit in his references to the “unusual circumstances of this case” in his judgment in relation to the final continuing detention order. [107]-[108].

Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant appeals against a continuing detention order made pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) by Button J on 16 July 2015: State of New South Wales v Davie (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 935 (Davie (No 2)). The order made in Davie (No 2) was for a term of 12 months and will expire on 15 July 2016.
	
	
	An appeal to this Court against the making of a continuing detention order is available by right within 28 days from the date on which the decision was made, or by leave thereafter: s 22 of the Act. A summons seeking leave to appeal was filed in this Court on 29 October 2015, more than three months after the order was made. It followed that leave was required to appeal. Leave was not opposed and was granted, and for that reason Mr Davie will be referred to as the appellant in these reasons. An order was also made, with the consent of the State, permitting the appellant to rely on further amended grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The matter came on for hearing before this Court on 8 April 2016. On that day, orders were made extending time to appeal but dismissing the appeal. The Court indicated that it would give its reasons on a later date.
	
	
	We note that by the time this matter came on for hearing in this Court there were just over three months left before the continuing detention order expired. No application had been made to expedite the matter or to otherwise inform the Court that the matter was attended by some urgency. Although, as recorded on 8 April the Court was grateful for the assistance of counsel at the hearing, this placed a considerable burden on the Court in determining the appeal with more than the usual expedition in the interests of justice, including the interests of the appellant. In that regard, we note that the delay would have had particularly serious consequences had the appeal been upheld.
	


The appellant’s background and criminal history


	
	The following background, which is uncontroversial, is principally derived from the findings of the primary judge in State of New South Wales v Davie [2015] NSWSC 413 (Davie (No 1)) at [1]-[8].
	
	
	The appellant was born in October 1968 and is now 47 years of age. It appears that he was introduced to sexual activity at the age of 8 by another young boy, who subsequently introduced him to two adults who sexually assaulted him. He was again sexually assaulted when aged 14 years.
	
	
	The appellant has been found guilty of sexual offences against young boys on three occasions. On the first, in 1984, at the age of 16 years, he pleaded guilty in the Children’s Court to an offence of indecent assault of a six-year-old boy. He admitted to having handcuffed the victim to a fence and to performing oral sex on him. He was admonished and discharged, with the Magistrate asking that he receive treatment from a doctor. He did not seek treatment.
	
	
	In 1992, the appellant pleaded guilty to, or had taken into account on what was then a “Form 2”, a total of 32 sexual offences committed against 9 boys between 1985 and 1992. Some of the offences involved penile/anal intercourse with a four-year-old boy. Many of the victims were known to the appellant through his work as a babysitter and for various community organisations such as the Boy Scouts. Many involved a degree of planning. The appellant took photographs of some of his crimes, which led to the authorities being alerted by an employee of a film development service.
	
	
	On that occasion, the appellant was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, to expire on 18 August 2000. However, the appellant was not released to parole until March 2003. His sentence expired on 18 August 2004. The appellant did not reoffend while on parole, during which period it appears that he was under the continual supervision of his mother.
	
	
	The third occasion related to offences committed in May 2005. The appellant, while attending a social function organised by the State Emergency Service, persuaded a nine-year-old boy, who was in the company of his mother, to accompany him to the men’s toilets. The appellant performed oral sex on the victim and committed other sexual offences. It appears that the appellant continues to deny his guilt in relation to these offences. However, the Crown case, which was based on immediate complaint by the victim, the victim’s demeanour when leaving the toilets and the finding of saliva matching the DNA profile of the appellant on the underpants of the victim, was said by the primary judge in this matter to be “very close to overwhelming”: Davie (No 1) at [8].
	
	
	For the 2005 offences the appellant was sentenced to a period of incarceration of ten years, with a non-parole period of six years. The appellant was not granted parole. The head sentence expired on 26 May 2015.
	
	
	On 20 March 2015, the State commenced proceedings seeking interim and final continuing detention orders or, in the alternative, interim and final supervision orders under the Act. An interim continuing detention order was made by the primary judge on 14 April 2015, pursuant to s 18A of the Act, for a period of 28 days commencing on the expiry of the appellant’s sentence on 26 May 2015: Davie (No 1). The interim order was subsequently extended to 18 July 2015. His Honour also made orders for the appointment of Drs O’Dea and Ellis, psychiatrists, pursuant to s 15(4) of the Act. On 16 July 2015, his Honour made the continuing detention order now subject to appeal.
	


Legislative framework


	
	The Long Title to the Act provides, relevantly, that it is an “Act to provide for the supervision and detention of high risk sex offenders”.
	
	
	The primary object of the Act, as stated in s 3(1), is relevantly:
	


“… to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders … so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.”


	
	Section 3(2) provides that another object of the Act is to encourage such offenders to “undertake rehabilitation”.
	
	
	Part 1A prescribes the persons against whom an extended supervision order or a continuing detention order may be made. Section 5B provides as follows:
	


“5B High risk sex offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a “high risk sex offender” if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	If a person is a high risk sex offender, the Supreme Court may, on application under the Act, make an extended supervision order: s 5C.
	
	
	Section 5D, the provision with which this case is principally concerned, provides for the making of a continuing detention order as follows:
	


“5D Continuing detention orders for high risk sex offenders

(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under this Act, make an order for the detention of an offender if the offender is a high risk sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.

(2) An order made under this section is a “continuing detention order”.

(3) A continuing detention order made under this section may also be referred to as a “high risk sex offender continuing detention order”.”


	
	Part 2, Div 1 of the Act specifies the requirements for making an application for an extended supervision order. There was no dispute that those requirements were met.
	
	
	Part 2, Div 2 governs the determination of an application for an extended supervision order. Section 9(1) provides that the Supreme Court may determine an application for such an order by making the order or by dismissing the application. Section 9(3) provides for a range of matters to which the Court must have regard in determining the application, in addition to any other matters that it considers relevant. Those matters are relevantly identical to those listed in s 17(4) with regard to the making of a continuing detention order.
	
	
	Part 3 of the Act deals with the making of continuing detention orders. There is again no dispute that the requirements of Part 3, Div 1 were met.
	
	
	The determination of an application for a continuing detention order is governed by Part 3, Div 2. Section 17(1) provides that the Supreme Court may determine an application for a continuing detention order by making an extended supervision order, making a continuing detention order, or dismissing the application. Section 17(4) provides for a range of matters to which the Court must have regard in determining the application. Those matters are, relevantly, as follows:
	


“(a)   the safety of the community,

(b)    the reports received from the persons appointed under section 15 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c)   the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d)    the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1)    any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e)   any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f)    the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an interim supervision order or an extended supervision order,

(g)    the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 ,

(h)    the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1)   the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i)    any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender continuing detention order)…”


	
	Section 21 provides that proceedings under the Act are civil proceedings.
	


Reasons of the primary judge

Davie (No 1)


	
	The appellant raised no challenge to Davie (No 1), in which interim orders for the appellant’s detention were made. However, to avoid repetition, his Honour’s judgment was expressly incorporated into Davie (No 2): at [8]. In that circumstance, his Honour can be taken, in the making of the orders in Davie (No 2), to have turned his mind to any relevant factors to which he expressly adverted in Davie (No 1).
	
	
	In Davie (No 1), at [12], his Honour noted that while in custody the appellant had engaged in two preparatory treatment programs which were not focussed with specificity upon sexual offending and, for a number of months in 1999, in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Program (CUBIT), a program for sex offenders. However, his Honour found that he had been discharged from that program due to his lack of commitment to it. At [14], his Honour assessed the appellant as “basically untreated in custody, as a result of his own attitudes.” He also assessed the appellant as:
	


“… lacking all but the most superficial insight into the gravity of his offending, and the inevitability of it having inflicted very deep and long-standing psychological injury upon many children.”


	
	In his reasons for ordering the interim continuing detention order as opposed to an interim supervision order, his Honour observed, at [36], that:
	


“… it is noteworthy that the evidence does not suggest that the [appellant] would be able to be supervised 24 hours a day, or anything like it… Regrettably, the [appellant] has shown himself in the past to be adept at finding ways to have access to children in order to sexually assault them. He was able to complete the [2005] offences at the social function in a matter of minutes. I am well satisfied that, whether acting in a premeditated or opportunistic way, the [appellant] could inflict great damage upon a child in a similar period of time in the future, and he could do so even if subject to a very rigorous [interim supervision order].”


	
	At [37], his Honour noted that he had “reflected carefully on the significance of detaining a citizen in custody even after a lengthy sentence has fully expired.”
	
	
	His Honour concluded on the question of interim orders at [38], as follows:
	


“My final analysis may be summarised as follows. In short, since November 1984, over 30 years ago, the defendant has committed very serious sexual offences against children. Those offences have been both premeditated and opportunistic. He has been undeterred by stern sentences so far. He has not been successfully treated; to the contrary, there is a real question whether he even accepts the immense wrongfulness of what he has done. In the unusual circumstances of this case, I consider that nothing less than an [interim detention order] is appropriate.”

Davie (No 2)


	
	In order to understand the nature of the appellant’s challenge to the continuing detention order made by the primary judge on 16 July 2015, it will be necessary to outline his Honour’s reasons in Davie (No 2) in some detail. In doing so, it will be convenient to identify those findings which were subject to specific challenge on appeal and those which were not.
	
	
	His Honour outlined the new evidence before him on the final hearing at [10]-[60]. Of particular relevance to the matters in dispute on the appeal were the reports made pursuant to s 15(4) of the Act by Dr Ellis and Dr O’Dea, forensic psychiatrists, on 20 and 27 May 2015 respectively, and an affidavit of Ms Donaldson, a psychologist employed by Corrective Services, made on 18 June 2015. That evidence, and his Honour’s findings in relation to it, are examined in more detail below.
	
	
	His Honour commenced his determination of whether to make an order under the Act, and if so, what order, at [85], by outlining the factors that he was required by s 17(4) of the Act to take into account.
	
	
	At [87], his Honour considered that the safety of the community powerfully argued in favour of an order being made: s 17(4)(a). In respect of the factors specified in s 17(4)(b)-(d), which relate principally to expert reports and assessments, his Honour considered at [91] that:
	


“… all of those expert opinions are thoroughly consistent with the view to which one inevitably comes on the evidence as a whole: the risk of this untreated paedophile committing a serious sex offence against a child in the future, especially if not medicated to reduce his libido, is very high.”

That finding was not challenged on appeal.


	
	At [92], his Honour noted that, under an extended supervision order, the appellant would be closely managed in the community: s 17(4)(d1). However, at [93] his Honour held that:
	


“… I maintain the view, expressed in my preliminary judgment, that there is a very significant risk that, even if subject to a stringent [extended supervision order], the defendant could commit serious sex offences against a child within a matter of minutes. He has done exactly that at least twice in the past; the second occasion was a matter of days before he was last at liberty. And the commission of such offences may require only a deviation of a matter of metres from an approved path: for example, in order to lure a child into public toilets at a railway station. Such a deviation may not even be able to be detected electronically, let alone prevented.”


	
	A similar finding was made at [98], in his Honour’s consideration of the appellant’s criminal history pursuant to s 17(4)(h). That history was held to be “very adverse”. 
	
	
	At [94], his Honour held that:
	


“In the unusual circumstances of this case, I do not consider that the defendant can be reasonably and practically managed in the community at this stage.”


	
	His Honour dealt with s 17(4)(e)-(g) as follows:
	


“95   I maintain the position that the therapy that the defendant has received with regard to his chronic condition is, at the most, very incomplete: s 17(4)(e).

96   It is true, and in favour of the defendant, that in the past he has succeeded on parole: s 17(4)(f).

97   Whilst on parole, the defendant was subject to the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW). A charge against the defendant of failing to comply with a reporting obligation was dismissed. The State placed no other evidence of breach before me: s 17(4)(g).”


	
	His Honour considered, at [99], that the views of the sentencing courts did not directly speak against the appellant’s release: s 17(4)(h1).
	
	
	Finally, his Honour considered that other information, including such matters as the attitude of the appellant to the 2005 offences, militated in favour of making a continuing detention order: at s 17(4)(i).
	
	
	At [102], his Honour expressly maintained his conclusion at [38] in Davie (No 1), extracted above at [28]. He held that the evidence before him was more adverse than that which had been available at the preliminary hearing. That finding was made for the following reasons:
	


“103   First, two highly qualified forensic psychiatrists have spoken of a risk of serious sexual reoffending that is, at the least, high.

104   Secondly, the defendant has been frank enough to admit that he still engages in sexual fantasies about young boys.

105   Thirdly, the defendant has expressed his intransigence with regard to therapy in custody.

106   Fourthly, it is now clear that no appropriate psychological or psychiatric therapy is available to the defendant in the community.

107   Fifthly and finally, the defendant has expressed no real willingness to be subject to a regime of anti-libidinal medication, a regime that each psychiatrist regards as virtually essential to him abstaining from reoffending.”

The appellant, in his argument in respect of ground 2, particularly challenged his Honour’s fourth reason and contended that the fifth was incomplete.


	
	At [108], his Honour held that he was satisfied that the test in s 5B(2) was made out (with the effect that the appellant was a “high risk sex offender”). That finding was not challenged.
	
	
	At [109], his Honour held as follows:
	


“In the circumstances of this case, there is no question of me exercising any discretion to decline to make a [continuing detention order] or an [extended supervision order]. I shall not tarry to repeat the evidence that leads me to that view: it is the same evidence that persuades me that the central test is made out.”

His Honour’s findings in [109] were not challenged. However, a question arose as to whether they were sufficient to ground the proper exercise of the discretion to order a continuing detention order.


	
	At [110], his Honour held that he was “well satisfied that an [extended supervision order] would not provide adequate supervision of the [appellant].” His Honour gave two reasons for that finding. First, at [111], he considered that while the appellant had succeeded on parole, in that period he was under the “virtually continuous” supervision of his mother, and he re-offended a matter of months later. Secondly, in a passage subject to particular challenge in the argument in respect of ground 1, he held at [112]:
	


“I do not consider that even the very rigorous regime of conditional liberty that is proposed by the State will adequately protect the community from the defendant taking the opportunity to reoffend against young boys. As I have emphasised, in the past the defendant has been able to commit serious sex offences against children even when their parents are present. I do not believe that an [extended supervision order] in its current form, even accepting the rigour of its conditions and the intention of the authorities to enforce those conditions rigorously, can sufficiently protect the community against the defendant offending in such a way again.”


	
	At [113], his Honour held as follows:
	


“All tests for the making of the CDO having been satisfied, I propose to make the more restrictive order.”


	
	At [118], his Honour determined that he would impose a continuing detention order for a period of 12 months. That period was not the subject of challenge in this Court.
	
	
	His Honour refused to make an extended supervision order to commence on the expiry of the continuing detention order. His reason for that refusal, given at [119], was as follows:
	


“… it is because, as things currently stand, I regret to say that I have no satisfaction that the [appellant] should be released to conditional liberty. That is because I believe that it is very likely that, if released, he will commit a serious sex offence against a young boy. In those circumstances, I am not prepared to order his release to an [extended supervision order] on the evidence before me, whether that release be now or in 12 months’ time.”

That finding was subject to challenge, albeit for the first time in oral hearing in this Court.

Evidence

Report of Dr O’Dea


	
	Dr O’Dea’s report was made on the basis of an interview with the appellant conducted on 7 May 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the appellant’s attitude to anti-libidinal medication, Dr O’Dea reported that:
	


“When I asked him whether he would consider taking medication to assist in managing his sexuality, he said, “… as far as medications goes … no … I don’t believe in them … what happens if it wears off … or I get used to the dosage … how do I know that taking these things won’t re trigger these things ... I know the psychologists are against these things ... I know I can do it without these interventions …” (ellipsis in original)


	
	As to whether the appellant would consider engaging in psychological treatments in the community, Dr O’Dea reported that he said:
	


“… no problems … as long as it’s one to one … because I don’t want others to know about it if I don’t have to … I probably wouldn’t engage in psychological treatments … if I’ve got problems I know there are services available …” (ellipsis in original)


	
	Dr O’Dea made the following assessment:
	


“As a number of [the appellant’s] sex offences, including the index sex offences, were committed against previously unknown male children, in public settings, and when the children were being supervised by a parent, it would seem appropriate that [the appellant] would require to be compliant with an adequate dose of the anti-libidinal medication … and with a structured and supervised community management program, such as set out in the report dated 24 February 2015, prepared by Rebecca Kaye …

Indeed, I do not consider that [the appellant’s] risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the long term, including of committing a further serious sex offence ... would be adequately and appropriately managed at this stage in the community without successful implementation of the above psychiatric treatment and risk management program, including successful prescription of anti-libidinal medication, together with a structured and supervised community management program.

However, further time in custody, at the present time, even with [the appellant’s] participation in psychological sex offender programs in custody during that time, is unlikely to significantly reduce this risk on his subsequent release from custody.”


	
	The primary judge considered Dr O’Dea’s report at [23] ff. His Honour stated at [30] that the defendant had “indicated [to Dr O’Dea] that he would not consent to take” anti-libidinal medication. He then recorded the appellant’s comments to Dr O’Dea in relation to anti-libidinal medication, that “I don’t believe in them” and “I know I can do it without these interventions”. He also recorded appellant’s comments that he was prepared to engage in individual psychological therapy in the community and that he “probably wouldn’t engage in psychological treatments”.
	
	
	His Honour, at [42], summarised Dr O’Dea’s opinion in the following terms:
	


“…if released to the community, the [appellant] should be consulting a suitably qualified and experienced forensic psychiatrist, and that a central component of his psychiatric treatment and risk management would need to be anti-libidinal medication”.

Report of Dr Ellis


	
	Dr Ellis’ report was made on the basis of an interview with the appellant on 10 May 2015.
	
	
	In relation to the appellant’s attitude to anti-libidinal medication, Dr Ellis stated that:
	


“The decision to take antilibidinal medication is one for the informed competent patient. The assessment did not include a detailed discussion of potential risks and benefits of medication, however canvassed the option in general terms. He stated that he would consider medication as an option after a full medical evaluation.”


	
	Dr Ellis noted that anti-libidinal medication could be administered by tablet or long-acting injection, and that compliance could be monitored by measuring serum testosterone.
	
	
	Dr Ellis subsequently commented that:
	


“It would be recommended [the appellant] be referred to a forensic psychiatrist for assessment for antilibidinal medication. This would be the method most useful in reducing risk derived from sexually deviant arousal. Even should he not agree to this treatment now, should he show signs of relapse during supervision the issue could be revisited with him.”


	
	The appellant told Dr Ellis that he was “prepared to do one-on-one psychological counselling in the community.” Dr Ellis gave the following opinion on treatment outcomes in custody as compared to those in the community:
	


“The evidence for psychological treatment in community settings is more promising than for custody, presumably as the psychological gains made are able to be tested in a real setting, and exposure to criminal peers is reduced. There is no indication extended incarceration reduces offending on release.

In this case with the significant monitoring that can be in place with an extended supervision order, including restrictions on accommodation … and restrictions on associating with vulnerable persons the theoretical benefits of further incarceration in order to gain a theoretical benefit from psychological treatment would be outweighed by the potential greater gains in risk reduction in a structured community setting. If antilibidinal medication were used as part of treatment, then further risk reduction is likely.”


	
	His Honour commenced his consideration of Dr Ellis’s report at [43]. His Honour observed at [54] that, in conformity with Dr O’Dea, Dr Ellis placed emphasis on anti-libidinal medication as being the best treatment to address deviant arousal on the part of the appellant. At [57] his Honour further noted that Dr Ellis had stated that the question of medication was one for the “informed consent of a patient” and that the appellant had told Dr Ellis that he would “consider medication” as an option but only after a full medical evaluation.
	


Affidavit of Megan Donaldson dated 18 June 2015


	
	Ms Donaldson is a registered psychologist employed by Corrective Services. She gave evidence that Corrective Services provides treatment specific to sex offending in the community through Forensic Psychology Services (FPS). The appellant, having been assessed as a high risk offender, was not eligible for Community-based Treatment, a group therapy program provided through FPS. However, Ms Donaldson noted that the appellant would be eligible for risk management sessions provided by FPS if he consented to them and an extended supervision order was made.
	
	
	Ms Donaldson assessed the FPS risk management sessions as follows:
	


“Risk management aims to address the risk behaviours by implementing alternate behavioural strategies to manage high risk situations. This differs from custody-based intensive treatment such as CUBIT, which provides treatment or intensive therapy aimed to reduce risk over the longer term by addressing dynamic or criminogenic factors, which are related to risk.

…

I am not aware of any empirical research on the efficacy of risk management sessions in the community.

In my view, the risk management approach in the community is less intensive than programs offered in custody due to the absence of a “therapeutic community” and reduced frequency of treatment or groups. The [appellant] has been assessed as a high risk offender who would benefit from high intensity treatment. It is my opinion that the level of intensity and nature of risk management sessions may not adequately address the [appellant’s] level of risk and treatment needs.”

Proposed conditions of extended supervision order


	
	It is not necessary to set out in full the conditions of the proposed supervision order. The following conditions, however, were directly relevant to the appellant’s attack on his Honour’s reasoning:
	


“Part A: Reporting and Monitoring Obligations

Reporting and Monitoring Generally

1. The [appellant] must accept the supervision of Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW) until the end of the Order.

2. The [appellant] must report to the Department Supervising Officer (DSO) or any other person supervising him as directed by the DSO.

3. The [appellant] must follow all reasonable directions by his DSO or any other person supervising him.

…

Part L: Medical intervention and treatment

49. The [appellant] must notify his DSO of the identity and address of any healthcare practitioner that he consults.

50. The [appellant] must attend all psychological and psychiatric assessments, therapy, support and treatment that his DSO tells him to attend.

51. The [appellant] must take all medications that are prescribed to him by his healthcare practitioners, including any anti-libidinal medication.

52. If the [appellant] knowingly ceases to take medication that has been prescribed, either on a temporary or permanent basis, the [appellant] is to notify the DSO within 24 hours of ceasing to take the medication.

53. The [appellant] must agree to his healthcare practitioners sharing information including reports on his progress and information he has told them with each other and with his DSO.

54. The defendant must agree to any information being shared between those agencies that are involved in his supervision including, but not limited, his DSO and CSNSW.”

Grounds of appeal


	
	The appellant’s Further Amended Grounds of Appeal were as follows:
	


“GROUND 1

His Honour erred in finding that he was not satisfied pursuant to s 5D(1) of [the Act] that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order including:

(a)    His Honour failed to consider key elements of the reports of Dr Ellis and Dr O’Dea, persons appointed under section 15(4) to conduct an examination of the appellant;

(b)    His Honour failed to consider that there were psychological or psychiatric therapy and risk management strategies available to the appellant in the community;

(c)    His Honour failed to consider the significance and effect of conditions 49 to 54 of the proposed extended supervision order.

GROUND 2

His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in making an order for a continuing detention order including that:

(a)    His Honour failed to consider that even if satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order, he had a discretionary power not to make a continuing detention order;

(b)    His Honour failed to consider whether the making of a continuing detention order was likely to discourage the appellant to undertake further rehabilitation or impede that rehabilitation;

(c)    His Honour failed to consider, as part of the exercise of that discretion, the serious consequences for the appellant as a result of his being detained beyond his sentence.”


	
	At the outset of the hearing in this Court, the appellant conceded that grounds 1(c) and 2(b) of the further amended grounds were not argued before Button J. However, he submitted that those grounds did not represent entirely new arguments but rather were refinements of existing arguments. Leave was granted at the hearing to rely on the amended grounds.
	


Submissions – ground 1


	
	The appellant’s overall submission in relation to ground 1 was that because sufficient treatment was available to the appellant in the community, and because safeguards would be in place under an extended supervision order if he refused to engage with that treatment, “adequate supervision” of the appellant would be provided if he was released subject to a supervision order. In that regard, he emphasised that “adequate supervision” in s 5D(1) was not anchored to the concept of “unacceptable risk” in s 5D(2): State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [74]-[75]. He also submitted that “adequate supervision” did not mean watertight supervision: Attorney-General (Qld) v Francis [2006] QCA 324.
	


Submissions – ground 1(a)


	
	In respect of ground 1(a), the appellant submitted that the primary judge erred in failing to consider that both Dr Ellis and Dr O’Dea considered that there was adequate protection for the community if an extended supervision order was made, provided the appellant received appropriate therapy and took anti-libidinal medication.
	
	
	The appellant accepted as correct the primary judge’s finding at [107] that the use of anti-libidinal medication was virtually essential to the appellant abstaining from reoffending. When pressed, he also accepted that the appellant had expressed “no real willingness” to be subject to that medication. However, he contended that his Honour’s finding was incomplete and that the evidence of the appellant as to his attitude towards anti-libidinal medication was ambiguous.
	
	
	The appellant contended that the report of Dr O’Dea extracted above at [49] was in this respect unclear, as it did not contain an express statement by the appellant that he would not consent to take anti-libidinal medication. The appellant also contended that the primary judge erred by finding otherwise at [30]. The appellant also placed some reliance on his statement, recorded in the report of Dr Ellis set out above at [53], that he would consider medication as an option after a full medical evaluation.
	
	
	Further, the appellant contended that the question of whether he would provide informed consent had not yet arisen, as the appellant had not yet been referred to a doctor for consideration of suitability for anti-libidinal medication: State of New South Wales v Atkins [2014] NSWSC 292 at [117].
	


Submissions – ground 1(b)   


	
	The principal submission in respect of ground 1(b) was that his Honour erred in finding at [106] that “no appropriate psychological or psychiatric therapy is available to the defendant in the community.” That error was said to feed into the crucial finding in [112] that an extended supervision order would not adequately protect the community.
	
	
	The dispute on this issue principally turned on the primary judge’s treatment of the evidence of Ms Donaldson, and whether the risk management sessions which she indicated would be available to the appellant on release to supervision amounted to appropriate therapy. The appellant contended that it was and that it would reduce the appellant’s risk of reoffending. That contention was advanced by way of the reinforcement of a further submission that the primary judge failed to have proper regard to the general opinion of Dr Ellis to the effect that treatment in the community was more effective than treatment in custody.
	


Submissions – ground 1(c)


	
	By ground 1(c), the appellant contended that even if he had not yet demonstrated any real willingness to take anti-libidinal medications, that was not material having regard to the proposed extended supervision order. This was because, although he could not be forced to take the medication, the regime under the proposed order had the effect that, if the Department Supervising Officer was not satisfied that the appellant was taking anti-libidinal medication, an urgent application could be brought for a further interim order under the Act. On the appellant’s construction of the conditions of the proposed order, the regime provided for the sharing of information such that the authorities would be made aware of the appellant’s treatment or lack thereof.
	
	
	This approach was, according to the appellant, effectively that taken in Atkins. In that case, Johnson J, in making an extended supervision order, proceeded on the basis that informed consent to anti-libidinal medication would be given when the occasion for it arose: at [118], and it was considered relevant that the State could seek further orders if consent was in fact refused: at [121].
	
	
	The State submitted that all of the primary judge’s findings were open to him and that his judgment accurately reflected the expert evidence. It contended that Atkins is not authority for the proposition that the correct approach, in cases in which anti-libidinal medication is a central issue, is to put the offender on an extended supervision order to allow them time to give informed consent. Rather, the outcome in Atkins reflected an analysis of the particular circumstances of that case.
	


Consideration – ground 1


	
	In the Court’s opinion, no error has been disclosed in the primary judge’s reasons.
	
	
	The error identified by ground 1 was a failure to consider three specific relevant considerations: namely, key elements of the reports of the psychiatric experts; the fact of there being available psychological treatment strategies available in the community; and the significance and effect of certain conditions of the proposed extended supervision order. In essence, however, each of these matters was directed to the adequacy of supervision in the community.
	
	
	As the Court has already given detailed consideration to the primary judge’s reasons and the parties’ submissions in respect of them, we can state our reasons for rejecting this ground of appeal in fairly short order. In doing so, we bear in mind the established principle that, provided a primary decision maker has considered a relevant matter in coming to a determination, the question of the weight or importance to attach to that matter is, subject to limited exceptions, a matter for the decision maker.
	
	
	Section 17(4) of the Act prescribes the matters the Supreme Court must take into account in determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order. These matters include “the reports received from the persons appointed under s 15(4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination”: s 17(4)(b). Dr O’Dea and Dr Ellis were appointed under s 15(4) to conduct examinations of the appellant. The Act thus prescribed that regard was to be had to their reports. As this Court stated recently in Anderson v State of New Sales Wales [2016] NSWCA 86 at [65], it is the contents of such reports which are relevant.
	
	
	In Davie (No 2), the primary judge, at [23] ff and [43] ff respectively considered the evidence in the reports of Dr O’Dea and Dr Ellis. We have made brief reference to his Honour’s consideration of that evidence and have set out the relevant portions of those reports above. We are satisfied that his Honour correctly summarised the evidence of each of these psychiatric experts. At [30], his Honour appropriately made express reference to that part of Dr O’Dea’s report as to the appellant’s attitude to taking anti-libidinal medication. His characterisation of the overall effect of Dr O’Dea’s report as being that the appellant would not consent was reasonable given the negative tenor of the appellant’s statements recorded by Dr O’Dea.
	
	
	His Honour’s understanding was reinforced by the appellant’s submission to the primary judge that “the ultimate position of Mr Davie is this… Mr Davie doesn’t believe that the behaviour of anyone, let alone himself, ought to be controlled by medication”. The appellant’s position before his Honour was therefore both emphatic and unambiguous. His Honour also referred, at [57], to the appellant’s more qualified approach to taking such medication as indicated to Dr Ellis.
	
	
	It follows that in our opinion, his Honour had regard to the contents of each of the psychiatric reports.
	
	
	Ground 1(b) of the appeal related to his Honour’s alleged failure to consider that there were psychological or psychiatric therapy and risk management strategies available to the appellant in the community. The availability of such therapy and strategies was the subject of Ms Donaldson’s affidavit, which was considered by his Honour at [18] ff. At [21], his Honour noted that the risk management sessions that could be provided to the appellant in the community by the Forensic Psychology Services were not therapeutic in nature. Having regard to Ms Donaldson’s statement extracted above at [59], we consider that that finding was open to his Honour. It followed that, as his Honour found at [106], no appropriate psychological or psychiatric therapy was available to the appellant in the community. There is therefore no basis for the assertion in ground 1(b).
	
	
	Much of the appellant’s argument on the appeal was directed his contention in respect of ground 1(c) that his Honour failed to consider the significance and effect of conditions 49 to 54 of the proposed extended supervision order, which related to the requirements and conditions imposed upon the appellant in respect of medical intervention and treatment. Insofar as the conditions overall were concerned, his Honour recognised that they imposed a “very rigorous regime of conditional liberty”: at [112].
	
	
	Although his Honour did not give separate consideration to conditions 49 to 54, that is readily explained by the fact that his Honour had already determined that it was clear that there was no appropriate psychological or psychiatric therapy available to the defendant in the community: see at [106]; and that he had expressed no real willingness to be subject to a regime of anti-libidinal medication, that both Drs O’Dea and Ellis had considered was virtually essential: see at [107]. It will be remembered in this regard that according to Dr Ellis, such medication could only be prescribed on the basis of informed consent by the patient, in this case the appellant; that the closest the appellant came to indicating a willingness to consent to taking such medication was after a relevant medical assessment for that purpose; and that no such assessment has ever been carried out. In those circumstances, the appellant’s attitude to taking such medication, on the evidence before his Honour, was at the best, ambivalent and, as we have already indicated, his position before his Honour was emphatic that he should not be required to take such medication.
	
	
	Accordingly, it is not to the point to say that his Honour failed to consider the conditions proposed for any extended supervision order which required the appellant to attend psychological and psychiatric treatment and take such medication as was prescribed including any anti-libidinal medication, when the basis for each of the conditions to operate were simply not in play on the evidence before his Honour.
	
	
	Nor do we accept the appellant’s submission that the approach taken by Johnson J in Atkins indicated the appropriate way in which the Court should approach all matters in which anti-libidinal medication is a factor.
	
	
	The defendant in that case was aged 59 and was illiterate. He had been assessed as having a mild intellectual disability with an intelligence rating in the mildly retarded range, in the lowest two per cent of the population. Like the appellant in the present case, he had been convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and had not undertaken any relevant treatment in custody, although the applicant’s sexual offending was far more extensive than that of the defendant in Atkins.
	
	
	At the time that Johnson J in Atkins was considering the State’s application for a continuing detention order under the Act, the defendant had been released into the community on the conditions imposed by an interim supervision order. The defendant had been compliant with those conditions.
	
	
	The State in Atkins pressed the court to make a continuing detention order on the basis that it would not be satisfied that adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order. Particular emphasis was placed upon the expert evidence of the need for the defendant to be treated with anti-libidinal medication. An assessment of the defendant’s suitability for that treatment had not been undertaken, but, on the evidence before his Honour, could be undertaken during the course of supervision if an extended supervision order was made.
	
	
	Johnson J considered, at [118], that there was a proper foundation in the evidence that any conditions of an extended supervision order include the use of anti-libidinal medication and that it was highly desirable that the defendant’s suitability for such treatment be assessed as soon as possible. His Honour noted, however, that the defendant could not be compelled to take such medication against his will: State of New South Wales v Cruse (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 128 at [105].
	
	
	Importantly, having regard to the appellant’s submission in this case, Johnson J considered at [121] that if the defendant in Atkins declined to give his informed consent to taking anti-libidinal medication and that was considered to be a critical aspect of his risk management in the community under an extended supervision order, the State could approach the court pursuant to s 13B on the basis that circumstances had altered since the making of such an order such that adequate supervision could not be provided under an extended supervision order.
	
	
	Atkins must be considered having regard to its own facts. The facts in that case are different from the facts proven in this case. The making of a particular order in that case does not prescribe the orders that must be made in another.
	
	
	Ground 1 of the appeal is rejected.
	


Submissions – ground 2


	
	The appellant’s contention in relation to ground 2(a) was that, having determined not to make an extended supervision order, his Honour failed to consider separately the exercise of his discretion whether or not to make a continuing detention order. There was no dispute that that residual discretion did require separate consideration: Donovan at [14]-[15]. In this regard, while Donovan considered the provisions of the Act relating to high risk violent offenders, there is no relevant distinction to be drawn with those provisions presently under consideration relating to high risk sex offenders.
	
	
	As noted above, his Honour found at [109] that there was no question of exercising the discretion to decline to make either a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order. The appellant contended that that did not demonstrate that he had separately considered the discretion whether or not to make a continuing detention order. Rather, as we understand the submission, the appellant contended that [109] followed, without further consideration, from the effective finding in [108] that the appellant posed an “unacceptable risk” and was therefore a “high risk sex offender”.
	
	
	On the appellant’s contention, the primary judge went on to determine that an extended supervision order would be insufficient, such that the requirements of s 5D(1) were made out: at [110]-[112], and then to conclude, at [113], that he would therefore make a continuing detention order, without independently considering his discretion as to whether to decline to do so.
	
	
	The State submitted that the primary judge’s reasons at [109]-[113], properly understood, did indicate that he had considered the residual discretion to decline to make an order. It contended that there was no requirement for him to expressly state the negative proposition that he was declining to exercise his discretion to decline to make an order.
	
	
	The appellant further contended that, having failed to consider the separate discretion conferred by s 5D, his Honour failed to consider two relevant considerations which went to that discretion. The first was that the making of a continuing detention order as opposed to an extended supervision order would have a negative effect on the appellant’s rehabilitation: ground 2(b). The importance of that consideration was said to flow both from the ‘other object’ of the Act being rehabilitation: s 3(2), and also from the primary object, the protection of the community, in the sense that the appellant would presumably eventually be released and, for the protection of the community, would need to be rehabilitated by that time. The second consideration was the effect of the continuing detention order on the appellant’s right to liberty: ground 2(c).
	
	
	In oral argument, the appellant accepted that he could not be successful in ground 2 unless he was successful in his challenge to the primary judge’s reasons at [119], where his Honour held that, if released, the appellant would very likely reoffend. This was because in those circumstances, even if the trial judge otherwise erred, this Court, in the re-exercise of the discretion, could reach no different conclusion. He further contended that the finding in [119] related to no statutory test and was not consistent with the expert evidence.
	
	
	The State contended that, while he had challenged the finding in [119], the appellant had not challenged the trial judge’s findings at [91], [93] and [98], which it submitted underlay the finding in [119]: see above at [32]-[34]. The appellant, in response, contended the finding in [119] went beyond the findings in the three earlier paragraphs. In particular, he contended that the finding in [91] was relevant only if the appellant went untreated and that the findings in [93] and [98] related only to whether the appellant could reoffend, not whether he would.
	


Consideration – ground 2


	
	In the Court’s opinion, ground 2 should be rejected.
	
	
	We do not accept the appellant’s argument, in ground 2(a), that his Honour simply proceeded from his finding at [108] that the appellant was a “high risk sex offender” within the meaning of s 5B(2) to a determination, at [109]-[113], that a continuing detention order be made without giving any consideration to whether, in the exercise of his discretion, he ought not make such an order. It is apparent from his Honour’s reasons at [109], both that he understood that there was a discretion not to make an order at all and that he concluded that this was not a case where he would not make an order. The reasons for not exercising the discretion in that manner, were, as his Honour stated, the same as those that caused him to determine that the appellant was a serious sex offender. The fact that the reasons were the same does not invite, let alone require, the conclusion that his Honour did not separately consider the exercise of the discretion.
	
	
	Further, in the hearing below, the primary judge asked counsel for the appellant if she wished to be heard against the discretion to make one or other of the available orders under the Act. Counsel replied that she did not. We consider that the absence of detailed reasons in respect of whether the discretion ought not to be exercised must be understood in that context.
	
	
	By ground 2(b), the appellant contended that his Honour failed to have regard to the appellant’s rehabilitation in determining whether to make an order under the Act and what order to make. It was submitted that, rehabilitation being an object of the legislation, his Honour was required to take it into account.
	
	
	In dealing with this ground of appeal, it can be noted at the outset that the appellant accepted that the evidence did not establish that his rehabilitation would be impeded if a continuing detention order was made. Rather, he argued that the appellant’s rehabilitation would be enhanced by the making of an extended supervision order.
	
	
	It should also be noted at the outset that the extent to which the question of the appellant’s rehabilitation was in issue in the court below is debatable. During the course of argument before the primary judge, after referring to rehabilitation as being a subsidiary purpose of the Act, his Honour received a negative response from counsel for the appellant to the question:
	


“… I am not being called upon to determine, in a direct sense, what setting in the community or custody, or the community under a very strict [extended supervision order], would best promote Mr Davies rehabilitation … am I?”


	
	In his reasons, his Honour did not expressly discuss the question of rehabilitation. Nonetheless, the whole purpose of his Honour considering the evidence of what psychiatric and other treatment, including anti-libidinal medication, the appellant needed was directed to what his needs were to control his offending behaviour. The control of offending behaviour relates to a person’s rehabilitation as much as it does to the protection of the community.
	
	
	Accordingly, and having regard to the manner in which the case was run at first instance, we do not consider that the appellant has established that there was any error in his Honour having failed to make express reference to the appellant’s rehabilitation.
	
	
	By ground 2(c), the appellant contended that his Honour failed to consider the serious consequences for the appellant of being detained beyond his sentence. This aspect of the appellant’s challenge can be disposed of immediately. His Honour at [37] of Davie (No 1) stated:
	


“I have reflected carefully on the significance of detaining a citizen in custody even after a lengthy sentence has fully expired. I have also reflected carefully upon whether an [interim supervision order] subject to the conditions proposed would suffice to fulfil the purposes of the Act in this case.”


	
	His Honour then, in both Davie (No 1) at [38] and in Davie (No 2) at [94], referred to the “unusual circumstances of this case”. It is clear, from the context of his Honour’s overall remarks that those unusual circumstances included what he saw as the particularly strong risk of re-offending posed by the appellant and that those circumstances justified the very serious step of keeping the appellant in custody beyond the period of the sentence that was imposed rather than make an extended supervision order.
	
	
	Finally, we consider that there is merit in the State’s submission that a challenge to his Honour’s reasons at [119] was unsustainable in the absence of any challenge to [91], [93] and [98]. But in any event, this was a case where the evidence justified making a continuing detention order.
	


Conclusion


	
	The foregoing are the reasons for the making of orders by the Court on 8 April 2016 that leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed. It only remains to note that, in accordance with s 23 of the Act, it was appropriate that no order for costs be made in this matter.

		03 May 2016",2016-05-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2701686,Lee v Regina [2016] NSWCCA 66,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 17 October 2014 the applicant, Hoe Fatt Lee, was sentenced by Frearson SC DCJ on three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, being offences under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicant received an aggregate sentence involving a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months and an overall sentence of 11 years. At the time of sentencing, the applicant was 60 years of age and will be almost 70 by the date of expiration of his sentence. Each of the offences involved the applicant fellating a young man he had picked up at a public place, who was incapacitated as a result of inebriation.
	
	
	The offences were undoubtedly serious and the punishment imposed sufficiently severe to warrant a grant of leave to appeal and careful consideration by this Court. In that task, it was not greatly assisted by counsel appearing for the applicant. The Court’s task was, however, significantly assisted by counsel for the respondent.
	
	
	The circumstances of the offending and the matters raised on behalf of the applicant are explained in the reasons of McCallum J with which, subject to the following observations, I agree.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence of 11 years consisted of a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months and an additional term of 3 years 6 months. In imposing the aggregate sentence, the judge indicated that, had separate sentences been imposed, the non-parole periods with respect to counts 1 and 3 would each have been 5 years 4 months with an additional term of 2 years 8 months giving, in each case, a sentence of 8 years. The indicative sentence for the second count was slightly less, involving a non-parole period of 5 years 2 months, an additional term of 2 years 7 months and an overall sentence of 7 years 9 months.
	
	
	These figures demonstrate that a reasonably high proportion of the individual terms (had they been imposed as such) would have been served concurrently, with a reasonably low proportion of accumulation. As the offences involved were entirely separate, both in terms of time and identity of victim, the judge was careful to avoid the imposition of an unduly severe overall sentence on a man of the applicant’s age.
	
	
	The reasonableness of the outcome must also be judged against four further considerations, namely that (a) the statutory guidelines involved a maximum penalty for each offence of 14 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years; (b) previous offending was of a kind sufficient to deprive the applicant of a significant element of possible leniency; (c) the objective gravity of the offending was characterised by the sentencing judge as in the mid-range, thus giving weight to the specified standard non-parole period and, (d) having gone to trial and been convicted, the applicant did not obtain the benefit of a reduction of his sentence on account of an early plea.
	
	
	For reasons given by McCallum J, I agree that there was no substance in any of the specific grounds of appeal, which leaves for consideration only the ground of a manifestly excessive sentence (ground 1) and the challenge to the characterisation of the offending (ground 4). It is convenient to deal with the latter first.
	


Objective gravity of offending


	
	The applicant faced a number of hurdles with respect to this challenge. First and foremost, it has long been accepted that assessing the objective seriousness of the offending is “quintessentially” an evaluative exercise to be undertaken by the sentencing judge: Mulato v Regina. [1]  In this sense, it is similar to the exercise of a discretionary power, with respect to which this Court will be slow to intervene.
	
	
	The applicant faced a further difficulty in this regard, namely that the sentencing judge, having conducted the trial at which both the victims and the accused gave evidence, was in a far better position than this Court to judge the objective gravity of the offending. That would be so even if this Court had a transcript of the evidence at trial, which it does not have.
	
	
	There are two factors which may militate against a finding of objective gravity of the offending in the mid-range. First, it was open to him to argue that oral sex committed by the offender should generally be considered less culpable than penetrative sex committed by the offender. (Such a submission cannot be precluded by statements in cases, referred to below, that kinds of sexual intercourse should not be abstractly ranked in hierarchical order: the submission will be made in a specific context.) Secondly, although the applicant took advantage of the victims in circumstances where, as the jury found, it must have been obvious to him that they were in no state to resist (or, for that matter, consent) he had not been responsible for the conduct which resulted in them being in such a condition.
	
	
	While these factors carry some weight, they do not provide a basis, in the circumstances of this case, for rejecting the characterisation of the offending as being in the mid-range.
	


Manifest excess


	
	There remains a question as to whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. There are three factors which might support such a conclusion. First, according to the sentencing statistics available for this State, the non-parole periods for the indicative sentences were undoubtedly at the high end of the range. Thus, of 133 cases involving non-parole periods for non-consecutive terms, between April 2008 and March 2016, only six offenders received higher sentences. With respect to the terms of sentences, again only six offenders received higher sentences and, taking the category of consecutive and non-consecutive terms (211 cases) only 16 offenders received higher sentences. However, these figures did not distinguish between those who had pleaded guilty and those who had gone to trial. Furthermore, the sentences were relatively evenly spread between two years and 10 years, reflecting the variety of the seriousness of the offending and, no doubt, the subjective circumstances of the offenders.
	
	
	If there were more useful statistics available, they were not provided to the Court. All that can be said on the basis of this information is that the sentences indicated as appropriate in relation to the individual offences committed by the applicant were towards the top of the range, assessed with respect to the severity of the sentences, whereas the objective gravity of his offending was characterised as mid-range.
	
	
	Secondly, the sentencing judge was presented with a table of sentences imposed over the years, most of which involved oral sex by male offenders with both male and female victims. At least one case pre-dated the enactment of standard non-parole periods and hence should be disregarded. The sentencing judge stated that he had not found the other cases very helpful, in part because the sample was relatively small. However, he did make express reference to Greenwood v Regina, [2]  which was in fact the case involving the highest individual sentence. There the trial judge had imposed a sentence of 4 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months; the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the offender’s appeal.
	
	
	The victim in Greenwood was an 18 year old woman, who had become inebriated to the point of losing consciousness. Whilst alone with her in a car, the offender removed her clothing and engaged in cunnilingus. In imposing the sentence, the trial judge had noted that “while the offences did not involve force, coercion or violence (largely because the victim was unconscious) they were nevertheless serious because of that very vulnerability – a vulnerability of which the applicant was aware and of which he took full advantage.” [3]  The offence was characterised as below the mid-range for an offence of that kind. The offender had favourable personal circumstances (a number of offences for physical violence apparently being related to the breakup of his marriage) and had “good prospects of rehabilitation.” [4]  There was no evidence of remorse; the occasion would be the first period of imprisonment. While the Court reiterated statements that the nature of the sexual intercourse is not to be considered in isolation and then “ranked in some form of hierarchy” there is no reason to suppose that an offence involving penile penetration could not have been considered more serious.
	
	
	Noting the penalty imposed in Greenwood, the trial judge in the present case remarked that, “I do not consider that to be particularly helpful and I do consider a sentence of that magnitude generally to be manifestly inadequate.” Having regard to the fact that there was no suggestion supportive of that view in the reasoning of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the case might have been treated as an indication of a sentence which was not outside an appropriate range. However, on the basis that the present offending could properly be characterised as within the mid-range, there was nothing in Greenwood which demonstrated that a non-parole period which was approximately one-third greater would be manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Apart from the conventional description of the standard non-parole period as a guideline to the sentencing judge, there must be a real question as to whether an error of principle can be demonstrated in circumstances where the indicative sentences for each offence are about 75% of the standard non-parole period and (a) their objective gravity was characterised as mid-range, (b) the offender was convicted after a trial, with no discount available for a plea, (c) the offender had a prior criminal record which deprived him of any claim to leniency on that account and (d) his personal circumstances were not such as to warrant leniency.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having regard to the various factors set out above, I agree with McCallum J that the sentencing process did not miscarry. I also agree that there should be a grant of leave to appeal against sentence, but that the appeal should be dismissed.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: Hoe Fatt Lee seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court after he was found guilty by a jury of three counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for each offence was a term of imprisonment for 14 years. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applied to each offence: s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), item 7 of the Table.
	
	
	Instead of imposing a separate sentence for each offence, the judge imposed an aggregate sentence, as allowed under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The sentence was a term of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years and a balance of term of 3½ years. The sentence was fixed to commence on 12 February 2013 (the date on which the applicant was arrested) and expires on 11 February 2024. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole after the expiration of the non-parole period on 11 August 2020.
	
	
	The offences were committed against different men on different dates but had common features. Each victim was a young man in a state of extreme intoxication. In each case, the applicant approached the victim at Central railway station late at night and offered him a lift home. In each case, the applicant then drove the victim to a more secluded place and performed fellatio on him while the victim was either unconscious or barely aware of what was happening.
	
	
	The first offence was committed in April 2009. The victim in that case had been celebrating the mid-semester break from university and had consumed a large amount of alcohol. At about 1 am he found himself at Central railway station. He was so intoxicated that he was losing his balance and throwing up. The applicant approached him and offered him a lift, saying that he was going in the same direction as the victim.
	
	
	When he was dropped off at his house, the victim found his fly undone. His penis was in significant pain and his foreskin had been rolled back, prompting him to seek medical attention (and, presumably, to report the matter to police).
	
	
	The second offence occurred in December 2010. The victim was an electrician from Sweden on a working holiday. He had been drinking at a barbeque and later at a bar near Central. After going to the bathroom at the bar, the next thing he recalls is waking up in a car with a man (the applicant) “going down” on him.
	
	
	The third offence was committed in February 2012. The victim was another tourist. He had been drinking at the Rocks for a number of hours and began to feel strange and incapacitated. He walked to a train station and recalls sitting up against a wall before everything went black. His next recollection was of waking up in a car in the back seat with his trousers down and the applicant performing oral sex on him.
	
	
	The evidence at the trial is not before this Court. According to the transcript of the proceedings on sentence, the applicant was charged with the offences on the strength of a “cold case” DNA match. The sentencing judgment records that the applicant gave evidence at trial that none of the victims was intoxicated and that each was awake and was a willing participant in the sexual intercourse in question. The jury’s verdicts reject that account.
	
	
	The judge considered each of the offences to be within the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour accepted a submission put by the Crown that the two later offences should be regarded as more serious being the second and third offence respectively. Separately, however, his Honour noted the aggravating factor of the first offence that the victim had sustained an injury to his penis, albeit one the judge evidently accepted had been inflicted inadvertently.
	
	
	As required by s 53A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the judge indicated the sentences that would have been imposed had an aggregate sentence not been imposed. The indicative sentences were:
	



	
	for the first and third offences, imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of five years and four months and a balance of term of two years and eight months;
	
	
	for the second offence, imprisonment for seven years and nine months with a non-parole period of five years and two months and a balance of term of two years and seven months.
	



	
	The applicant had prior convictions relating to offences committed in 1998, namely three acts of indecency with a person under 16, one offence of stalking and an aggravated indecent assault. The facts relating to those convictions were before the sentencing judge in the present matter.
	
	
	In summary, the applicant made several approaches to a 13 year old boy over several weeks as the boy walked through a park on his way to school. On the first occasion the applicant showed the boy pornographic magazines and explained them to him. On a later occasion he showed the boy a condom with an instruction sheet and explained the instructions. On a third occasion he again showed the boy the pornographic magazines, put his arm around him and touched him on his genital area through his school pants. The boy was by this time very frightened of the applicant and had been trying to avoid him. The stalking charge related to three further occasions when the applicant attempted to approach the boy. After the matter was reported police kept the boy under surveillance; they arrested the applicant after a further attempted approach. On that occasion he was carrying a backpack containing eight pornographic magazines, condoms with an instruction sheet and tissues.
	
	
	The applicant also had a conviction for offensive behaviour in 2008 but there was no reliable account of the facts of that offence before the sentencing judge. It appears to have related to an incident in a public toilet. The judge did not rely on the criminal record as an aggravating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings) Act but considered that the record deprived the applicant of any entitlement to leniency.
	
	
	A pre-sentence report prepared for the purpose of the present matters recorded that the applicant agreed with the facts but “denied knowledge that it was an offence to perform sexual acts on a person that was unconscious as a result of being heavily intoxicated”. Those remarks echo the position adopted by the applicant in respect of the 1998 matters as recorded in the pre-sentence report prepared for those proceedings, which stated that the applicant was co-operative during the preparation of the report but that “it seemed that he minimised his offending behaviour by indicating that he did not know that it was a serious offence to show materials; contraceptive aids and magazines that would aid in the boy’s sexual education”.
	
	
	The applicant’s claimed ignorance of the criminality of his conduct in the present matters rings hollow in that context. It is also in tension with his evidence in the trial to the effect the victims were conscious and willing participants in the sexual intercourse. The judge considered that the material revealed a “history of self-justification and a history of minimising the conduct”.
	
	
	The applicant relies on six specific alleged errors as well as a ground that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. It is appropriate to deal first with the specific errors alleged.
	
	
	Ground 2 is that the judge erred in:
	


“finding ‘a systematic exploitation of intoxicated young men’ and ‘on the prowl’ and ‘systematic and calculated’” (as written).


	
	It is appropriate to consider the relevant passage in full. The judge said:
	


It is said that these were spontaneous offences. They were part of a systematic exploitation of intoxicated young men who were essentially helpless. The offender was on the prowl, seeking out young men to fellate regardless of consent and whatever view one takes of it these are serious examples of the offences contrary to this particular section. There was a calculated sexual exploitation of the vulnerable. I appreciate that I need to consider the discrete sentences in each case but the course of conduct to some extent does inform the degree of deliberation and determination. As I said these were systematic and calculated, each victim was degraded and humiliated.


	
	The complaint made by ground 2 appears to be that it was not open to the sentencing judge to describe the applicant’s conduct as being “systematic” or “calculated”. The only submission put to support that ground was the observation that each offence was separated by period of about 18 months. It was submitted on that basis that the offences were accordingly not “systematic” but at most “opportunistic exploitation” of drunken men.
	
	
	The findings complained of expressly responded to a submission put below that the offences were spontaneous. Even if each individual offence entailed a measure of spontaneity or opportunism, there was a pattern of offending revealing a degree of calculation that was plainly relevant to the sentencing task. In my view, the similarities between the three offences afforded support for the judge’s findings. Ground 2 should be rejected.
	
	
	Grounds 3 and 4 are that the judge erred in:
	


“finding they are ‘serious examples of the offences contrary to this section’.

finding the offences were in the mid-range of objective seriousness”.


	
	The applicant sought to support those grounds by listing a series of features absent from his offending. He submitted that the offences were not serious examples of offences against s 61I, and did not fall in the mid-range of seriousness of that offence, because there was no penetration of the complainants’ bodies or the leaving of semen; there was limited appreciation by the complainants of what had happened to them (due to their states of intoxication); the state of intoxication of each victim was not due to any action on the part of the applicant and there was no physical force or violence or fraud or threats made.
	
	
	As submitted by the Crown, it does not follow from the fact that an offence under s 61I can involve more serious features not present in the applicant’s offending that the offences were below mid-range. The judge correctly observed that the assessment of the seriousness of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. This Court has frequently observed that that is an assessment which is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. In Mulato v R, [5]  Simpson J, as her Honour then was, agreeing “most emphatically” at [45]-[46]:
	


Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.


	
	Justice Simpson’s separate judgment emphasised the importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge “not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses” but “because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system.” Her Honour said “each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance”.
	
	
	Whilst I would respectfully agree with those remarks, the evaluation of the evidence is an additional consideration militating against interference in this case. The sentencing judge presided over the trial and heard the evidence of the victims and the applicant. None of that material is before this Court.
	
	
	The factors listed by the applicant as being absent from his offending do not, in my view, mandate the conclusion that the offences were below mid-range. I do not think the act of fellatio can be said to be intrinsically less serious than a sexual assault involving penetration. This Court has held that it is wrong to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in a hierarchy for the purpose of determining their objective seriousness: Doe v R. [6]  As Bellew J said, the objective seriousness of such offences is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. A similar approach may be taken in relation to non-consensual acts, where the victim is an adult who temporarily lacks the ability to consent.
	
	
	The sentencing judge in the present case gave careful consideration to the facts and circumstances of the offences including the nature of the intercourse (fellatio), the vulnerability of each victim and the degradation and humiliation to which each was subjected. In my view, as submitted by the Crown, it was well open to the judge to describe the offences as “serious examples of the offences contrary to this particular section” and to find that the offences were in the mid-range of objective seriousness. Grounds 3 and 4 should be rejected.
	
	
	Grounds 5, 6 and 7 were addressed together by the applicant. They are that the judge erred in:
	


“paying insufficient weight to the appellant’s risk of re-offending and finding against the weight of the evidence without explaining rejection.”

“Paying insufficient weight to the appellant’s evidence of character and remorse”.

Finding the appellant ‘I do not consider that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and I cannot conclude he is unlikely to re-offend’ ignoring the evidence before him and not it explaining it’s (sic) rejection” (as written).


	
	Those grounds are entirely without merit. The applicant argues, in substance, that the sentencing judge was obliged to accept the pre-sentence report, which provided an actuarial risk assessment assessing the applicant as “a low risk of offending”, and the opinion of a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Neilssen, that the applicant is “at low risk of re-offending”.
	
	
	The judge felt unable to make a finding one way or the other as to the likelihood that the applicant would re-offend. As already noted, the circumstances of the applicant’s earlier offending and his failure to acknowledge the criminality of his recent offending (set out above) were before the sentencing judge. In that context, the judge said:
	


In my view the offender continues to minimise his conduct and I do not consider that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation on the evidence and I cannot conclude that he is unlikely to reoffend on the evidence; I just do not know one way or the other”.


	
	In his discussion of that issue the judge expressly acknowledged Dr Neilssen’s opinion that the applicant is “at low risk of re-offending”. Although the judge did not expressly refer to it, there was material before his Honour which revealed that the applicant gave a much-diluted account of his earlier offending to Dr Neilssen, as follows:
	


Mr Lee said that he had a criminal conviction from about fifteen years ago from showing a young man a pornographic magazine, for which he received a community service order. He said that the young person told a school teacher and he was identified and arrested the following day”.


	
	In fact, the material before the sentencing judge (not available to Dr Neilsson) revealed that the applicant approached the boy many times over several weeks; that on one occasion he touched the boy’s genital area and that he was convicted of four offences including stalking.
	
	
	The judge did not make a positive finding that the applicant was likely to reoffend. He observed, unexceptionably, that the applicant’s likelihood of reoffending “will depend on whether he embraces some of the programmes and whether they can effect some type of change in his behaviour”. The judge was not obliged to make a finding in the exact language of Dr Neilssen’s opinion. There was no error in his approach. Grounds 5, 6 and 7 must be rejected.
	
	
	I return to ground 1, which is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In addition to the specific submissions made in support of the other grounds, this ground rested primarily on a consideration of the sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission. The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed in the present case is “higher than all of those in the statistics”. That submission was based on a misconception; it compared the aggregate sentence imposed in the present case with sentences imposed for individual offences in the statistics. Comparing the sentences indicated for each individual offence in the present case with the statistics, the indicative sentences in the present case were within the range of those recorded in the statistics but certainly toward the top of that statistical range. As noted by the Crown, the statistics are of limited assistance, since they do not identify the aggravating or mitigating factors of the offences dealt with.
	
	
	The applicant observed (without any helpful analysis or even a citation for the decision) that the sentence imposed on him was “longer than the Hey Dad star Robert Hughes who was convicted of 10 charges with complainants aged between 7 and 15, was in a position of trust and received a sentence of 10 years 9 months and a non-parole period of 6 years”. The comparison is unhelpful. As submitted by the Crown, it involved offending of a different nature giving rise to different charges with different, lower maximum penalties and was determined under a different, more lenient sentencing regime: Hughes v R. [7] 
	
	
	The Crown referred to a number of decisions with which more pertinent comparison can be made. Of those, perhaps the most relevant is the decision of this Court in Ewen v R, [8]  the complainant in that case had gone to a person’s house with a view to choosing a puppy. The afternoon developed into something of an impromptu party and she became intoxicated by drugs and alcohol. The facts of the offence were summarised by Simpson J as follows:
	


During the evening, others came and went…a cousin of the complainant arrived sometime between 10.00pm and 11.00pm. Amphetamines were produced and consumed. The group sat around a table in the back yard. The complainant continued to drink the bourbon. She had become moderately affected by the alcohol. Sometime after midnight, [another woman] borrowed the complainant’s telephone. Not long after that, the appellant and another man arrived and joined the party. A little later the complainant was preparing to leave. The appellant, who was standing in the doorway of a bathroom, invited her to join him, saying that he had something to show her. He ushered her into the bathroom, shut the door, pushed her head down and forced her to perform fellatio upon him. The complainant lost consciousness for a time. When she recovered, she was lying on the floor, partly undressed. The appellant was behind her, having penile/vaginal intercourse. The complainant told the appellant that he was hurting her and asked him to get off her. He left the room. 


	
	The appellant in that case was sentenced for other matters in addition to the two sexual assaults. On the first count of sexual intercourse without consent the judge imposed a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 2 years. On the second count of sexual intercourse without consent, his Honour imposed a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 4 years accumulated by 1 year on the earlier sentence.
	
	
	The Court rejected an appeal against sentence. One of the grounds relied upon was that the severity of the sentences did not reflect the judge’s findings that the offences were of mid-range objective gravity. Rejecting that ground, Simpson J confined herself to the following observation (at [232]): “the maximum sentence applicable is imprisonment for 14 years. The standard non-parole period of 7 years is a relevant guidepost”: Muldrock v The Queen. [9] 
	
	
	To the extent that the statistics are helpful, they suggest that the aggregate sentence imposed in the present case was stern. However, I have not been persuaded that it was excessive to the extent of revealing latent error. The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with McCallum J and with the additional remarks of Basten JA.

		29 April 2016",2016-04-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701693,R v Pratten (No 25) [2016] NSWSC 539,"remarks on sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 9 September 2015, the offender, Timothy Charles Pratten, was found guilty of seven offences of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”). Each offence relates to the understating of income each financial year from 2003 to 2009 (being the year ending 30 June in each such year).
	
	
	The Jury verdict of 9 September 2015 was the result of a retrial in circumstances where the offender had been convicted in a first trial of each of the seven counts, which first conviction occurred on 13 June 2012. The sentence in relation to those proceedings was delayed by a collateral attack on the jurisdiction of the Court arising from alleged invalid acts of various Commonwealth officers, being those concerned with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police and an allegation as to a constitutional prohibition on the Court dealing with financial advantage resulting from the understating of income tax.
	
	
	As a result of that collateral attack and an appeal therefrom, the first sentencing was delayed. The appeal was withdrawn by the offender in mid-December 2013, but the Court, as presently constituted, was not informed of that withdrawal. After making its own inquiries, the Court ascertained that the appeal had been withdrawn and sentence was passed on 31 March 2014.
	
	
	The first convictions and the sentences were the subject of appeals. Those appeals were successful and the retrial eventuated. Following the retrial and conviction, proceedings occurred on sentence and the first assigned sentence date was abandoned due to the illness of the Court as presently constituted.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, there has been a regrettable delay in the passing of sentence on the offender. While, in some senses, the offender may have benefited, in that he was able to attend to certain personal issues that arose, that delay must be taken into account to his credit, as these matters have been hanging over his head for some significant period.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the first substantial delay was caused by the investigation and finalisation of the case against the offender, the second delay between the first conviction and the passing of sentence was mostly caused by the offender himself, and the last delay from the time at which sentence was first imposed (31 March 2014) until today has been caused by errors made in the original trial, for which the offender is not responsible, and the unavailability of the Court.
	
	
	I take into account the entire period since the charging of the offender as a period during which the offender has been the subject of bail under conditions. While some of that time has been caused directly or indirectly by the collateral challenge to the original charges, during the whole of the period since 2010 the offender has been subject to bail (except for the 99 days during which he has been in prison) and I also take that period on bail into account in fixing an appropriate period of incarceration. I add that any account of the delay cannot lead to a sentence that is not, in all of the circumstances, appropriate.
	
	
	Moreover, given that the offender was sentenced at the end of March 2014, there is a prima facie position that the result of any resentencing process on retrial should not impose a sentence greater than the sentence imposed after the first trial. That prima facie position is displaced only on rare occasions, when the evidence is substantially different or the first sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	It seems to me, even in those circumstances, if a more severe sentence were to be imposed on retrial, it should be at the lowest possible level within the range of appropriate sentences that may be available. Indeed, given all of the circumstances related to this offender, it seems to me that the Court should impose a sentence at the lowest end of the range appropriate for the offence.
	
	
	In order to determine an appropriate sentence, given those qualifications, the Court is required to look at the objective seriousness of the offence committed and the subjective circumstances of the offender. Before doing so, it is necessary to restate some well-known principles of sentencing.
	


Principles of Sentencing


	
	In this case, because the offences are Commonwealth offences, the sentence must be imposed according to the regime prescribed by Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”) and the commencement point for such a task is, in accordance with s 16A(1) of the Act, to impose a “sentence of severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the case”. This includes the proposition that a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed only where the Court is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all of the circumstances: s 17A(1) of the Act. Reasons for the passing of a custodial sentence are required: s 17A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	In assessing the sentence to be imposed, the Court is required to take into account, relevantly, the following matters: the nature and circumstances of the offence; the course of conduct in circumstances where the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character; the degree to which the person has shown remorse or contrition and, in particular, whether the offender has taken action to make reparations; the degree to which the offender has cooperated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence; deterrence, both specific and general; adequate punishment; the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender; the prospects of rehabilitation; and the probable effect that any sentence would have on the offender’s family or dependants: s 16A(2) of the Act.
	
	
	Most of the foregoing criteria are factors that are taken into account in any sentencing exercise. The principles of sentencing are well-known. In white-collar crimes, particularly those involving fraud, more than most, general deterrence plays a significant role. Such crimes are generally not committed on the spur of the moment, but are planned and embarked upon after weighing advantages and disadvantages. As a consequence, the question of general deterrence becomes far more relevant in sentencing for a crime or crimes such as those now before the Court.
	
	
	Sentencing is an intuitive process, involving the resolution of goals that often point in different directions and may often conflict. Those goals include the protection of society, the deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. Some of the goals overlap. None of them can be considered in isolation from any other: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476. Because of the need to resolve these purposes, which, to some extent, at least, point in different directions, the sentencing process must remain intuitive.
	


Objective Seriousness


	
	It is necessary to set out the facts surrounding the offences. As has been stated a number of times, the Crown bears the onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt each of the matters upon which it relies at sentencing, as it did at the trial.
	
	
	On the other hand, matters that are relied upon by the offender can be proved to the satisfaction of the Court on the lower standard of the balance of probabilities. The task of a sentencing judge, in the position in which the Court now finds itself, is to find all of the facts associated with the offending conduct, except that the Court does not have open to it a finding which is inconsistent with the verdict of the Jury.
	
	
	Thus, the Jury verdict forecloses any finding that the elements of each offence have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, but apart from the minimum necessary to prove each offence, the Court is required to find the degree of culpability of the offender’s conduct.
	
	
	In a case such as this, where the Crown put its case on guilt of the offender on the basis that the Jury needed only be satisfied of a single amount of ordinary income that was not declared in each income year, the degree of fact finding on sentence is significant.
	
	
	The Jury was required to be unanimous on at least one item of income. In order to find guilt, the Jury was required to arrive at a unanimous finding in relation to such item of income and a finding beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	As a consequence, the Court is required to find most, if not all, of the facts that were in dispute except dishonesty, deception and some financial advantage.
	
	
	In this task, the Court is greatly assisted by admissions made formally under s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995 by the then accused at or near the commencement of the trial. The Court takes account of the co-operation of the offender in the conduct of the trial to his credit on sentence.
	
	
	The offender was a Director of Rural & General Insurance Limited at all or most relevant periods during which it was operating. The shareholding of Rural & General Insurance Limited was held or controlled by Griffith Narrandera Primary Property Developments Limited (“GNPPD”).
	
	
	GNPPD was owned by the offender (50% of the Class A shares) with the other 50% of the Class A shares being held by D’Artagnan Investments International Limited, which also held 100% of the Class C shares. D’Artagnan Investments was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.
	
	
	Further, in relation to GNPPD, there were Class H shares, 100% of which were owned by 71 Cowper Street Holdings Pty Limited. 71 Cowper Street Holdings was a company owned and operated by the offender who was, at all relevant times, the sole Director and the sole shareholder. The offender was a Director of GNPPD.
	
	
	Rural & General Insurance Limited was incorporated in Australia and carried on the business of an insurance company, underwriting insurance risks and issuing contracts of insurance (policies).
	
	
	As a result of legislative changes associated with some instability in the insurance industry, particularly the collapse of HIH Insurance, the Australian Government legislated to increase the requirements on insurance companies operating in Australia, which conditions Rural & General Insurance Limited could not meet. Those changes occurred in or about 2002.
	
	
	From 1 July 2002, Rural & General Insurance Limited ceased issuing insurance policies and Rural & General Insurance Limited has been under external administration since 18 February 2004. The scheme that was established to overcome the requirements of the new legislative regime was that a broking company, Rural & General Insurance Broking (“the Broking Company”), was established by utilisation of a pre-existing company that changed its name on 15 August 2002. The pre-existing company was first registered on 26 June 2000.
	
	
	The Broking Company, as the name suggests, acted as an insurance broker in Australia and all of the fees received for policies (or most of them) were transferred to Vanuatu and remitted to accounts of the Vanuatu International Trust Company Limited (“VITCO”) from 2 October 2002 to 1 June 2004 and to International Finance Trust Company Limited (“IFTCO”) from 15 June 2004 to 26 July 2009. VITCO and IFTCO operated different accounts at different periods, but those account details, to the extent they are known, are irrelevant for present purposes.
	
	
	A company was established in Vanuatu originally under the name Rural & General International Insurance Limited and from March 2005 under the name Commercial Pacific Insurance Limited (“CPI”). Regardless of the name change, this remained the same company and the Court will refer to it as CPI.
	
	
	As is clear from the documentation before the Court, one of the advantages in incorporating as a foreign company in Vanuatu is the secrecy provisions permitted under the applicable law and the tax regime and requirements that are extremely beneficial to foreign entities.
	
	
	CPI was registered in Vanuatu as an exempt insurer and therefore operated under the beneficial scheme, some of the benefits of which I have just outlined. CPI was incorporated in Vanuatu on 20 August 2002.
	
	
	On 23 August 2002, the Broking Company entered into an Insurance Agency Agreement with CPI, whereby CPI underwrote insurance policies that were sold to retail customers in Australia by the Broking Company. As a result of that agreement, the Broking Company remitted premiums collected from customers to CPI. Those moneys were paid into VITCO and IFTCO (the difference being the years in question). During the tax years 2003 through to 2009, the Broking Company remitted $19,049,046 to either VITCO or IFTCO on behalf of CPI.
	
	
	During the same period (i.e. the periods of the charges from the tax year ending 30 June 2003 through to 30 June 2009) payments from VITCO or IFTCO were made either directly into the offender’s St George Bank accounts or to third parties on the direction or instruction of the offender. Those amounts totalled $5,009,732 of which approximately $2,900,000 were direct deposits to the offender’s bank account and $2,100,000 were payments to third parties on the offender’s instructions or directions.
	
	
	It is the foregoing $5,000,000 in transfers from CPI, to either the offender or to third parties at his direction, that the Crown alleged, at trial, was income, in the ordinary meaning of that term, in the hands of the offender, none of which was declared as income, granting to the offender a financial advantage, being the initial reduction in tax liability. Further, the Crown alleged that the offender was aware that the amounts ought to have been included as income and dishonestly, and by deception, obtained the financial advantage from the Commonwealth by understating his income.
	
	
	It is necessary to describe the operation, to the extent that it is known, of VITCO and IFTCO. Each is a trust company operated by a firm of accountants. Each has, presumably, a number of accounts or one account in which a number of clients have an interest, the interest then being recorded by journal entries.
	
	
	During the first trial, there was no evidence that the moneys transferred at the direction of the offender from VITCO and IFTCO were moneys obtained from CPI and the moneys from VITCO and IFTCO in Vanuatu could have been derived from clients other than CPI. It was a reasonable hypothesis, in those circumstances, that the moneys could have been transferred out of accounts held by the offender’s Family Trust or other companies associated with the offender and not CPI.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the terms of the formal admissions under s 184 make it clear (at [51], referring to “the accounts of VITCO and IFTCO” [my emphasis], being a reference back to those accounts at [50]) that the payments to the offender’s personal bank account and to third parties came from the accounts of VITCO and IFTCO on the offender’s instruction, being the accounts into which the $19,000,000 of premiums had been transferred.
	
	
	Those amounts had been transferred for the purpose of completing (or improving) a rural property; the purchase of a hardware establishment; development proposals for a block of land; the purchase of a helicopter; the purchase of a motor vessel (boat); the purchase of other blocks of land; the payment of school fees for the offender’s two daughters; rent at the offender’s private premises; payments for an architect for a proposed development in Vanuatu; payments for a cattle truck; and other incidental payments.
	
	
	Exhibits O and P, written or published in their current form after the date of these offences, set out the advantages associated with being a foreign company operating out of Vanuatu, but not involved in transactions in Vanuatu. As already stated, those advantages include no or minimal tax; total secrecy; total flexibility for meetings, rules and other formalities; and no requirements as to capital backing.
	
	
	CPI (by whatever name then called) was established as a foreign corporation in Vanuatu.
	
	
	The accounting firm, BDO Vanuatu, set up CPI to underwrite the business provided by the Broking Company (Transcript 1141, evidence of the offender). The offender met with the two directors (each a partner at BDO) in Vanuatu prior to 1 July 2002 in relation to the placing of insurance business in the Pacific region. Mr Sinclair, one of those directors, was described by the offender as his “good friend and partner”: Transcript 1163; Exhibit A, Volume 1, p 52.
	
	
	The placing of business with CPI by the Broking Company was accompanied by the transfer of premium payments from 20 August 2002, presumably for the period 1 July 2002 until 20 August 2002. Mr Aaron Stephenson was also a Director in the Broking Company, holding approximately one-third of the interests in the company, while the offender held two-thirds: Exhibit A, p 928; Transcript 1141.
	
	
	The reason BDO set up the insurance company to underwrite the business provided by the Broking Company was that the offender could not move to Vanuatu to set it up himself: Transcript 1141 – 1142.
	
	
	The arrangement was, at least in part, that an Agency Agreement was established under which the Broking Company issued cover notes and insurance policies on behalf of CPI under which the Broking Company was entitled to a commission equal to 33% of the net premium received: Transcript 1144; Exhibit 1, Volume 3, p 940.
	
	
	The risks insured by CPI were reinsured through a London reinsurance broker, Alsford Paige & Gemes: Exhibit A, Volume 3, p 1068H, letter dated 28 September 2008; Transcript 1243.
	
	
	The agent of the reinsurer, Mr Cantwell gave evidence that the offender told him that he had “an interest in” CPI and described it as “mine”. Some criticism was made of the evidence of Mr Cantwell, but in my view the criticism was misdirected.
	
	
	Mr Cantwell does not recall the offender saying he owned CPI but he clearly recalls the offender saying he had an interest in it and referring to it as “mine”. I accept that evidence. However, that evidence is generally insubstantial in terms of the issues in these proceedings.
	
	
	As earlier stated, and as admitted in the formal admissions, the Broking Company remitted premiums to VITCO up until June 2004: Exhibit B.
	
	
	It was from these accounts, according to the formal admissions, that the moneys paid to the offender or at his direction to third parties, derived.
	
	
	After June 2004, this was repeated in relation to the trust account IFTCO, operated by the offender’s new accounting firm PKF Vanuatu. I accept that to some degree there is a “paper trail”, by which I refer to the arguments before the Court during the trial, that the offender and the accounting firms concocted an elaborate subterfuge, the effect of which was to transfer premiums to Vanuatu, which were returned to the offender or entities associated with the offender for the benefit of the offender.
	
	
	The façade is evidenced, at least in part, by the naming of two directors of CPI. Companies called Astrolabe Limited and Astrolabe Nominees Limited were appointed as Directors of CPI. Each of those companies are companies associated with PKF Vanuatu, the new accounting firm, yet, after the event, these two companies were named, ex post facto, as Directors of CPI at a point in time when BDO was CPI’s accountants, namely, in the accounts that refer to the year ending December 2003.
	
	
	As earlier stated, certain assets were acquired, namely a number of properties, a business at Stroud, a farm truck, a boat named “Los Lobos” and expenses were paid, which were the school fees of the offender’s daughters, residential rent on a Darling Point property occupied by the offender and architectural fees, earlier described: Ms Celona’s evidence at Transcript 158 – 160; Exhibit A, Volume 1, p 1; Transcript 381; evidence of the offender at Transcript 1250 and the facts admitted by the offender.
	
	
	There is some question as to some of the earlier payments on which the Crown originally relied but which payments were disavowed by the Crown in its address. These were payments of $436,350 for Skallet Property on 29 July 2002 and transfers of $17,319, $3,319, $472 and $77 all of which occurred before 20 August 2002, when CPI was first incorporated. I accept that these transfers would not, individually, collectively or together with other later transfers, support the offences charged.
	
	
	As for the assets, each was purchased in the name of an entity other than the offender. For example, the helicopter was purchased in the name of Sonarpia Pty Ltd, which is the company that is the trustee of the offender’s Family Trust: Transcript 1191; Exhibit A, Volume 2, p 443, p 254, p 479, p481 and p 482. The Family Trust was a trust for the benefit of the offender and his two daughters. It was a discretionary trust formed in or about May 2003: Transcript 1131.
	
	
	To take another example, it is appropriate to deal with the boat. The boat was originally purchased by the offender and his father, according to the offender’s oral evidence: Transcript 1231. I accept that part of the offender’s evidence.
	
	
	Nevertheless, formal admissions refer to the offender purchasing the boat in January 1997: see [49] of Exhibit 2. In November 2005, the offender ordered a new generator and an invoice issued to the offender, care of the Broking Company in Sydney. IFTCO paid the invoice on 20 January 2006.
	
	
	Likewise IFTCO paid all of the expenses associated with the expenses of the private school fees of the offender’s two daughters. This also was paid at the direction of the offender.
	
	
	Similarly, the formal admissions refer to the purchase of building supply material for the property “Skallet” by “an employee of” the offender. The offender was invoiced and paid $2,000 towards the invoice, the balance was paid out of CPI funds in IFTCO at the direction of the offender.
	
	
	There were dealings with the boat. For reasons which did not become clear, the boat became registered in the name of a BDO nominee company, Global Nominees Limited, and after 2004 a PKF associated company, Astrolabe Services Limited.
	
	
	Nevertheless, in May 2011, the offender asserted he was the beneficial owner of the vessel and, on the evidence before the Court, that remained the position at all times: Exhibit A, Volume 2, p 587; Transcript p 1044, a telephone intercept, in a conversation with Robert Agius of 3 December 2008, the offender refers to the boat as “my boat”. At Transcript 1429, the offender agrees he is referring to Los Lobos as his boat and he is the beneficial owner. Apparently, according to the offender, he always thought he was the owner.
	
	
	The foregoing also brings into play the relationship between Pacific Property Investments (“PPI”), which was incorporated in Vanuatu on 6 March 2001. The inference is irresistible that PPI was, at least to the extent of the properties in its name paid out of moneys from CPI, controlled by the offender. The subterfuge associated with interposing PPI was revealed in the memo from the accountants to the vendor relating to the obtaining of permission from the client, the principal of which was going to be in Vanuatu later in the month. The offender was the principal.
	
	
	The offender sought to deflect this evidence by suggesting that, while it was he, as a person, to whom the accountants were referring, the client was 71 Cowper Street, a company wholly owned by the offender and of which he was the sole Director and through which he owned the Broking Company. The difficulty with that explanation was that it was PPI that was required to give the authority. It was PPI that was the client of the accounting firm and 71 Cowper Street was never a client of the accounting firm. The accounting firm had never given 71 Cowper Street advice. Nor had it performed work for it in any other capacity.
	
	
	The admission by the offender that it was he to whom the memo referred is telling. Given that the memo could not have been referring to 71 Cowper Street and was plainly in its terms referring to PPI, the irrefragable inference is that, at least for the purposes relevant to these proceedings, the offender controlled PPI. And given that Astrolabe Limited and Astrolabe Nominees were the Directors of PPI, the inference necessarily arises that, for the purpose of any decision made in relation to PPI, the offender controlled Astrolabe Limited and Astrolabe Nominees in terms of their decision making.
	
	
	Moreover, the sole directorship of PPI transferred from Global Nominees, a BDO Vanuatu holding company, to Astrolabe and Astrolabe Nominees Limited at the same time that the offender moved accounting firms from BDO Vanuatu to PKF Vanuatu.
	
	
	That brings the Court to the ownership of the properties being Skallet at Tereel Road, Ward’s River, which is the rural property, an adjoining block referred to in the proceedings as the Macedo Block (a rural property adjoining Skallet) and the Stroud development block. Each of those was purchased in the name of PPI: see Exhibit A, Volume 1, p 60; Exhibit A, Volume 2, p 634; Exhibit A, Volume 1, pp 356 – 361 and 377. Again, at least in relation to these properties, the offender controlled PPI.
	
	
	Further, it is clear from the inferences available from the history of the establishment of the respective companies and the evidence as to the attitude of the offender that, at least for the purposes or to the extent of the moneys received by the offender or at his direction, from VITCO and IFTCO, the offender controlled CPI and was entitled to a share of its profits. Certainly, the offender had an interest in CPI.
	
	
	In one of the intercepted telephone conversations between the offender and Mr Greer, his then accountant, on 5 December 2008, the offender gave a truncated history of the establishment of the Vanuatu insurance company, referring at all times to “we” and then to the fact that the Vanuatu insurer had to cease writing business on 30 June 2008 because of further restrictions imposed under Australian law. The offender then said “I don’t want the company now … it’s got no income and it’s going to go exactly the same way as the old RGI company, into run off”: Exhibit N.
	
	
	Further there is the conversation, to which the Court has already referred, with Mr Cantwell in which the offender referred to CPI as “mine” and that he had “an interest in it” (a conversation denied by the offender). I accept Mr Cantwell’s evidence in this respect.
	
	
	On 17 December 2007, in an email to his accountant, the offender stated:
	


“I have a beneficial interest in Commercial Pacific Insurance Limited, which is a Vanuatu registered insurance company. My beneficial interest is that I will receive 25% of the profits of the business after it is wound up and by constitution it has to be within 10 years of its operations, i.e. 2012”: Exhibit A, Volume 3, p 1189; Transcript 554 – 555; and see the exchange at Transcript 1428.


	
	I have already referred to the formal admissions which disclose that the payments from VITCO and IFTCO to the offender and to third parties were the moneys of CPI held by VITCO and IFTCO and were expended at the direction of the offender. The offender, in his evidence, made clear that he understood all of the transfers and the relationship between each of the companies. This was no careless disregard for the separation between corporate bodies. This was a deliberate scheme in which moneys were transferred from Australia to Vanuatu and returned to various accounts controlled by the offender, either directly or indirectly, for his beneficial use.
	
	
	The Jury were instructed that, if they believed the offender that the amounts received from Vanuatu were, to the relevant extent, loans, they were required to acquit the offender. Plainly, given the verdicts, the Jury did not believe the offender. Frankly, nor do I.
	
	
	The amount received from Vanuatu was almost precisely 25% of the amount remitted to Vanuatu by the Broking Company.
	
	
	There were a series of conversations during the periods in question relating to confirmation that the loans were available or for “standard debts” or concerning loans that were made from the profits of CPI. One example is the conversation with Mr Berry on 4 December 2008 in which the offender claimed he had “always borrowed money over there in order to buy things for the farm”. On the same day, the offender expressed his fear to Mr Greer, his accountant, that the authorities would suggest that all moneys that were returned to him personally from Vanuatu were income: Exhibit A, p 1064.
	
	
	In a conversation on that same day, 4 December 2008, with Kelly Fawcett of PKF, the offender asked for a dollar for dollar calculation of what all the loans had been over the years so that if the authorities decided to suggest a lot of it was income the offender would be able to argue that there were deductions available in relation to each such amount: Exhibit A, p 1056; Transcript 1441. There are significant examples in other telephone intercepts.
	
	
	Essentially, the offender argued to the Jury that some of the amounts were the reimbursement of expenses and others were loans. There is evidence before the Court that refers to loans. The provenance of some of that evidence is doubtful.
	
	
	As to the proposition that moneys were paid to reimburse expenses, this is not a matter relied upon by the offender and therefore not required to be proved, even at the lower standard, by the offender. Rather, it is said to be a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with the moneys being income and therefore required to be disproved by the Crown.
	
	
	There are significant difficulties with each of these propositions. Further, it is not clear that it would make any difference to the outcome of the proceedings.
	
	
	I assume for the purposes of the present discussion, without accepting, that the amounts paid were a reimbursement of expenses. If that were the situation, which I doubt, then the amounts received would be required to be shown as income and the expenses deducted. Moreover such an explanation is inconsistent with the explanation given by the offender. The offender maintained, at all times, that the moneys received, or any significant amount received, had been by way of loan. The offender pointed to a number of documents which referred to loans or advances including draft accounts, a draft loan agreement, finalised accounts and emails.
	
	
	The difficulty with that explanation is that the Jury did not believe the offender. That of course does not end the situation. As was explained to the Jury, even if they did not believe the then accused, it did not prove the opposite and it was still for the Crown to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, each of the factual elements necessary for the finding of guilt. In other words, it was not for the then accused to prove that the amounts were loans, it was for the Crown to prove that they were not genuine loans.
	
	
	The evidence discloses an extraordinary vagueness as to the amounts that had been “borrowed” or obtained and an even more vague assessment of whether the amounts would need to be repaid and whether, and if so how much, interest was payable.
	
	
	The remarkable coincidence that the amount returned was almost precisely 25% of the insurance premiums remitted is one of the strands in this cable, rendering the combination of facts proof beyond reasonable doubt. Another is the fact that the moneys have not, in any real sense, been repaid. It is also clear that neither the offender nor anyone on his behalf has any record of the total amount paid at the direction of the offender. The failure of the offender to keep records of the amount he had allegedly borrowed is a matter which, with others, I use to draw the inference that he did not consider, at any stage, that he was under an obligation to repay the moneys advanced or to pay interest on them.
	
	
	Each of the matters to which reference has already been made point starkly to the proposition that the moneys received were not loan moneys. Over and above that vagueness and the unreality of the so-called reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt, are the two documents, given much play in the trial. The first, in time, is the email to the offender’s business partner dated 19 December 2007, generally called the “Crash Email”.
	
	
	The Crash Email was a communication sent at a time when the offender was to travel by helicopter to Vanuatu, being the helicopter purchased and the subject of proceedings. In the email, the offender gives instructions to his business partner in the unfortunate circumstance of an air accident. It tells his business partner: to value the business and take it or sell it; to put the moneys in trust for his daughters; to make payments to his mother for the rest of her life; to make arrangements for the purchase of the business were his partner so minded; to arrange a placement of the old company’s money into the Trust Account; about the sale of the helicopter; and about the sale of the boat, the sale of the property in Stroud and other such amounts.
	
	
	While the terms of such a communication would not, in ordinary circumstances, be expected to be detailed or precise, there is no suggestion in the whole of the email that the full amount of value for the helicopter, the boat, the properties and the like, are not the assets of the offender, or are subject to the repayment of any obligation or loan. Nor is there any direction as to how or from which asset any such loan should be repaid.
	
	
	The second document is a completed financial application sent by email to New Holland Finance on 24 September 2008. That application contained the handwritten note of the assets and liabilities of the offender, written by the offender, alongside each of which is a value. It refers to properties in Paddington and Woolloomooloo; it uses the term ‘nil’ in relation to entries for liabilities owing in respect of properties or bank overdraft or by way of loan. It lists the offender’s total liabilities as “nil personally”.
	
	
	The document also refers to overseas properties and the property in the Hunter Region (a reference inferentially to the rural properties and to Stroud): Exhibit A, Volume 1, p 181; Transcript 1612.
	
	
	There is another aspect to these explanations. If, as might originally have been thought were it not for the evidence otherwise available, the amounts were received by the offender on behalf of the Broking Company, it makes no difference to the offence. If the moneys from Vanuatu were paid to the offender (or at his direction to third parties) on behalf of the Broking Company, for the personal use of the offender, then the amounts received or paid would still be income to the offender. The offender was an employee and office holder of the Broking Company.
	
	
	The Crown has discharged its onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the amounts alleged in its closing address were income and displacing any reasonable hypothesis that moneys were loans.
	
	
	Lastly, the offender raises the reasonable hypothesis said to exist that there would have been deductible items associated with the income then received. It is not immediately apparent how this argument can be sustained. If there were deductible expenses associated with the operation of MyIdaho Farming Operation, for example, or any other business or venture, those expenses would be deductible (and deducted) whether or not the amounts alleged were loans or income.
	
	
	Likewise, if there were expenses associated with the operation of the helicopter or the boat, those expenses may or may not be deductible, depending upon whether the helicopter or boat was used for the intended earning of income or in the operation of a business.
	
	
	If the expenses were of a personal nature and not for a business purpose, then the expenses would not be deductible, regardless of the character of the receipts. If, on the other hand, the expenses were necessarily incurred in earning income, or properly utilised for the purpose of production of the profit of a business or venture, then those expenses would be deductible and were deductible, again regardless of the character of the amounts received as income or loans.
	
	
	Put another way, if a business or person receives a loan, the moneys from which are then used to pay school fees, that expense is not deductible. If the moneys were received as income, rather than as a loan, and were used for the same purpose, those moneys or expenses would still not be deductible.
	
	
	On the other hand, if loan moneys were received and the moneys used for business expenditure, then that expenditure would be deductible, as would the interest on the moneys borrowed. There is no suggestion that any interest was paid or known to be payable in relation to any moneys received by the offender. It is neither probable nor reasonably possible on the evidence before the Court that the offender or his companies did not claim every business expense available.
	
	
	There may be expenses incurred in earning the income found to be derived. Those expenses would be expenses in the administration of the funds in VITCO and IFTCO, including accounting fees. The necessary inference from the evidence before the Court is that those expenses were paid in Vanuatu and were moneys over and above the $5,000,000 received. No reduction is appropriate, probable or reasonably possible.
	
	
	As a consequence of the foregoing, I accept the allegation of the Crown in its entirety as put in its closing address and as submitted during the course of the sentencing proceedings. With the exception of the first five payments in 2002, relating to a period during which it seems the Broking Company was operating but the Vanuatu insurer had not been incorporated, the amounts received and paid for the benefit of the offender are income in the ordinary sense.
	
	
	During the course of these remarks, I have referred to the term income in the ordinary sense. The Crown, in my view appropriately, relied on amounts received which would be income in the ordinary sense of the term, as distinct from any special meaning given to it under the various income tax statutes. On the other hand, it did not rely on income in the ordinary sense that was exempted or excluded from income under the various income tax statutes.
	
	
	Such a course may have had the effect of reducing the amount of income to which these charges relate. Nevertheless, that is the course the Crown undertook. That course was a fairer one; but it may have rendered the offences more difficult to prove and the trial more complicated.
	
	
	Lastly, I comment on the effect of the evidence of the offender. As earlier stated, the offender was required to prove nothing and, even if his evidence were disbelieved, which it is in large measure, if it were to raise a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt, it is material that must be given consideration. I have given it that consideration.
	
	
	The offender’s evidence discloses that the offender was not under any mistaken view as to the operations of companies with which he was associated or with which he dealt. The offender’s evidence also disclosed that the offender set upon a deliberate course of conduct in the expectation that, by returning the moneys and calling them loans, he could escape a considerable amount of income tax. This course was neither accidental nor lacking dishonesty.
	
	
	It is also clear from his evidence that the offender lacks any remorse and was prepared to dissemble and give explanations that he knew to be incorrect in order to avoid the consequences of his conduct. I consider his prospects of rehabilitation poor, as he rationalises his conduct and considers he has done nothing wrong.
	
	
	Further, these offences, committed over a significant period, depend less on the amounts received than on the nature of the criminal conduct in receiving them.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the offender was an instigator of the plan. I am not satisfied, to the requisite standard, that when first initiated, the offender undertook this activity otherwise than on the basis of advice from accountants. I am not, in those circumstances, prepared to accept, in its totality, that particular submission of the Crown.
	
	
	However, when the offender changed accountants in 2004 from BDO Vanuatu to PKF Vanuatu, it is clear from the communications that it was he, not PKF, that explained the workings of the company and the manner in which control was effected. At least from 2004 and in relation to the alteration to PKF Vanuatu, it is clear that the offender was one of the instigators and deliberately set upon a course that continued the planned, deliberate and intended dishonesty.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances, I consider on the evidence before the Court in these proceedings that the conduct of the offender is objectively above the mid-range in seriousness.
	


Subjective Circumstances


	
	I have already mentioned some aspects of subjective circumstances, such as remorse.
	
	
	The offender was born in 1960. Both his parents are deceased. He has one sibling. He was married in 1995 and separated in 2000. At least for some significant period he had custody of his two daughters, whose welfare and state of health were the subject of some evidence and caused some issues during the course of the trial.
	
	
	The delay in imposing a sentence means that each of the daughters is now older and, subject to ill health, capable of living independently. Nevertheless, I accept that the hardship caused to the offender’s two daughters warrants consideration in mitigation of sentence, particularly given the state of health of one of them.
	
	
	I also have updated reports dealing with the offender’s high levels of depression. I accept that the offender will find it difficult to cope in a custodial environment. Most while-collar offenders do, but in his case, he should have regular treatment for his psychiatric/psychological issues. Those issues did not form any part of the reasons for the offending. Nevertheless, they disclose circumstances that would allow the community not to treat him in a manner that it would treat another offender not so afflicted.
	
	
	I assume the tax not initially paid has been. I am aware of the amended assessments and the levying of tax penalties. The penalties are an extra curial punishment, but not for dishonesty or deception which are the gravamen of these offences. Nevertheless, I take some account of that extra curial penalty in setting an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	As earlier stated, the offender has no prior criminal record and is entitled to the leniency associated with a first-time offender.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have found that the objective seriousness of the offences is slightly above the mid-range of offending. The maximum sentence for each offence is 10 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000. There are seven offences.
	
	
	I do not accept that the offences are the product of one course of continuing conduct. It is true that the offences were implemented on three occasions over seven years.
	
	
	It is also accurate to suggest, as did the offender, that, at least to some extent, there is a continuing course of conduct. However, as earlier noted, the conduct differed between 2003 and 2004 on the one hand and 2005 through to 2009 on the other. There was a deliberate change in accountants at which time the offender was the moving party rather than one that may have been following advice.
	
	
	Further, the change in accountants in Australia was occasioned by a communication with his accountant relevant to the possession of an interest in an overseas company. The communication with the accountant, which I do not consider to be wholly innocent in relation to either of them, suggested a course of conduct followed by an exclamation mark, which, while not expressly stating such, did impliedly suggest that Mr Pratten might want to adjust his comments about his overseas interests.
	
	
	Nevertheless, Mr Pratten changed accountants. When he did so, he did not disclose to the new accountants the information that he had disclosed to his immediately past accountant. While there may have been other reasons for the change in accountant, his non-disclosure of his interests in overseas entities was part of his deliberate dishonesty.
	
	
	I am mindful of the delay that has been occasioned in the sentencing, as originally noted. I am also mindful that prima facie the sentence should be no more severe than that originally imposed upon the offender. As earlier stated, there are two exceptions to that prima facie position.
	
	
	In my view, the evidence in this second trial is significantly different from that which was adduced in the first trial. If I am wrong, then I had misunderstood the nature of the evidence adduced in the first trial and the sentence imposed would, if the evidence were the same as that adduced in this trial, be manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	Notwithstanding his severe depression, I still consider that general deterrence is an important element. Given the process of self-assessment, there is a heavier duty on the taxpayer to be honest. Moreover, the practical restrictions that exist in policing every tax return require the Courts to adopt an attitude that deceitful conduct, once discovered, is appropriately punished.
	
	
	As has been said in a number of judgments and earlier in these remarks, in white-collar crime, general deterrence plays a large part. Unlike emotional opportunist offending, white-collar crime is usually premeditated, planned and the result of a balancing exercise by offenders between the advantages to be gained, the chances of apprehension and the disadvantage if caught.
	
	
	Nevertheless, as earlier stated, I take account of the delay. I take account of the offender’s age and lack of prior convictions, the time he has spent on conditional liberty and the time spent on remand and as a sentenced prisoner.
	
	
	I intend to set a sentence that is a full-time custodial sentence, bearing in mind that that is the end result of a consideration that it is the last option to be imposed and only because no other sentence is appropriate. I consider these offences sufficiently serious to warrant full-time custodial sentence. I do not consider specific deterrence to be a significant factor. As earlier stated, I take into account the offender’s health and the effect on his family.
	
	
	In all of the circumstances I intend to impose a sentence for each of Counts 1, 2 and 3 that is wholly concurrent and separate sentences for Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7 each of which should be concurrent with the others but partly cumulative with the sentences for Counts 1, 2, and 3. The sentences for each will take account of the 99 days of imprisonment by adjusting the starting date accordingly and will be set bearing in mind the conditional liberty under which the offender has served for an extended period since 2010.
	
	
	I impose a sentence that is, given the subjective circumstances of the offender and the objective circumstances of the offence, at the lowest end of the range I consider appropriate and available. I also take into account the illness, the delay and the other subjective circumstances in fixing an unusually short non-parole period, given the length of the head sentence. In part, this has been effected also because of the fact of re-sentencing, and the effect of “double jeopardy”.
	


Sentence


	
	For each of the offences in Counts 1, 2 and 3, being the returns for 2003, 2004 and 2005 committed in 2005 and 2006 you are convicted and you are sentenced to three years’ imprisonment wholly concurrent, commencing 20 January 2016 and concluding 19 January 2019.
	
	
	For each of the offences in Counts 4, 5, 6 and 7, being the offences committed by the lodging of the return for the years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, on 23 September 2009, you are convicted and you are sentenced to imprisonment for four years, to be served concurrently with each other and commencing 20 January 2017 and concluding 19 January 2021.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence is a sentence of five years’ imprisonment commencing 20 January 2016 and concluding 19 January 2021. I fix a non-parole period of two years’ imprisonment, commencing 20 January 2016 and concluding 19 January 2018.

		29 April 2016",2016-04-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701703,R v Pratten (No 26) [2016] NSWSC 935,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Before the Court is a motion filed in Court and dealt with instanter seeking that the Court adjourn and stand adjourned until the final disposition of, or remitter of, proceedings that have been or are about to be commenced in the High Court. As an alternative to that proposition and for the purposes of today, what is sought is an adjournment for approximately two weeks.
	
	
	I understand that in this motion Mr Pratten has been unrepresented and I understand, therefore, the difficulty that may be associated with the issues that have been raised. The motion depends upon, and by affidavit annexes, two documents: One of which is an application for removal under s 40 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), removing the whole of the cause now pending in the Supreme Court, which is the trial and sentencing matter. That was filed on 27 April 2016. It is now 29 April 2016. Further, on 26 April 2016, a writ of summons was filed in the High Court by Mr Pratten against the Commonwealth of Australia as defendant.
	
	
	The summons says it concerns the interpretation of the Constitution, raises the limitations of a Commonwealth judicial power exercised by State Supreme Courts under Chapter III of the Constitution and refers to the “admix” of Commonwealth judicial powers and administrative functions of the Executive. It does not state with great clarity, what is said to be the administrative functions of the Executive.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the summons refers to the fact that the Court was looking at or deciding “financial advantage”, in the context of the understatement of income tax and it is said, pursuant to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), that the task of determining assessable income is a task reposed in the Australian Taxation Office as an administrative act. Therefore, the submission or summons suggests beyond the power of the Court in criminal proceedings to determine whether a financial advantage exists, it being an administrative function that is inconsistent with the functions of the Court as a Chapter III court.
	
	
	Now that is how I best understand the documents I have seen for the first time today. The relief sought is essentially the quashing of the guilty verdict and the permanent stay of the proceedings.
	
	
	There are two aspects to it, it seems to me, with which I need to deal.
	
	
	First there is, as yet (as has been somewhat tritely pointed out by the Crown), no High Court order made under s 40, either on an interim or permanent basis. There are, therefore, no orders removing from this Court the proceedings that are currently before it.
	
	
	The second aspect, referred to by Mr Pratten in his submissions, is the effect the proceedings may have on any rights Mr Pratten may have under Part IVC of the Income Tax Assessment Act, being the rights of review of income tax assessments.
	
	
	During the course of these proceedings, the Court has been at pains to point out to the jury and to the public that the assessment by the Australian Taxation Office of Mr Pratten’s assessment is a matter almost wholly irrelevant to the issues before the Court. The only issue before the Court, in terms of the guilt of the accused, was whether there had been dishonestly and by deception the obtaining of a financial advantage.
	
	
	As it happens, the financial advantage that is alleged by the Crown is the understatement of income, as a consequence of which it was necessary for the Crown to prove that it was not satisfied with the income tax that had been paid or assessed as a result of the statements made. It was then for the jury to determine whether the income tax had been understated and, if so, dishonestly and by deception.
	
	
	The Crown, in its case, and the jury, in accordance with the directions, did not look at the definition of “income” under the Income Tax Assessment Act, other than that which would be income, in the ordinary sense of the term. Thus, special definitions of “income” that would require certain amounts received that might not fit the definition of “income” within the ordinary meaning were not issues that were raised by the Crown against Mr Pratten.
	
	
	On the other hand, if there were special or other definitions, the effect of which was to take particular receipts out of “income”, in its ordinary sense, then the Crown was not relying upon those matters.
	
	
	As a consequence, whether that which is found by the Court, be it the jury or the judge on sentence, to be the understatement of income bears little or no relationship to what may or may not be assessed as income by the Australian Taxation Office. It is certainly the case that nothing this Court has done, in relation to the finding of guilt, and nothing it could do, in relation to the sentence it passes, could interfere with the independent assessment of any review that may be lodged and the subject of procedures under Part IVC of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Therefore, it does not seem to me, on the face of it, that there is an arguable proposition that involves Chapter III of the Constitution. Of course ultimately that is not a matter for me. That is a matter for the High Court of Australia. Nevertheless, in dealing with an application for an adjournment, I have to be satisfied that there is an arguable ground relating to that which is put before me in relation to the High Court proceedings.
	
	
	The second aspect of that matter is, if I were found to be wrong in that assessment of the arguability of the ground, the application before the High Court is not rendered nugatory by anything I hereafter may proceed to engage upon or anything that has already happened. Indeed, as I understand that which is put before the High Court, the findings of guilt that have already been made are sought to be quashed.
	
	
	The High Court will be looking at those matters that have been completed. The imposition of the sentence makes no difference to the capacity of the High Court to deal with the issues that have been raised and certainly does not render the High Court proceedings nugatory.
	
	
	The third aspect is the question of timing raised by the Crown. These matters in the High Court have been filed literally at the 13th Hour.
	
	
	These proceedings were originally set down for sentence late last year and were unfortunately required to be adjourned. They are now here today. The matters in relation to the High Court proceedings were filed earlier in this week while the Court, as presently constituted, it seems, was in Griffith.
	
	
	The second aspect of that is that the Crown says there should be fact-finding. I am not sure that the High Court would be assisted one way or the other with the facts that I may find, given that the constitutional question does not turn on the facts as such and it is unlikely to be, in any sense, a factual question.
	
	
	The last matter is a matter not raised by any of the parties but one that I should, as a matter of fullness, raise. There can be little doubt that the rules of procedural fairness may well impose a duty on a Court or Tribunal to grant an adjournment and a failure to grant the adjournment, the effect of which is to deprive a party of the reasonable opportunity to prepare or to present a case before the Court or Tribunal, would amount to a denial of procedural fairness and would be wrong and, if done, properly overturned. The authority on that question is abundant.
	
	
	The authority that immediately comes to mind is the judgment of his Honour Justice Deane, then a member of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, in Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 343. It was cited with authority by the High Court in Re Coldham; Ex Parte Municipal Officers Association of Australia (also cited as Re Architects of Australia Association; Ex Parte Municipal Officers’ Association) [1989] HCA 13; (1989) 63 ALJR 298 and by the Full Court of the Federal Court more recently in United Voice v Restaurant and Catering Association of Victoria [2014] FCAFC 121; (2014) 226 FCR 255, but, as Justice Deane made clear and as the High Court has made clear on a number of occasions, the function of the Court is to provide a reasonable opportunity to prepare and to present the case; it is not the function of the Court to ensure that a party makes the best use of the opportunity given.
	
	
	On 21 May 2013 I delivered judgment in a matter called Pratten v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWSC 594. Paragraph 6 of that judgment summarises the case for Mr Pratten, or part of it, and I recite the paragraph:
	


“By the summons, Mr Pratten also raises certain issues under the Constitution. He challenges the determination by the Court of ‘financial advantage’ as being ‘an impermissible administrative act and...contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers’.”


	
	At [160] of the judgment the Court said this:
	


“I then turn to the constitutional question. The term ‘constitutional question’, being a submission that the Court is not entitled to determine the meaning of the term ‘financial advantage’ or whether a ‘financial advantage’ has occurred because it would constitute ‘an impermissible administrative act’ and be contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers.”


	
	The submission has two aspects. The first is, as I understand it, that the determination of ‘financial advantage’ is an administrative decision reposed in the ATO or the FCT by the Income Tax Assessment Act. The second aspect is that the Court, by equating the financial advantage with the amount owing under the amended tax assessments, has either made the tax an unconstitutional tax by denying the right of appeal or challenged or abrogated Mr Pratten’s right to silence and altered the burden of proof in a criminal trial. The submission is untenable.
	
	
	The fact of the matter is that judgment issued on 21 May 2013, it was argued, I hasten to add, by extremely competent counsel, who has since taken Silk and two juniors.
	
	
	The judgment of 21 May 2013 was subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. That appeal was withdrawn in December 2013 without being heard.
	
	
	The opportunity to run the very point that is sought to be run in the High Court has been given and taken. It is, frankly, inconsistent with the administration of justice now to adjourn the proceedings simply because Mr Pratten, or those that were advising him, did not take advantage of the two opportunities they had: before the Court in May 2013, when they ran the case at first instance; and after May 2013, when they filed an appeal, listed for hearing in December 2013 before the Court of Appeal and failed to pursue the appeal to its completion (namely by withdrawing two days before it was listed) and then failed to agitate the matter to completion by a subsequent appeal to the High Court.
	
	
	The adjournment is refused.

2701708,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Krstic [2016] NSWSC 510,"Judgment


	
	On 21 October 2015 Button J made restraining orders pursuant to s 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), relevantly, in relation to property contained in schedule 5 of an Amended Summons. The Plaintiff now seeks forfeiture pursuant to s 49 of the Act in relation to the property in Schedule 5. That property consists of funds standing to the credit of two companies, being Option One (Aust) Pty Ltd and Advanced Option (Aust) Pty Ltd, with the various financial institutions set out in Schedule 5.
	
	
	The Court is required to make a forfeiture order under s 49 if the matters enumerated in subs (1) of that section are satisfied. There are three relevant matters to be satisfied on the present application. They are: that it is a responsible authority who is applying for the order; secondly, that the restraining order has been in force for at least six months; and, thirdly, that the Court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property. Another requirement set out in s 49(1)(c) of the Act is not required to be satisfied in the present case pursuant to subs (3) of s 49.
	
	
	In the present case, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff is a responsible authority as defined in the Act. I am satisfied from the affidavits of Catherine Therese Horan sworn 7 March 2016 and 20 April 2016 that reasonable steps have been taken to identify and notify the persons with an interest in the property. Notification was made to one of two email addresses directed by the Court on an application for substituted service. That email address is branco1950@hotmail.com. The alternative email address in the order made by the Court for substituted service resulted in a notification that there was no such address. However, I am satisfied from these affidavits that the relevant information has been forwarded to the defendant and the interested parties.
	
	
	The third requirement is satisfied because the restraining orders were made on 21 October 2015, being more than six months prior to today. The background to the making of the restraining orders is contained in an affidavit of Matthew Oliveiro sworn 21 April 2016, also relied on in this application.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the Short Minutes of Order. The matter is listed for directions before the Registrar on 31 May 2016 and there is liberty to restore on three days' notice. The orders may be taken out forthwith.

		28 April 2016",2016-04-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701710,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Dickson (No. 2) [2016] NSWSC 574,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By notice of motion, filed in Court on 29 April 2015, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (the Commissioner) seeks an order that the applications made by Dagmar Maxianova (the fourth defendant) (by notices of motion filed on 10 August 2015 and 1 December 2015) for exclusion from forfeiture of certain property be dismissed.
	
	
	The plaintiff relied on the affidavit of Alana Claire Jessep sworn 28 April 2016.
	
	
	At the conclusion of the hearing of the Commissioner’s application I made an order dismissing Ms Maxianova’s application for exclusion and ordering her to pay the Commissioner’s costs. My reasons for these orders follow.
	


Relevant legislative provisions

Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth)


	
	Section 94(6) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) deals with excluding property from forfeiture and relevantly provides:
	


(1) The court that made a *restraining order referred to in paragraph 92(1)(b) must make an order excluding particular property from forfeiture under this Part if:

(a) a person (the applicant) has applied for an order under this section; and

…

…

(6) The application must not be heard until the *responsible authority has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct *examinations in relation to the application.

[Terms marked with an asterisk are defined in s338 of the POCA].


	
	Section 180 of the Act relevantly provides:
	


Examination orders relating to restraining orders

(1)  If a * restraining order is in force, the court that made the restraining order, or any other court that could have made the restraining order, may make an order (an examination order ) for the * examination of any person, including:

(a)  a person whose property is, or a person who has or claims an * interest in property that is, the subject of the restraining order; or

(b)  a person who is a * suspect in relation to the restraining order; or

(c)  the spouse or * de facto partner of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b);

about the * affairs of a person referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c).

 (2)  The * examination order ceases to have effect if the * restraining order to which it relates ceases to have effect.


	
	Section 180A of the Act provides:
	


Examination orders relating to applications for exclusion from forfeiture

(1)  If an application for an order under section 73 or 94 for an * interest in property to be excluded from forfeiture is made, the court to which the application is made may make an order (an examination order) for the * examination of any person including: 

(a)  a person who has or claims an interest in the property; or 

(b)  the spouse or * de facto partner of a person referred to in paragraph (a); 

about the * affairs of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). 

(2)  The * examination order ceases to have effect when: 

(a)  the application is withdrawn; or 

(b)  the court makes a decision on the application.


	
	Section 92 of the Act provides that property which has been the subject of a restraining order is forfeited to the Commonwealth within six months of, relevantly, the conviction day, unless an extension order has been made under s 93.
	
	
	Section 93 of the Act, which provides for orders for extension, provides that an order for extension cannot extend beyond 15 months from the date of conviction.
	


Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW)


	
	Rule 13.4 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) confers power on the court to dismiss frivolous or vexatious proceedings in the following terms:
	


(1) If in any proceedings it appears to the court that in relation to the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings:

(a) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or

(b) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, or

(c) the proceedings are an abuse of the process of the court,

the court may order that the proceedings be dismissed generally or in relation to that claim.

(2) The court may receive evidence on the hearing of an application for an order under subrule (1).

The facts


	
	The fourth defendant became the third wife of Anthony Dickson (the first defendant) when they married in Bratislava on 10 July 2004. She was then 28 years old. The first and fourth defendants ceased to cohabitate as a married couple sometime around 2010 or 2011. They assert that they have been divorced.
	
	
	By contract dated 8 February 2005, Mr Dickson agreed to purchase a residential property at Northbridge for $4.6million. Subsequently, Ms Maxianova was substituted as the purchaser. Upon settlement of the purchase she was registered as the sole proprietor of the property. There is a registered mortgage on the title of the property in favour of the fifth defendant, Dampier Finance FX Strategies Limited, a deregistered company, which was previously registered in New Zealand. No application had been made by the fifth defendant in respect of its interest.
	
	
	On 5 April 2012, McCallum J made orders pursuant to s 18 of the Act restraining the interests of Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova in the Northbridge property, in part on the basis that the Commissioner established that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the Northbridge Property was under Mr Dickson’s effective control (as defined in s337); and Mr Dickson had committed a serious offence (as defined in s338).
	
	
	Her Honour also made orders pursuant to s 180 of the Act orders for the examination of Ms Maxianova about Mr Dickson’s affairs of the first defendant: (McCallum J: Order 18(a)). An examination notice directed to Ms Maxianova was issued by Deputy President Tamberlin of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in his capacity as an approved examiner under the Act. Ms Maxianova was examined on 15 April 2013 pursuant to the s180 order.
	
	
	On 20 March 2015, Mr Dickson was convicted and sentenced following trial by jury for offences contrary to:
	



	
	s 135.4(5) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (dishonestly causing a loss, or dishonestly causing a risk of loss, to a third person, namely the Commonwealth, knowing or believing the loss would occur or where there was a substantial risk of the loss occurring); and
	
	
	ss 11.5(1) and 400.3(1) of the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (conspiring with Mr Issakidis (the second defendant) to deal with property of a value of $1m or more believing it to be the proceeds of crime).
	



	
	As referred to above Ms Maxianova filed two separate applications for exclusion from forfeiture pursuant to s 94, on 10 August 2015 and 1 December 2015 respectively. She ultimately filed her evidence in support of her application on 1 December 2015. Although the timetable provided for any further evidence to be filed by 22 February 2016, no further evidence was filed.
	
	
	On 8 December 2015, Schmidt J made orders by consent: extending the automatic forfeiture time to 19 May 2016. Her Honour also ordered that Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova be examined pursuant to s180A of the Act. The Court noted that the intention was that those examinations would occur on or before 31 March 2016, before the Commissioner was required to file the evidence on which he sought to rely in opposition to the applications that certain property be excluded from forfeiture.
	
	
	On 18 February 2016, examination notices were issued to Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova in accordance with ss 183 and 185(2) of the Act for their attendance for examination and for the production of certain documents before Senior Member Lazanas, in her capacity as an approved examiner under the Act. On or about 19 February 2016, the March examination dates were rescheduled to the dates in April 2016 to accommodate the examinees. Ms Maxianova was required to attend her examination and produce certain documents on 8 April 2016.
	
	
	On 30 and 31 March 2016, Ms Maxianova’s solicitors applied to Senior Member Lazanas for an order permitting her to appear at her examination by video-link. The Commissioner opposed that application.
	
	
	On 5 April 2016, Senior Member Lazanas refused Ms Maxianova’s application on the bases that the Senior Member was not satisfied:
	



	
	that video-link facilities were or could be reasonably made available in Bratislava (noting that Ms Maxianova was aware since 22 February 2016 that any request to appear via video-link would need to be accompanied by evidence that such facilities either were or could be made available);
	
	
	that attendance in person would cause unreasonable expense or inconvenience to Ms Maxianova in circumstances where the Commissioner had undertaken to pay her reasonable travel costs and expenses to attend the examination in Australia; and
	
	
	it would not be consistent with the interests of justice that she be examined by video-link.
	



	
	On 8 April 2016, Ms Maxianova failed to attend her examination. As a result, the Commissioner was denied the opportunity to conduct an examination of her regarding her exclusion from forfeiture application.
	
	
	On 12 April 2016, the Commissioner wrote to the solicitors for Mr Dickson and Ms Maxianova and confirmed that each was required to attend in person for cross-examination at the hearing of their exclusion from forfeiture applications. The Commissioner also noted that Ms Maxianova’s failure to attend her examination on 8 April 2016 may not only constitute an offence under s 195 of the Act but also have the effect that Ms Maxianova’s exclusion application would be dismissed by reason of s 94(6) of the Act.
	
	
	By operation of s 92 of the Act and two extensions of time granted under s 93, the Northbridge Property is due to automatically forfeit to the Commonwealth by 19 May 2016 unless either: an exclusion order is made; or a further order extending the time for automatic forfeiture under s 93. No order can be made extending the time beyond 20 June 2016 (being 15 months from the date of conviction).
	


Consideration


	
	Section 94(6) of the Act prohibits the hearing of Ms Maxianova’s exclusion application until the Commissioner has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct examinations in relation to her application. Because of Ms Maxianova’s refusal to attend the examination on 8 April 2016, the Commissioner has not had such an opportunity. Accordingly, I am not entitled to entertain her application.
	
	
	It follows that her application must be dismissed by reason of the statutory prohibition in s 94(6).
	
	
	The Commissioner also contended that I ought also dismiss the proceedings by Ms Maxianova on the grounds that they constitute an abuse of process: UCPR r 13.4(1)(c). Mr Siafakas appeared on behalf of Ms Maxianova for the purposes of her application to give evidence by video-link (which I refused). He would have appeared on her behalf had she attended the hearing but sought leave to be excused once it became clear that she was not going to appear at the hearing. He contended in support of her application to give evidence by video-link that she was a single mother and living in Bratislava with her daughter, that her parents were elderly and required care and that she would lose her job if she took time off to come to Australia. These matters could not be tested. If they had been established it may be that they would have the effect that the application could not properly be characterised as an abuse of process. By reason of the statutory prohibition, it is not necessary to determine whether her application for an exclusion order amounts to an abuse of process since the consequence of s 94(6) is that her application must not be heard.
	


Orders


	
	Following the hearing of this application on 2 May 2016 I made the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the fourth defendant’s application for exclusion from forfeiture made by motions filed on 10 August 2015 and 1 December 2015.
	
	
	Order the fourth defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs.

		15 June 2016",2016-05-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701721,R v Macdonald (No4) [2016] NSWSC 486,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By notice of motion filed in court on 1 April 2016, the accused Ian Macdonald seeks a stay of these proceedings “until such point as the defendant has sufficient financial funding to retain legal representation for his defence”. An application for such a stay is known as a Dietrich application (so named after Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292). This is the second such application. The first was filed on 21 January 2016 and withdrawn on 23 February 2016.
	
	
	On 20 April 2016 Mr Brady SC, who appeared with Mr Mackay on behalf of Mr Macdonald, indicated that Mr Macdonald also sought, in the alternative, an adjournment of the trial, and, indeed, of the Dietrich application in light of recent events.
	
	
	In order to address the Dietrich application and the application for an adjournment, it is necessary to set out what is revealed in the evidence in some detail.
	


The facts


	
	Mr Macdonald became a Member of the Legislative Council of the New South Wales Parliament on 19 March 1988. In March 2002, while he was a Member of Parliament, he bought, for $730,000, a property in Strathallen Avenue in Northbridge (the Northbridge Property) of which he was sole owner.
	


Mr Macdonald’s marriage in 2007


	
	In about 2007 Mr Macdonald married Anita Gylseth who was then employed in the New South Wales Public Service. Ms Gylseth has three daughters, one of whom is intellectually handicapped. In 2007 Ms Gylseth sold a property she owned at North Narrabeen for $835,000. The evidence does not reveal the net proceeds of sale. In the same year, the couple purchased a rural property in Orange for $675,000 (Property A).
	
	
	Ms Gylseth resigned from the Public Service in 2009 and received superannuation benefits. She used at least some of her pay-out, an amount in the order of $40,000, to buy shares. She has since traded those and other shares using a CommSec account. The details of her shareholding are not revealed by the evidence, although her tax returns show dividends received.
	


Mr Macdonald’s retirement from politics in 2010


	
	Mr Macdonald retired from Parliament in June 2010. He was entitled to commute at least part of his superannuation benefits. He chose to commute $1.32m into a lump sum payment. He receives monthly payments which are currently paid at the rate of $2,271. He believes that the commutation decision is one that can be made once only and that, accordingly, he is not entitled to commute any more of his entitlement into a lump sum. No documentary evidence has been provided to support that belief. Nor has Mr Macdonald made any further application to commute his entitlement to superannuation. Accordingly, the accuracy of his belief remains untested.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald used part of the $1.32m to improve the Northbridge Property before its eventual sale. In 2010 Mr Macdonald established a family trust. The trust deed is not in evidence.
	
	
	In 2011 Mr Macdonald used his superannuation lump sum to renovate the house on Property A and make various improvements to the land. In April 2011 the couple purchased another property in Orange, near Property A (Property B), for $475,000. Mr Macdonald’s superannuation funds were also used for the purchase.
	


The ICAC investigation in 2011


	
	On 23 November 2011 both Houses of the New South Wales Parliament referred various matters to New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) which concerned, in part, the allocation by Mr Macdonald, as a Minister of the Crown, of an Exploration Licence to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd. As a result of this referral, ICAC conducted an investigation, under the names Operations Acacia, Jasper and Indus.
	
	
	In June 2012 the Northbridge Property was sold for $1,187,000. The net proceeds, $482,000, were applied to reduce the mortgage secured by Property A. Mr Macdonald and his wife conducted a business there associated with apple orchards, under the business name “Andoyaskye”.
	


The ICAC public inquiry and report in 2013


	
	The ICAC conducted a public inquiry into Operations Acacia, Jasper and Indus. The public inquiry into Operation Acacia ran from 18 March 2013 until 17 May 2013 and occupied 37 hearing days within that period.
	
	
	In August 2013 ICAC published a report (ICAC Report) in which it recommended that consideration be given to obtaining the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) as to whether Mr Macdonald ought be prosecuted for the common law offence of misconduct in public office.
	


Property transactions after the ICAC Report


	
	In the same month as the ICAC Report was published, Mr Macdonald and his wife sold Property A for $880,000, which at that stage secured a mortgage in the sum of about $680,000. The second of the Orange properties (Property B) was sold in September 2014 for $900,000 and was subject to a mortgage in the sum of about $150,000. Both sales attracted capital gains tax.
	
	
	In September 2014, a house in Leura (the Leura Property) was purchased in the name of Mr Macdonald’s wife. The net proceeds of sale of Property B, approximately $600,000, were used to reduce a personal loan by $75,000 (from Mr Gerathy, referred to below) and to purchase the Leura Property. According to Mr Macdonald, the Leura Property is worth $650,000 and is subject to a mortgage of $150,000.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald explained why the Leura Property was purchased in his wife’s name, and how the mortgage is funded in the following exchange in his cross-examination:
	


Q. Now, Mr Macdonald, why didn't you acquire Leura together?

A. Well, I believed that since the publicity I have received since 2014 and that I was in a consultancy business at the time working in a legal firm I, am, believed it was prudent to, prudent to protect my wife and her intellectually handicapped daughter by putting the house in her name to prevent potential litigation that may occur in the future relating to my consultancies.


	
	On 3 September 2014, Mr Macdonald, using the business name “Andoyaskye”, obtained lease finance for a Volvo motor vehicle. The opening debit on the Esanda statement of ledger was $65,016.60; the monthly payments are in the order of $860.
	


The criminal proceedings


	
	On 20 November 2014 Mr Macdonald was served (by service on his solicitor, Nicholas Dan) with a Court Attendance Notice in relation to the charge the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	After he received the Court Attendance Notice on 20 November 2014, Mr Macdonald instructed Mr Dan to seek a grant of legal assistance from the NSW Justice Department. A letter to that effect dated 12 December 2014 was sent by Mr Dan. This application was, according to Mr Macdonald, based on what he understood to be the government guidelines for ex gratia legal assistance. The correspondence explained that his decision to grant the Exploration Licence to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd (the conduct that is the subject of the charges) was made within his ministerial discretion and was determined on the written recommendation of the Department. He further advised that he did not have sufficient funds to defend the matter.
	
	
	On 15 December 2014 the solicitor for the DPP wrote to Mr Dan and enclosed 60 volumes of material which included:
	


(a)    23 volumes containing statements, records of interview and transcript and an index for this material.

(b)    27 volumes of material tendered during the public hearing of Operation Acacia and an index for this material.

(c)   9 volumes containing exhibits A-T tendered during the public hearing of Operation Acacia and an index for this material.

(d)   1 volume of material containing the Department of Primary Industries documents for Watermark and Caroona.


	
	The DPP also provided to Mr Dan a spread sheet which listed documents and electronic material seized by ICAC as part of Operation Acacia and advised that if he wished to view the material in the attached spread sheet that he was to contact Paul Grainger, Senior Investigator, ICAC, whose phone number was provided.
	
	
	On 11 February 2015 Brad Hazzard, the then Attorney-General, responded to Mr Macdonald’s request for public funding for his legal defence, in part in the following terms:
	


“on balance, it was not considered that assistance should be granted to fund the Defence of the proceedings which arose out of the ICAC findings following the finding that Mr MacDonald had acted corruptly”


	
	On 25 February 2015 an ex officio indictment for two offences of misconduct in public office was filed in the District Court at Sydney and served on Mr Macdonald by service on Mr Dan. On 13 March 2015 Bathurst CJ granted an exemption pursuant to s 128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to present the indictment in this Court.
	
	
	In March 2015 Ms Gylseth and her daughter (who has an intellectual disability) went to Hong Kong to celebrate the daughter’s birthday. Mr Macdonald subsequently explained the expenditure (which he said was funded by Ms Gylseth’s own superannuation) to the Legal Aid Commission in the following terms:
	


“Ms Gylseth chose to take her daughter to Hong Kong for a week because she loves everything Asian and it was her birthday. Ms Gylseth needed a holiday too.”


	
	Mr Macdonald was adamant that he could not “tell [his] wife what to do with her superannuation funds”.
	
	
	On about 19 March 2015 Mr Macdonald received $20,000 by way of settlement of defamation proceedings which he had brought. He could not say, in cross-examination on 20 April 2016, into which or whose (between him and his wife) account the money had been banked because: “My wife does all our banking”.
	
	
	On 8 April 2015 Mr Dan wrote to the executive government again to reiterate Mr Macdonald’s request for funding for legal assistance in his trial.
	
	
	On 28 April 2015 the solicitor for the DPP wrote to Mr Dan enclosing transcripts of private compulsory examinations conducted with 46 witnesses called by ICAC during Operation Acacia and 6 volumes of documents tendered as exhibits or marked for identification during the private hearings.
	
	
	On 29 April 2015 Mr Dan again wrote to the executive government to reiterate Mr Macdonald’s request for funding for legal assistance in his trial.
	
	
	On 6 May 2015 a copy of the Crown Case Statement and a three volume “Document Chronology’ was served on Mr Dan. The documents referred to in the Crown Case Statement were contained in the Document Chronology.
	


The arraignment of Mr Macdonald on 8 May 2015


	
	On 8 May 2015 the indictment was presented in the Arraignments List and Mr Macdonald was arraigned before Johnson J. He pleaded not guilty. The Crown Case Statement was provided to the Court. On that occasion, Johnson J listed the matter for trial to commence on 14 March 2016. His Honour also listed the matter for mention on 6 July 2015 and directed Mr Macdonald to file any pre-trial notices of motion and supporting affidavits by 26 June 2015.
	
	
	In June 2015, before he had received the response from the Attorney-General, Mr Macdonald made an application to the Legal Aid Commission for legal aid. The Commission required him to provide “full financial disclosure” of his own financial position and that of his wife, Ms Gylseth, for the previous two years, including records of income and expenditure. His application was refused.
	
	
	On 2 June 2015 Mr Dan was provided a list of 33 witnesses that the Crown intended to call at the time the list was provided.
	
	
	On 11 June 2015 St George Bank wrote to Ms Gylseth to inform her that it was no longer able to provide her with financial services. It nominated two accounts, a portfolio loan and a credit card, which would “remain open for regular payments” but from which she would not be permitted to make withdrawals. Mr Macdonald believes the bank to have been influenced by the matters the subject of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 6 July 2015 both accused (Mr Macdonald and Mr Maitland) sought and were granted an extension of time for the filing of any pre-trial notices of motion. Justice Johnson listed the matter for mention on 11 September 2015 and extended the time for filing any pre-trial notices of motion to 7 September 2015.
	
	
	In mid-July 2015 Mr Macdonald and his wife went to Perisher, a ski resort in Australia.
	
	
	By letter dated 31 July 2015, which was received by Mr Dan on 6 August 2015, the Attorney-General (Gabrielle Upton) refused Mr Macdonald’s application for funding for legal assistance. The grounds of the refusal were not given.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald appealed to the Legal Aid Review Committee against the refusal of legal aid. By email dated 11 September 2015, Mr Doumit, of the Legal Aid Commission, wrote to Mr Dan setting out the basis of the initial refusal. The email read in part as follows:
	


While the applicant is eligible for aid based on a lack of income and assets with little equity (other than the principal place of residence) Legal Aid NSW determined that:

the discretionary expenditure evident from the bank statements

the ownership of two luxury cars

the indication from the financially associated person, Ms Gylseth, as to future travel plans for Christmas – when considered in combination with the travel to Hong Kong in February 2015

constitutes information that suggests that the applicant’s

lifestyle

activities, and/or

interests

are such that, in the opinion of Legal Aid NSW, the applicant has access to sufficient means to be able to afford to pay for the services of a private legal practitioner without undue hardship.

I note that the matter is listed for 2 October 2015 and Justice Johnson indicated he would expect the issue of legal aid to be resolved by that date.

Please provide the written appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee by return email at your earliest convenience but no later than 4.00 pm Wednesday, 16 September 2015 to allow the matter to go before the Legal Aid Review Committee.

The appeal will need to address the discretionary expenditure, the ownership of the luxury vehicles and the travel plans of the financially associated person.


	
	At the mention of the matter in the Arraignments List on 11 September 2015 Mr Dan sought an adjournment in order to enable Mr Macdonald to apply for a review of the refusal of legal aid. Johnson J adjourned the matter for further mention on 2 October 2015. In the meantime the co-accused, Mr Maitland, sought a separate trial. His application was listed for hearing on 13 November 2015.
	
	
	On a date not later than 26 September 2015 Mr Macdonald launched a public website seeking funds for his legal defence. The account, in the name of “Bilbie Dan Pty Ltd”, reflects the name of the firm of Mr Dan, his solicitor.
	
	
	On 1 October 2015, the day before the adjourned mention date, Mr Macdonald filed an application for review of the refusal of the grant of legal aid. On 2 October 2015, Mr Dan applied for an adjournment of the mention and an extension of the time within which any pre-trial applications were to be filed. Justice Johnson acceded to the application, adjourned the mention date and directed the accused to file any pre-trial motions and supporting affidavits by 16 October 2015.
	
	
	By letter dated 22 October 2015 the Legal Aid Review Committee wrote to Mr Macdonald to inform him that his appeal had also been refused. The letter said in part:
	


The Committee disallowed the appeal because the applicant’s lifestyle, activities or interests suggest that the appellant has access to sufficient means to be able to pay for the services of a private legal practitioner without undue hardship.

Further, it is satisfied that the appellant has the ability to pay his own legal costs, having regard to his assets.


	
	Although Mr Macdonald gave evidence in this Court that he has contemplated challenging the refusal of legal aid (by separate proceedings in this Court), he has not done so.
	
	
	In October 2015 Mr Macdonald received $21,000 for his consultancy work, which, according to his evidence, is “success-based”. He used these funds to decrease his car lease payments (for another Volvo motor vehicle) from $1,200 per month to $650 per month. The opening debit on the Esanda statement of ledger 15 October 2015 was $54,295.08; the monthly payments are $651.37.
	
	
	The details of the work Mr Macdonald had performed which produced the sum of $21,000 were revealed for the first time in re-examination on 20 April 2016. He had introduced Chinese investors to a rural property on which a vineyard, restaurant, accommodation facilities and wedding facilities were either already located, or to be located.
	
	
	On 6 November 2015 Greg James QC appeared on behalf of Mr Macdonald at the mention. He informed Johnson J that the application for review of the refusal of legal aid had been dismissed. The matter was adjourned to 13 November 2015. On that day, Mr Maitland’s application for a separate trial was heard. No submissions were made on behalf of Mr Macdonald on that day. At the conclusion of the hearing, judgment was reserved and listed for judgment on 17 November 2015.
	
	
	On 17 November 2015 Johnson J refused Mr Maitland’s application for a separate trial. Both matters were adjourned for mention on 4 December 2015.
	
	
	On 4 December 2015 Mr Evan James of counsel appeared on behalf of Mr Macdonald. He informed Johnson J that he was not funded to appear at the trial but that his client was attempting to find funds for legal representation at the trial. Johnson J listed the matter for mention on 1 February 2015 and directed that any pre-trial motions and affidavits be filed by 20 January 2016.
	
	
	In about Christmas 2015 Mr Macdonald’s wife and the youngest of her three daughters, and one of the daughter’s friends, travelled to Norway. Ms Gylseth was anxious to visit two of her elderly aunts who lived there.
	
	
	On 14 January 2016 the solicitor for the DPP sent a letter to Mr Dan attaching the Notice of Prosecution Case and one folder in double-sided print containing witness proofs and statements for 33 witnesses on the Crown witness list and a copy of documents referred to in those witness proofs and statements, not previously included in the Document Chronology. The letter said that:
	


“The witness proofs / statements provided reflect the evidence that the prosecution currently anticipates calling from these witness in the above trial. Some variation to the evidence to be called may occur, depending on the issues that arise before or during the trial. Please note that the bulk of the material previously served by the Prosecution was served in accordance with the Prosecution’s obligation of disclosure.”

The filing of the first Dietrich application on 21 January 2016


	
	On 21 January 2016 Mr Macdonald filed the first of two notices of motion seeking a stay of the proceedings. In his affidavit in support he deposed that, by 21 January 2016, he had earned a gross amount of $63,000 since 30 June 2015. He admitted in cross-examination that he had “many” matters on which he had done work but not yet been paid but might be paid in the future. He gave no details of any such matters, or the likely success fee if any came to fruition until his counsel sought leave to adduce further evidence in chief with respect to such matters at the hearing on 20 April 2016.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 21 January 2016, Mr Macdonald deposed that he had no assets and that he had liabilities of $50,000 (being the deficiency created by the loans due on the cars being exceeded by their combined value); credit card liabilities of $15,000 and a liability on a personal loan of approximately $200,000.
	
	
	In cross-examination it emerged that the personal loan was owed to Mr Gerathy, Mr Macdonald’s former business partner. He has repaid a total of $207,000 which included $75,000 of the proceeds of Property B. The amount outstanding on the loan is to be reduced by reference to the amount of work that Mr Macdonald performed for the company. Mr Macdonald deposed that the issue of what amount should be deducted from the loan had not been addressed, in part at least because of Mr Gerathy’s long-standing illness. Mr Macdonald admitted that there was no interest rate on the loan and Mr Gerathy had never charged interest on it. It is not secured against any asset.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 21 January 2016 Mr Macdonald also deposed that, as at that date, no funds had been forthcoming from the public website he had launched to raise funds for his legal defence.
	
	
	On 25 January 2016, the solicitor for the DPP wrote to Mr Dan, noting that Mr Macdonald had not exhibited to his affidavit of 21 January 2016 the material which he had supplied to the Legal Aid Commission or the Legal Aid Review Committee. The solicitor made the following request:
	


“Please provide a copy of all documents provided to the Legal Aid Commission in relation to Mr Macdonald’s application for a grant of legal aid and Mr Macdonald’s appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee in relation to:

Mr Macdonald’s financial circumstances including his assets, income and expenditure and the assets, income and expenditure of any financially associated person.

Mr Macdonald or any financially associated person’s ability to fund a private legal representative for the accused.

Please provide details in relation to the value of all mortgages that related to the properties listed in paragraph 33 of Mr Macdonald’s affidavit.”


	
	Mr Macdonald refused to provide the documents to the Crown. These documents were first proffered in these proceedings when Mr Mackay sought to tender them on behalf of Mr Macdonald on 13 April 2016 in re-examination, as referred to in more detail below.
	


Mention in the Arraignments List on 1 February 2016


	
	The matter came before Johnson J in the arraignments list on 1 February 2016. Mr Macdonald was represented by Mr Greg James QC, who asked the Court to stand the motion over with liberty to restore on 48 hours’ notice. It is necessary to set out at length various statements made by Mr James in the course of the mention. Mr James said (in terms which I infer reflected his then instructions):
	


I do not appear in the trial; I am unable to do so both by reason of commitment and other matters. Nor does Mr Evan James appear at the trial. Mr Boulten is unable to appear at the trial. However, this morning I have been able to make inquiries myself with a view to ascertaining whether other senior counsel competent in this field could appear at the trial. I have received intonations [intimations] from Mr Ramage QC that there is a strong prospect he could. Regrettably other inquiries have not produced anybody else. They are such as I have been able to make personally this morning.

The application before your Honour is a Dietrich application; that is that he does not have the funds to be able to afford representation at a state of competence such as to provide that the trial would be a fair trial according to law if conducted without counsel of that competence.

There is much material before your Honour in terms of both affidavits concerning his available means. There has been a series of conferences conducted by my instructing solicitor on Friday and over the weekend. They have culminated in a conference early this morning in which a strong prospect has arisen of his being able to achieve a fixed sum of funds such that Mr Ramage would be, if briefed, able to be briefed for a four week trial. 

…

From my client's viewpoint he wishes this trial to go ahead but he does wish to be competently represented.

We should not proceed with the Dietrich application while there is a prospect of sufficient strength that he will receive the relevant funding and be able to get the relevant counsel.

At present, I have agreed to assist such solicitor and counsel with questions of law by way of advice and assistance and questions of preparation in order to try to facilitate the matter coming forward as cleanly as possible. I understand that the prosecution have recently in that regard attempted to rationalise the case to restrict the materials which otherwise would have been enormous to jury bundles of approximately two and a half volumes, and it may be that that can be cut down to two volumes of proofs, and it may well be that by use of facts not to be contested provisions of the Evidence Act or admissions, all of that can be substantially cut down here.

…

I'm hopeful we can distill that [the Crown bundle] down further, but that would be subject to the views of trial counsel and, from a practical viewpoint, the views of my client's funders, with a view to making sure that it can be done within the parameters of the funding and the relevant time.

…

I would, frankly, regard it as inappropriate for it [the Dietrich application] to proceed whilst there are prospects that have been identified to me of such strength as to his getting funding and counsel.

…

HIS HONOUR: What are you asking occur today with the notice of motion which has been brought by Mr Macdonald and is before Court?

JAMES: Stand it down with liberty to restore on 48 hours' notice, the onus being on my client that if it is to proceed he will have to get it back into court. And in the meantime, I can hold some discussions with Mr English and Mr Neil, Mr Ramage and my instructing solicitor can hold discussions with the funders with a view to trying to get it strapped up. The closer it gets toward the trial date the less likely it is for a Dietrich application to succeed, and my client hears me say that and knows it.

…

I should indicate to your Honour that I would expect there would be pre-trial admissibility areas so that that mention date, if sufficiently far away to enable who is appearing to be able to identify those areas amongst what is still a highly complex and substantial brief, the mention date could double for a directions hearing as well as dealing with the Dietrich matters.

…

The Crown case statement in respect of Mr Macdonald is some seven pages long. There are matters that are plainly unlikely to be at issue; that is public official, in the course of public office. The matters that will be at issue will be the inferences the Crown says can be drawn from paragraphs 5 and onwards. And as to certain of those matters, questions both of law and of admissibility arise in respect of the primary documentation.

…

Could your Honour indicate that if your Honour lists it for the Friday would your Honour direct that counsel, whoever it may be, for the two accused be in touch with Mr Neil well before that date to elicit the issues that might need to be dealt with on that date, so that at least your Honour's associate can be notified of them to work out when Mr Neil might be available or Mr English might be available. We don't wish to exclude either of them from having the opportunity to participate in the pre-trials. It's rather important that those who are conducting the trial sort out the pre-trials.

…

I should indicate to your Honour, too, whilst I've been sitting here I've received a message to indicate that one other senior counsel might also be available for that period so the prospects are improving. I did what I could personally with the clerk.

[Emphasis added.]


	
	Justice Johnson said, of Mr Macdonald’s notice of motion, towards the conclusion of the mention on 1 February 2016:
	


“If the notice of motion is to be heard, the Court expects to be informed of that at the earliest time; the liberty to apply is to be activated, and I will list the motion for hearing urgently on the basis that it clearly needs to be resolved at an early time.”


	
	On that day, the Crown estimated a period of three to six weeks for the Crown case. At the conclusion of the mention in the Arraignments List, Johnson J stood the proceedings over for mention before the trial judge on 17 February 2016.
	
	
	On 1 February 2016 Mr Dan spoke to Steven Doumit from Legal Aid who informed Mr Dan that he could put in a further application for legal aid on behalf of Mr Macdonald. Notwithstanding this conversation, Mr Dan has not put in another application for legal aid.
	
	
	On 12 February 2016 Janet De Castro Lopo of the Department of Justice sent an email to Mr Dan concerning Mr Macdonald’s request for funding and informed him that the Attorney-General would be considering the application on the weekend.
	
	
	By email on 16 February 2016 Ms De Castro Lopo sent an email to Mr Dan advising him that the Attorney-General had considered the matter and declined to provide ex gratia legal assistance to Mr Macdonald for the trial.
	


Mention on 17 February 2016


	
	On 17 February 2016, the mention was listed before me as trial judge. As the question of funding had still not been resolved, I listed Mr Macdonald’s notice of motion for hearing on 23 February 2016.
	
	
	On 17 February 2016 Mr Dan wrote to the Premier of New South Wales, again requesting funding for legal assistance for Mr Macdonald.
	


Hearing date of Dietrich application on 23 February 2016


	
	On 23 February 2016 the accused was represented by Mr Barker QC, who abandoned the application for a stay. He asked the Court to note that the notice of motion had been withdrawn, although he was unable to confirm whether, and by whom, Mr Macdonald would be represented at the trial listed to commence on 14 March 2016. The matter was adjourned for further mention on 1 March 2016.
	


Mention on 1 March 2016


	
	On 1 March 2016 applications were made by Mr Macdonald and Mr Maitland to vacate the trial. The basis for Mr Maitland’s application was that he had been unable to brief counsel because his insurer, although it accepted indemnity, had not been forthcoming with funds. I acceded to Mr Maitland’s application and vacated the trial date and allocated a new trial date of 26 April 2016.
	
	
	On 30 March 2016, Mr Dan was informed by the Premier’s office that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General. On 30 March 2016, Mr Dan briefed Mr Healey of counsel to appear on behalf of Mr Macdonald at a mention before me on 1 April 2016.
	


The filing of a second Dietrich application on 1 April 2016


	
	On 1 April 2016 Mr Healey sought leave on behalf of Mr Macdonald to file in court a notice of motion seeking a stay of the proceedings until the accused had sufficient funding. He was unaware of the previous notice of motion, or that it had been withdrawn, having only been briefed on the afternoon of 30 March 2016. He was not briefed on the motion itself, but was merely briefed to seek leave to file it in Court and apply for it to be adjourned to 26 April 2016 (being the date on which the trial was listed to commence).
	
	
	Mr Dan gave evidence on the hearing of the adjournment application and was cross-examined. He retained a “hope and expectation” that public funding would be forthcoming from the executive government, notwithstanding several refusals of such applications to the Premier and the Attorney-General. On this basis I stood over the hearing of the application to Friday 8 April 2016.
	
	
	Following the hearing on 1 April 2016 Mr Dan rang Ms De Castro Lopo to inform her that Mr Macdonald’s trial had been stood over for further mention to 8 April 2016. He asked her what was happening with Mr Macdonald’s application for funding. She had not heard about the fate of the application but assured him that she would let him know when she did.
	
	
	Mr Dan followed up his request by email on 5 April 2016 to which Ms De Castro Lopo responded on 6 April 2016 by saying that she had not heard anything further. Mr Dan wrote again, by email on 6 April 2016, asking her to make him aware of any further developments. He wrote to her again on 7 April 2016 to which she responded:
	


“I have heard nothing from the Premier or any other source about this matter.”


	
	On 7 April 2016 Mr Dan spoke with an unidentified member of the New South Wales Cabinet concerning potential funding for Mr Macdonald’s legal representation. The following conversation ensued:
	


“On or about 7 April 2016, I spoke with a member of the NSW Cabinet regarding the funding of Mr Macdonald. In that conversation he and I had a conversation to the following effect:

Me: ‘Any update on the funding for Mr Macdonald’.

The member of NSW Cabinet: ‘No not yet. You will have to wait still. You may get an answer later in the month.’

Me: ‘Is that after David Levine puts out his report?’

Member of Cabinet: ‘Yes maybe then’.”


	
	Mr Dan gave evidence that Mr Levine QC is the ICAC Inspector who is currently looking at past ICAC investigations, including into Operations Acacia and Jasper, which dealt with mining activity in the Bilong Valley. In the course of correspondence with Mr Levine, Mr Dan has brought to Mr Levine’s attention matters which Mr Macdonald contended were not adequately considered by ICAC. Although Mr Dan said in evidence that he expects the report (the Levine Report) to be available by the end of April 2016 he accepted that he had not been told that date either by Mr Levine or by anyone associated with the preparation of the report.
	


Adjourned hearing date of 8 April 2016


	
	On 8 April 2016, Mr Mackay of counsel appeared on behalf of Mr Macdonald. He read affidavits of Mr Macdonald and Mr Dan in support of the notice of motion for a stay. In the course of exchanges about practical matters (principally the briefing of counsel for the trial), Mr Mackay said:
	


“I only came into this brief recently. I was briefed in the ICAC hearing and not in the trial. Just for your Honour's knowledge, there are counsel who are willing to represent Mr MacDonald, if funding becomes available, and I am one of those counsel. Certain counsel are willing to reduce their rates, but the problem is that it is a three month trial and several counsel just can't have no money for three months.”


	
	Before the Crown began its cross-examination, Mr Mackay foreshadowed that objection would be taken to the Crown Prosecutor for the trial conducting the cross-examination of the accused on the Dietrich application. Mr Jordan SC, who appeared for the accused Mr Maitland, took the further point that it would tend to infringe Mr Macdonald’s right to silence if the Crown put that he was not in financial difficulties when its own case statement relied on his financial difficulties as providing a motive for the offence with which he stands charged. Neither of these matters had previously been raised with the Crown.
	
	
	In order to consider the matters raised, the Crown sought that the hearing of the notice of motion be adjourned. I adjourned the notice of motion to 13 April 2016.
	


Adjourned hearing of the notice of motion on 13 April 2016


	
	On 13 April 2016, the Crown was represented by Mr Williams of counsel, who is not briefed in the trial (to overcome the objections raised by both accused on 8 April 2016). Mr Mackay, who appeared on behalf of Mr Macdonald, tendered recent tax returns and notices of assessments of Mr Macdonald and his wife, Anita Gylseth. Mr Macdonald gave further evidence in chief and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Until recently, Mr Macdonald made the mortgage payments in full over the Leura Property. He gave the following evidence in his cross-examination on 13 April 2016:
	


Q. Mr Macdonald, even now you make a contribution of $700 a month to the mortgage on that property, don't you?

A. Well, yes, yes, or 600 I think it is now, but we have rearranged it so I don't actually cover the mortgage. At some points I did cover other bits and pieces.

Q. When did you rearrange it, Mr Macdonald?

A. Very recently.

Q. Well, this week, last month?

A. No, a month or two.

Q. After you swore this affidavit [affidavit on 21 January 2016]?

A. Yes.


	
	The Crown put to Mr Macdonald in cross-examination that the DPP had written to Mr Dan in January 2016 to ask for copies of the documents that he had provided to the Legal Aid Commission in support of his application for legal aid. Mr Macdonald agreed that he had refused to provide such documents and that only a small proportion of the documents provided to the Legal Aid Commission had been annexed to his affidavits in support of the Dietrich application.
	
	
	In re-examination of Mr Macdonald, Mr Mackay sought to tender a folder of documents which apparently constituted the documents that Mr Macdonald had provided to the Legal Aid Commission. The Crown objected to the tender on the basis that it had not had an opportunity to see those documents before it concluded the cross-examination of Mr Macdonald. In his re-examination on 13 April 2016, Mr Macdonald expressed his reasons for not providing the material earlier. As it is not at all clear what he meant, I shall set out the exchange in full:
	


Q. Mr Macdonald, what are your reasons for not providing your Legal Aid material to the Court?

A. Well, I didn't think that the material I provided them they specifically asked for and requested and I didn't believe that, given that it was relevant to a very specific situation to put it in at this point, there is nothing in it that is different than that's here, in reality.


	
	On 13 April 2016 I adjourned the motion to 20 April 2016 to permit the Crown to cross-examine Mr Macdonald on the documents sought to be tendered and indicated that the documents should be identified by Mr Macdonald in an affidavit which could accompany their tender.
	
	
	Against the background of these proceedings, Mr Macdonald has continued to work in his consultancy business. He gave evidence, in “re-examination” on 20 April 2016 of recent activities such as the following.
	
	
	On Sunday 17 April 2016 Mr Macdonald received a telephone call from a “middle person” acting on behalf of an investor who was interested in a family vineyard located in the central west of New South Wales. The terms of his commission which is payable on settlement of the sale, if it eventuates, are that he will be paid in the order of $60,000 (pre-tax). Contracts are not yet exchanged; the settlement period is 10 weeks. Mr Macdonald would expect to be paid about a fortnight after settlement.
	
	
	On Monday 18 April 2016 Mr Macdonald took a delegation of Chinese businessmen from a “large southern Chinese company” to the central west of New South Wales to look at a winery and vineyard. If the investment materialises, Mr Macdonald expects to receive an amount in the order of $160,000. He will not know for a period of at least two months whether it will go ahead, although he had an arrangement to meet them on the evening of 20 April 2016 and described their trip as “a pretty successful visit”.
	
	
	Neither Mr Macdonald’s further affidavit nor the folder of documents that contained the Legal Aid bundle was provided to the Crown until 10.30am on 19 April 2016, the day before the adjourned hearing, although the folder of documents had been in court on 13 April 2016.
	
	
	On 19 April 2016 Mr Dan rang Ms De Castro Lopo and left a voicemail message. He sent her an email asking for an update before 9.15am when the matter was again listed for hearing. None was forthcoming.
	
	
	On 19 April 2016, at 3.26pm, Mr Dan rang Mr Doumit from the Legal Aid Commission. As there was no answer, he left a message for him about submitting a further application for legal aid. Mr Doumit returned Mr Dan’s call at 7.30am on 20 April 2016. Mr Doumit told him that there was no reason why he could not put in a further application for legal aid for Mr Macdonald. Mr Dan asked whether it was still the policy that there would only be one counsel for Mr Macdonald. Mr Doumit confirmed that to be the case.
	


Adjourned hearing of notice of motion on 20 April 2016


	
	At the adjourned hearing of the notice of motion, Mr Brady SC appeared with Mr Mackay for Mr Macdonald, who gave further evidence in chief both orally and on affidavit. In his affidavit of 19 April 2016 (which was read at the resumed hearing on 20 April 2016) Mr Macdonald gave the following reason for not having disclosed the material provided to Legal Aid earlier:
	


I did not disclose this material to the Department of Public Prosecutions previously for two main reasons. First I was concerned about my and my wife, wife’s privacy and the possible leaking of the information to the media. During the ICAC hearings on a number of occasions my financial details were disclosed inaccurately in the media. The publication of my personal finances during ICAC had a detrimental effect on my consultancy work. Second included in the documents is a confidential payment in relation to defamation proceedings which are the subject of deed and release and confidentiality.


	
	Mr Macdonald gave evidence that, on Friday 15 April 2016, he telephoned the National Australia Bank and asked for a loan of $250,000 for legal fees. He gave details of his income. The bank officer responded by saying that if the bank were to lend the money it would insist on being the first registered mortgagee, which would require the first mortgage of $150,000 to be refinanced. The bank officer indicated that the bank would not be prepared to lend $400,000 because Mr Macdonald’s income was insufficient to service the loan. This is the only evidence of any application for finance for legal fees having been made by or on behalf of Mr Macdonald.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald, for the first time on 20 April 2016 in re-examination (in respect of which I gave the Crown leave to cross-examine), gave evidence of further matters in respect of which he had a prospect of earning fees. Some of these matters are referred to above. He also gave evidence of a feasibility study regarding exporting of chilled forequarters to China. Mr Macdonald said that he had no consultancy fee structured for that project. He also mentioned “various mineral projects” which will be the subject of presentations which he will be doing on Friday and over this coming weekend. When asked if there were any other projects he answered:
	


Well, I'm working on a lot of things. I've secured lobster imports or exports to China; I've secured salmon but these haven't commenced yet, I've just got agreement from various companies that they will supply. Abalone, oranges and, subject to one of my contacts who is already in China in discussions with a number of groups in relation to supply, I would receive a small amount monthly from that. This is not ‑ this trade side, or commodities side, is not a great big pot of gold.

Q. What's a small amount?

A. $1,400 a month, that sort of thing.


	
	In further cross-examination, the following exchange occurred between the Crown and Mr Macdonald as to Mr Macdonald’s business projects:
	


Q. The details of these, so far as you are concerned, are a matter of agreement between you and the people involved?

A. That's correct.

Q. None of those agreements with anybody are before the Court, are they?

A. Well that's true. That's correct.

The two applications


	
	Mr Brady confirmed that, in the alternative to Mr Macdonald’s Dietrich application, his client sought an adjournment on the basis that, if further time were allowed, there would be a real prospect that his client would be able to obtain funding for legal representation at the trial.
	


The Dietrich application


	
	In Dietrich v The Queen Mason CJ and McHugh J, at 315, set out the approach to be adopted in the following terms:
	


“In view of the differences in the reasoning of the members of the court constituting the majority in the present case, it is desirable that, at the risk of some repetition, we identify what the majority considers to be the approach which should be adopted by a trial judge who is faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an indigent accused charged with a serious offence who, through no fault on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation. In that situation, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the trial in such a case should be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation is available. If, in those circumstances, an application that the trial be delayed is refused and, by reason of the lack of representation of the accused, the resulting trial is not a fair one, any conviction of the accused must be quashed by an appellate court for the reason that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the accused has been convicted without a fair trial.”


	
	The notion of “fault” was considered in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163. The High Court set out the passage from Dietrich v The Queen set out above and then said, at 184-185 (footnotes omitted):
	


The decision of this Court in Dietrich v The Queen [83] established that, in a criminal case where an unrepresented accused is facing trial for serious offences, a trial judge has power to make an order staying the proceedings if, in the circumstances of the case, it appears that the accused would otherwise not receive a fair trial. In the course of their joint judgment, Mason CJ and McHugh J made the following comments as reflecting their approach and that of the other majority Justices [84]:

“… we identify what the majority considers to be the approach which should be adopted by a trial judge who is faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an indigent accused charged with a serious offence who, through no fault on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation. In that situation, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the trial in such a case should be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation is available.”

The effect of those comments was to indicate circumstances in which a trial judge should grant an adjournment or stay until legal representation was available. The reference in them to an accused's inability to obtain legal representation being “through no fault on his or her part” was not intended to indicate that every instance of misbehaviour, improvidence or other fault on the part of an accused which had contributed to his or her lack of representation must automatically preclude entitlement to a stay. In that regard, we agree with the view expressed by Olsson J in the Full Court that:

“ … what was in contemplation was a test which focused on the reasonableness of the conduct of an accused in all of the circumstances; and excluded situations in which it could fairly be said that the accused, by his gratuitous and unreasonable conduct, had been the author of his own misfortune.”

A fortiori, it was not intended to suggest that the power to grant a stay on the grounds of inability to obtain legal representation does not exist at all if there has been, as a matter of objective fact, contributing fault on the part of the accused.


	
	I have been referred to a number of decisions in which Dietrich v The Queen has been considered and applied. For example, in R v Joyce, [2003] NSWCCA 280 Shaw J (Tobias JA and Howie J agreeing) said at [23] that it should not be considered necessary that a person change their home to pay their legal expenses when charged with criminal offences. An accused person does not need to show penury, as opposed to indigence: R v Marchi, Marchi and Mead (1996) 91 Crim R 112 at 118 per Perry J. If the value of an accused’s assets and income falls well short of what is required to conduct a trial he is to be regarded as indigent for the purposes of a Dietrich application.
	
	
	The applicant Mr Macdonald submitted that, in accordance with the principles in Dietrich v The Queen, his trial ought be stayed as he is unable to afford legal representation.
	
	
	It is common ground that Mr Macdonald has been charged with a serious offence and that the trial will be both lengthy (the Crown case is estimated to take between three and six weeks if both accused are legally represented) and complex. The questions are whether he has shown both that he is indigent and that he is unable, through no fault of his own, to obtain legal representation.
	


Whether Mr Macdonald has shown that he is indigent


	
	I am not satisfied that Mr Macdonald is indigent, largely because I am not persuaded that he has been forthcoming with details of his financial circumstances. Although the Crown has been able to piece together such evidence as is publicly available (such as from title searches and the like) of his asset position, there are significant limits to its capacity to ascertain the true position.
	
	
	An instance of this reluctance to disclose his true financial position is afforded by Mr Macdonald’s refusal to provide to the Crown the material he had provided to the Legal Aid Commission. Indeed, Mr Macdonald gave evidence on 20 April 2016 that it had been tendered by Mr Mackay on 13 April 2016 without his instructions (although the folder was in court at the time). He gave two different reasons for refusing to provide it to the DPP: the first orally on 13 April 2016 (that they had not really asked for it and that it did not really provide different information from what they already had); and the second in an affidavit of 19 April 2016 (that he was concerned about confidentiality).
	
	
	The second reason given was itself problematic. Mr Macdonald admitted in further cross-examination (on 20 April 2016) that there was no difference between the nature of the documents that had already been disclosed (in the evidence in support of his Dietrich application) and the documents that were contained in the Legal Aid bundle since both categories included bank statements, details about his wife’s superannuation affairs, their tax returns and their property dealings.
	
	
	Another example of Mr Macdonald’s unwillingness to be frank about his financial position in the absence of a pressing financial imperative is provided by the disclosure, in his affidavit of 19 April 2016, of the receipt of a sum of $20,000 as a result of defamation proceedings he had brought that were settled. The bank statement recording the receipt of that amount was contained in the Legal Aid bundle and had been the subject of a query by Legal Aid made by letter dated 30 June 2015. I am not confident that the receipt of that sum would have been disclosed by Mr Macdonald but for the tender of the Legal Aid bundle which I infer caused Mr Macdonald to believe that there was a risk that he would be asked about the payment.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald did not reveal the existence of the family trust he set up in 2010 in this application. It became known to the Crown through the tender of the Legal Aid bundle. He was asked about it in the following exchange in cross-examination:
	


Q. Mr Macdonald, you established a family trust in 2010?

A. Yes.

Q. You've not put before the Court the trust deed with respect to that family trust, have you?

A. I don't believe I had. It was held by my solicitor at the time, it has never been used and I don't have access to the documents.

Q. Have you asked for them in the context of this application?

A. No I haven't.


	
	Although Mr Macdonald accepted that his wife owned shares, he did not adduce any evidence to show his wife’s shareholdings.
	
	
	Although Mr Macdonald has no obligation to be frank with the Court, and there is no analogy with the Crown’s obligation of disclosure, he bears an onus on a Dietrich application. He has not, in my view, been forthcoming about his financial affairs (or indeed his attempts to find legal representation). My impression is that he has repeatedly tried to paint an incomplete picture of his financial affairs by refusing to produce the Legal Aid bundle to the Crown until his re-examination on 13 April 2016 (and giving a spurious and almost incomprehensible reason for his refusal) and refusing to set out in an open way, what his true financial position is. That the bundle was not served until less than 24 hours prior to the resumed hearing is a further indication of his reluctance to have his true financial position revealed or investigated.
	
	
	In his affidavit of 21 January 2016, Mr Macdonald deposed that he had no assets. However, his counsel properly conceded in written submissions that he has an equitable interest in his wife’s property. He accepted that if his share is a half share, the value of his interest is of the order of $256,000 (without making any allowance for his unsecured debts).
	
	
	Furthermore, I consider that Mr Macdonald has tended to use counsel as his mouthpiece in situations where each counsel briefed (by reason of the cameo nature of each appearance and the late instructions) has only limited knowledge of the matter and therefore is unable to assist the Court to answer questions outside the limited brief. For example, Mr Healey was briefed to come to Court on 1 April 2016 to file a Dietrich application and to have it adjourned. He did not know that a previous Dietrich application had been filed on 21 January 2016, or that it had been withdrawn by Mr Barker on 23 February 2016. Nor did he know the basis of the Dietrich application. Mr Brady appeared to lead Mr Mackay on the final day of the application although he had never appeared previously. In making this observation I make no criticism of the various counsel who have appeared (apparently on a pro bono basis) on behalf of Mr Macdonald.
	
	
	A further example of Mr Macdonald’s use of counsel and failure to adduce relevant evidence appears from the extract from the transcript on 1 February 2016. Mr Greg James QC told Johnson J:
	


“There has been a series of conferences conducted by my instructing solicitor on Friday and over the weekend. They have culminated in a conference early this morning in which a strong prospect has arisen of his being able to achieve a fixed sum of funds such that Mr Ramage would be, if briefed, able to be briefed for a four week trial.”


	
	Mr Dan accepted in cross-examination that nowhere in Mr Macdonald’s evidence in support of his Dietrich application has the following been revealed: the identity of potential funders; the basis on which the funding would be provided; the amount of funding; or the result of any such arrangement. I assume that Mr James made the representation set out above on the basis of his then instructions and that those instructions were provided by Mr Dan and Mr Macdonald. This is another instance of Mr Macdonald not being prepared to disclose to the Court the true position or to give details to enable his general statements, either to be investigated by the Crown or to be weighed and assessed by the Court.
	
	
	Until 20 April 2016 all that Mr Macdonald was prepared to tell the Court about his work is that it is “success-based” and that he had not been paid since October 2015. On 20 April 2016, when it was too late for the Crown to investigate any of his evidence, he gave extravagant descriptions of his recent meetings, the projects involved, the prospects of success, the range of his activities and his role in each project. The timing of this evidence and the fact that not a single document associated with any one of these projects was tendered are further indications of Mr Macdonald’s reluctance to disclose his true financial position.
	
	
	The evidence of the loan from Mr Gerathy is wholly unsatisfactory. The written submissions made on behalf of Mr Macdonald referred to the loan as “a personal loan for approximately $200,000”. On the evidence, I could not conclude that it is a liability at all, or that its terms are not void for uncertainty. But for Mr Crown’s cross-examination, I would have been left with a misleading impression as to both the enforceability and quantum of the loan.
	
	
	In summary, for the reasons given above, I am not satisfied that Mr Macdonald has established that he is indigent since his financial position has not been sufficiently disclosed to permit such a judgment to be made. That he has refrained from disclosing, or delayed the disclosure of so many matters, leaves open the inference that he has available funds but is unwilling to reveal them, lest he be required (by the executive government, by the Legal Aid Commission, or by this Court) to employ them in his defence, if he is to be represented at all.
	


Whether Mr Macdonald has shown that he is unable to obtain legal representation


	
	According to Mr Macdonald, he has been endeavouring since the publication of the ICAC Report (in August 2013) to obtain counsel to represent him. No counsel has been located who has been prepared to act for Mr Macdonald pro bono in the trial. To date he has not paid any of his legal advisers and has only received one invoice from a barrister.
	
	
	Although both Mr Macdonald and Mr Dan have deposed that there have been discussions with a number of barristers with a view to their being retained to appear on Mr Macdonald’s behalf at the trial, no details of such discussions have been included in the evidence: neither names, nor terms, nor availability, nor instructions as to how long the trial would be. Nor has any such enquiry been made on any basis that does not involve the briefing of senior counsel.
	
	
	Although Mr Macdonald applied for legal aid, which was refused, there was nothing stopping him from making another application. If he or Mr Dan was not aware of that circumstance before, Mr Dan was specifically informed of the policy on 1 February 2016 and yet no further application was made. Nor is there any evidence that Mr Macdonald has ever offered to make a contribution to the Legal Aid Commission towards his legal representation, whether by way of present funds or commitment from future earnings, if and when they are received.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the asserted difficulties Mr Macdonald has had in securing counsel to appear for him at trial, he has been represented whenever his matter has been before the Court, and in some cases by senior counsel (as referred to in the procedural history set out above). Only rarely has the same barrister appeared for him more than once (the forensic consequences of this have already been mentioned). Mr Dan has been present throughout. Mr Dan did not give evidence that he would cease to act on Mr Macdonald’s behalf if counsel was not briefed at the trial. However, Mr Brady informed me from the bar table that, in this event, this is what Mr Dan would do.

	I note that no application has been made either to the New South Wales Law Society pro bono scheme, or to the New South Wales Bar Association Legal Assistance Referral Scheme. I accept the statements from the bar table that such an application would be likely to be futile, having regard to the length of the trial. Accordingly, I draw no adverse inference against Mr Macdonald arising from his not having made such applications.
	


The legal costs of the likely proceedings


	
	Various estimates have been given by Mr Macdonald for the likely cost of legal representation in the trial, ranging from, at the highest end, $420,000 (exclusive of GST) (based on a three-week trial plus preparation with senior counsel at $10,000 per day and junior counsel at $2,000 per day and the solicitor at $3,000), at a weekly cost (once the trial is underway) of $75,000 and, at the low end, legal aid rates for senior counsel and a solicitor at $12,600 per week.
	
	
	No evidence has been given about details of any negotiations with counsel to appear for a fixed fee. There is no evidence, for example, about the fee which Mr Mackay (who appeared for Mr Macdonald at in the ICAC inquiry and who could be expected to be broadly familiar with the material) would charge to appear at the trial. I note his willingness to do so, as indicated by his statement from the bar table on 8 April 2016 which is set out above. Even if he were not to be identified in such evidence except by seniority and familiarity with the matter, I would have expected evidence of that particularity to be forthcoming rather than general statements as to attempts made, the weight of which could not be assessed by reason of their generality.
	


Attempts to obtain finance for legal representation


	
	Until last Friday (15 April 2016) Mr Macdonald had not made any attempt to borrow money since the ICAC inquiry commenced. I do not regard this application to have been a serious attempt to obtain funding, as opposed to a last-minute, and colourable, attempt to remedy an evidentiary deficiency in his application.
	
	
	Mr Macdonald has not given evidence that he has asked his wife whether the house in her name (which was substantially, if not wholly, purchased with funds generated by him) could be used to secure a loan to fund legal representation (although it is possible to infer that she is happy for this to occur if his phone call to the National Australia Bank last Friday asking for a loan was made with her consent). He has not called her to give evidence in support of his Dietrich application.
	
	
	As far as the evidence reveals, all that Mr Macdonald has done to obtain funding for legal representation is: to make an application to the Legal Aid Commission for legal aid; to make applications to the Premier and Attorney-General for public funds to be applied to his legal representation; to ask (through Mr Dan) barristers to act for him pro bono; and to set up a website to raise funds from the public. Although there appear to have been some discussions with “funders” (as represented by Mr James to the Court on 1 February 2016), the evidence does not reveal anything about these discussions or the identity of the funders. Accordingly it is not possible to take the matter further.
	
	
	Dietrich v The Queen establishes that criminal proceedings ought, in some circumstances, be stayed where a person accused of a serious crime is indigent and who is, through no fault of his or her own, thereby unable to obtain legal representation. I have taken into account what was said by the High Court in Craig v South Australia about fault and the circumstance that Mr Macdonald is not, by the refusal of his application, to be punished for dilatoriness or, as the Crown put it, “putting his head in the sand”. However, Mr Macdonald has not established that he is indigent. He has not established that the reason he has not been able to obtain legal representation is not his fault. All that has really been established is that he wants someone else to pay for his trial and that he is not prepared to disclose to the Court either his true financial situation or the details of any negotiations with lawyers.
	
	
	Accordingly, the Dietrich application is refused.
	


The adjournment application


	
	In the alternative, Mr Brady sought that the matter be adjourned for three months to permit Mr Macdonald to access sources of funding. He relied on the principles referred to by Barr AJ in R v Yuill (unreported, 1 November 1993, page 23) where his Honour said (prior to rejecting Mr Yuill’s application for an adjournment):
	


“The notice of motion as amended asks for orders in each proceedings that the trial be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation is available. There may be cases where a distinction may be drawn between an adjournment, a postponement or a stay. There might be evidence, for example, that money might become available in some identifiable time in the future to enable legal representation to be provided, and that might justify an adjournment of the trial to a particular time.”


	
	He submitted that the executive government might well change its mind if the Levine Report is critical of ICAC’s investigations in Operation Jasper which led to the recommendation in respect of Mr Macdonald and the finding against him. Mr Brady pointed to the circumstance that the latest application to executive government had not expressly been refused but remained “on the table” and contended that this indicated a preparedness on the part of the executive government to change its mind.
	
	
	Mr Brady also contended that a further application could be made to Legal Aid, the fate of which could be different since the first application was refused on the basis of discretionary expenditure, which was limited to a particular period of time.
	
	
	Mr Brady also submitted that, having regard to Mr Macdonald’s work, there was some prospect of his financial situation improving to a sufficient extent in the short to medium term so as to permit him to fund legal representation.
	
	
	Mr Brady submitted that, in these circumstances, the interests of justice wholly favoured the granting of an adjournment so that any prospect of legal representation could be fully explored
	
	
	Mr Macdonald’s Dietrich application and his application for an adjournment were wholly supported by Mr Jordan. Both Mr Brady and Mr Jordan outlined in detail the difficulties that would be encountered if Mr Macdonald were to represent himself. They predicted the probable doubling of the length of the trial; the almost inevitability of a jury, or more than one jury, having to be discharged; the increased cost and time associated with these matters; the risk that Mr Maitland’s fair trial could be compromised by Mr Macdonald not being represented. They referred, too, to the difficulties of Mr Macdonald cross-examining former colleagues as well as political foes. They also relied on the substantial differences in the standards for acceptable and appropriate behaviour in court and in Parliament as a reason why Mr Macdonald could not have a fair trial if he represented himself.
	
	
	I accept that there is a substantial difference between an application for a stay of a criminal trial and an application for an adjournment. The former is an exceptional order; the circumstances in which it is granted, although not limited, tend to be confined to specific categories, such as in Dietrich itself. An adjournment, by contrast, requires a different discretionary judgment to be made. In the main, an application for an adjournment requires the Court to consider what is to be gained and what is to be lost by a trial not starting at the allocated date and balancing those matters, paying due regard to relevant considerations of which the most important is the administration of justice (which in turn includes the concept of a fair trial).
	
	
	The reservations I have about granting an adjournment derive from the narrative set out above, which reveals a litany of instances where adjournments have been sought on behalf of Mr Macdonald for apparently good reasons. Notwithstanding indulgence after indulgence, almost a year has passed since Mr Macdonald was arraigned on 8 May 2015 and he appears to be no closer to readying himself for his trial. His several attempts to defer both the trial and the identification (much less the determination) of pre-trial matters are wholly at odds with his avowed willingness to stand trial to vindicate his name.
	
	
	When Mr James appeared before the Court on 1 February 2016 he made several representations, which I assume to be on instructions, to the effect of work that had been done both to obtain funding and prepare the case. He made specific reference to the size of the Crown bundle and the work that had been done to cull it and his own contribution to the process. It now appears that none of this was to any effect.
	
	
	I have no confidence that Mr Macdonald’s belief that executive government will change its mind about funding if Mr Levine is critical of ICAC’s handling of Operation Jasper is well-founded. Although the scenario postulated by Mr Brady is a possibility, there are several others, including that the executive government will continue to refuse to fund the trial, as it has done several times in the past. That Mr Hazzard refused the application for funding on the ground that there had been a finding (by ICAC) of corrupt conduct is no indication that the executive government (as presently constituted) has refused further applications for the same reason. Mr Levine has no power to quash ICAC’s finding or reverse its recommendations (which have, in the present case, been implemented in any event by the referral to the DPP and the presenting of the indictment). Nor does the absence of definitive response to Mr Macdonald’s recent application provide any grounds for optimism. The executive government is presumably aware that the trial was listed on 14 March 2016 and then adjourned to commence on 26 April 2016.
	
	
	As for a further application for legal aid, Mr Macdonald’s delay in making another application would tend to suggest that his assessment of his prospects of obtaining legal aid has not changed markedly since his last application. It is also consistent with a reluctance to provide full disclosure of his financial affairs. He has known since at least 1 February 2016 that the refusal of his last application did not foreclose a further application and has made none. Furthermore, the reasons given by the Legal Aid Review Committee set out above show that the refusal of legal aid was not solely based on “discretionary expenditure”. Accordingly, it would not appear that Mr Macdonald’s prospects would materially increase if, for example, his wife did not travel overseas. I accept the Crown’s submission that the best evidence of Mr Macdonald’s belief that legal aid would be granted if a further application were made would have been for him to make a timely application. He has not done so.
	
	
	Nor do I consider it appropriate to adjourn the proceedings on the basis that Mr Macdonald’s metaphorical ship will come in as far as the various projects in respect of which he hopes for a success fee. He has chosen not to favour this Court with a single document to corroborate his various dealings. Even if he were to receive more funds I am not satisfied that he would apply them to his legal defence anyway. If his future income could be quantified and predicted, he might be able to charge it to secure a loan, or make a contribution to legal aid (or undertake to do so). There is no evidence that he has explored any such means of funding.
	
	
	The following extract from Barr AJ’s judgment R v Yuill is apposite to the present application and ought, in my view, suffer a similar fate:
	


“But there is no evidence to show that the circumstances of the applicant or the attitude of the applicant or Mrs Yuill are likely to change in the future and no practical distinction arises between an adjournment, a postponement or a stay in this case. I refuse to adjourn or postpone the commencement of either of the trials. I refuse to stay either of the indictments.”


	
	I accept the submissions of Mr Brady and Mr Jordan about the difficulties of conducting this trial if Mr Macdonald is unrepresented and the risk that Mr Maitland’s interests will thereby be compromised. The spectre of conducting a trial such as the present with the principal accused unrepresented is not an attractive one. These are very substantial matters which weigh in favour of adjourning the trial.
	
	
	Nonetheless I have no confidence that the situation will be any different were I to adjourn the trial for three months, as suggested. Past adjournments have only brought further applications. There is therefore no utility in adjourning the trial since an adjournment would be likely to do no more than produce another application in three months’ time.
	


Orders


	
	For the foregoing reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Dismiss the notice of motion filed by Mr Macdonald on 1 April 2016.
	
	
	Refuse the application for adjournment of the trial.

2701725,R v Jame PHAN (also known as Van Linh DANG) [2016] NSWSC 483,"REASONS FOR SENTENCE


	
	MATHEWS AJ:
	


Introduction


	
	On 8 October 2015 Lance Murdoch and Van Linh Dang (who prefers to be called Jame Phan) were indicted on two charges: first that on 12 October 2013 they murdered Kamran Yousaf; second, that on the same date they robbed Dianne Torro of a sum of cash while armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a pistol. Mr Murdoch pleaded not guilty to both charges. Mr Phan pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, and guilty to the charge of armed robbery. A jury was duly empanelled, and a trial proceeded in relation to the charges to which the particular accused had pleaded not guilty. On 29 October the jury returned a verdict of guilty in relation to each of those charges.
	
	
	Accordingly, both men are to be sentenced in relation to those charges. However the sentencing proceedings in relation to Mr Murdoch have been adjourned for a lengthy time. Accordingly, all parties have agreed that it would be appropriate to continue with the sentencing of Mr Phan, as quite different considerations apply in relation to each of the two men.
	
	
	Mr Phan had already pleaded guilty to three further charges of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon in relation to offences which were committed on 5, 7 and 10 October 2013. He is accordingly to be sentenced in relation to all five offences.
	


Circumstances of the Offences


	
	I shall first describe the two offences which were the subject of the trial. They arose out of the same incident, which took place at the Villawood Fruit Market on the afternoon of Saturday 12 October 2013. The deceased, Mr Yousaf, was an employee at the store. At about 3.30 that afternoon two men arrived at the store, entering through the rear lane. They had surgical masks covering the lower part of their faces and were wearing hooded tops, with the hoods covering their heads, so that most of their faces were concealed. They were also wearing high visibility yellow vests, of the type that workmen often wear. One of them was wielding a hammer, and the other a small silver pistol. Two employees of the market were having lunch in the back lane, outside the rear entrance to the shop, when these two men approached them and demanded to be taken inside and to the till.
	
	
	The following account is a very brief encapsulation of a great deal of detailed evidence which was given at the trial by a number of witnesses, who were store employees, people who worked nearby, and members of the public who happened to be in or near the store at the time. As is often the case in relation to events which happen quickly and unexpectedly, there were a number of differences in the details of their descriptions. However there was general agreement as to the overall course of events after the two men came into the store. One thing we now know with absolute certainty is that the man with the hammer was the offender Phan; and the gun man, as the jury’s verdict confirms, was the offender Lance Murdoch. Henceforth, therefore, I will be referring to them by name.
	
	
	Having entered the store through the rear entrance, the two men demanded to be taken to the till. Once there, Mr Murdoch demanded that one of the employees give him the till. She refused to do so. Very shortly afterwards Mr Phan jumped into the other till register area and reefed out one of the two tills. He was running towards the rear of the store, holding both the till and the hammer, when Mr Yousaf grabbed him from behind. At one stage during the confrontation which followed, Mr Phan struck Mr Yousaf’s forehead with the hammer, causing a laceration to the left side of his head. Unfortunately for Mr Yousaf, that was the least of the injuries he sustained during this episode. They were already in the rear lane outside the shop, and Mr Yousaf was holding Mr Phan from behind, with his arms around his waist, when Mr Murdoch, who had run on ahead, returned and fired a shot at him. At that time Mr Phan was leaning forwards and down, so that the upper part of Mr Yousaf’s body was exposed from the front. As the post mortem report later showed, the bullet entered his right, mid abdomen and caused extensive internal injuries. It was estimated to have been fired at very close range, namely from a distance of between 10 centimetres and a metre.
	
	
	In spite of the seriousness of this injury, Mr Yousaf remained upright for some little time after this, and maintained his grip on Mr Phan. He was assisted in this by a customer who had been in the store, and also by one of the other workers. Mr Yousaf was trying to get Mr Phan back inside the shop when Mr Murdoch, who had run down the lane away from the shop, returned and shot at him again. On this occasion the bullet entered Mr Yousaf’s lower back, passed through soft tissue, and lodged within the bone of the mid sacrum. These two wounds, which caused extensive internal bleeding, constituted the immediate cause of Mr Yousaf’s death.
	
	
	Mr Phan had been forced back inside the store, and the rear shutter door had been closed, when Mr Yousaf collapsed. All subsequent attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. By that time Mr Phan had been tied up and was lying on the ground. The police arrived shortly afterwards and Mr Phan was arrested and taken into custody. He declined to enter into an interview with the police.
	
	
	As to Mr Murdoch, after shooting Mr Yousaf the second time, he ran down the rear lane, but returned shortly afterwards and fired a third shot, which did not strike anyone. He then ran away from the area. He was not arrested until some time later.
	
	
	The issues raised at the trial were quite different in relation to each of the two accused. The sole issue in relation to Mr Murdoch was that of identification. The jury’s verdict means that it found this matter proved to the requisite degree.
	
	
	Identification, of course, was never an issue in relation to Mr Phan, who was apprehended at the scene. Hence his plea of guilty to the charge of armed robbery. His defence to the murder charge, was, effectively, that the Crown could not prove that he knew that Mr Murdoch would fire the gun. Therefore he could not bear accessorial liability for the killing of Mr Yousaf. Mr Phan was initially represented at the trial by counsel, but towards the end of the trial he took it upon himself to sack his counsel, despite being warned that this would leave him, at that late stage, without legal representation for the remainder of the trial. He did not give evidence in his own case, nor did he address the jury at the end of the trial. Nevertheless, the jury was thoroughly apprised of the issues in relation to the case against him.
	
	
	At this point it is pertinent to refer to the issues which were left to the jury in relation to the murder charge against Mr Phan, for this is highly relevant to his level of culpability.
	
	
	There were two bases upon which the jury could have found Mr Phan guilty of murder. They were: first, that he was part of a joint enterprise with Mr Murdock to rob the store, and he foresaw the possibility of the gun being discharged, thereby causing death or grievous bodily harm; and secondly that it was a felony murder (or constructive murder), in that the gun was fired during or immediately after the commission of the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, being an offence punishable by imprisonment for 25 years.
	
	
	In the event, the questions asked by the jury made it clear which scenario they accepted in this case. It was an extremely conscientious jury, who deliberated for two days before reaching its verdict. In the meantime they asked a number of questions from which it became obvious that they were concerned about whether the Crown had to prove that Mr Phan foresaw the possibility of Mr Murdoch using the gun to kill or injure someone, or whether it was sufficient to prove that he foresaw the possibility of the gun being fired for other purposes, such as a warning shot. Given that an intention to kill or inflict injury is not an essential element in felony murder, the jury was told that Mr Phan could be guilty of murder notwithstanding that he did not foresee the consequences of the firing of the gun, so long as he foresaw the possibility of the gun being discharged. Very shortly after being given this direction, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty against both men.
	
	
	Given this sequence of events, I have no doubt that the jury convicted Mr Phan on the basis that he foresaw the possibility of Mr Murdoch firing the gun at some stage during or immediately after the armed robbery, but did not foresee the possibility of someone being injured or killed as a result. This very significantly reduces his culpability for this offence, as I shall discuss a little later.
	
	
	Mr Phan is also to be sentenced for the three offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon which were committed in the week preceding the offences which were the subject of the trial. I shall briefly set out the facts of each of them.
	
	
	The first in point of time took place on 5 October 2013. At 10.00 that evening Mr Phan and a co-offender entered the Subway Restaurant in Fairfield East. The co-offender was armed with a small hand pistol. Both men had their faces covered by masks. The co-offender demanded to be shown where the till was. He then took the entire contents of the till, being an unspecified amount of cash, and the two of them ran from the premises and left the area. The entire offence was recorded on CCTV within the premises.
	
	
	The next offence took place two days later, on 7 October 2013. At 3.26 that afternoon Mr Phan and a co-offender entered the Food Works shop in Homebush. Both had had their faces covered by what was described as a ‘surgical mask’, and the co-offender was carrying a small pistol. The co-offender demanded to be given the cash. An employee opened the cash register, and Mr Phan removed the cash from it while the co-offender stole a quantity of cigarettes. The two of them then left. The employee estimated that approximately $2,000 in cash was stolen.
	
	
	The third offence took place on 10 October 2013. At 9.30 that evening Mr Phan and a co-offender entered the Spring Gardens Chinese Restaurant in Georges Hall. Yet again the co-offender was carrying a small hand gun and their faces were covered by masks. The co-offender demanded to be shown the money. Mr Phan then removed the two cash register trays and the offenders ran from the restaurant. The empty cash register trays were later found in Mr Phan’s home, under his bed. An estimated $900 - $1,000 in cash was stolen in this offence.
	
	
	As can be seen, there is a striking similarity between the circumstances of each of these offences. Apart from one significant difference, they are also very similar to the Villawood Fruit Market robbery, at least up to the point when Mr Phan was apprehended by the extremely courageous Mr Yousaf. The additional factor in the last robbery is that Mr Phan himself was armed with a hammer on that occasion. In the previous robberies the only apparent weapon was the pistol which was carried by the co-offender. One of the witnesses described Mr Phan as also carrying a pistol during one of the earlier robberies, but this was not borne out by the CCTV footage.
	


Objective Seriousness of these Offences


	
	In relation to the murder of Mr Yousaf, It is accepted that Mr Phan’s conviction of this offence was almost certainly on the basis of constructive murder. The Crown referred to R v Jacobs and Mehajer (2004) 151 A Crim R 452, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal said that constructive murder should not be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than other categories of murder. The Court went on to say that, as in all categories of murder, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder.
	
	
	That is undoubtedly the case, but in Mr Phan’s case there is a further layer to be considered, namely that he is only liable for Mr Yousaf’s murder by reason of accessorial liability. The sequence of events at the trial clearly showed, as already mentioned, that the jury convicted Mr Phan on the basis that he foresaw the possibility of the gun being discharged by Mr Murdoch, but did not foresee the possibility of someone being injured or killed as a result. This is an extremely important matter on sentence, as it very significantly reduces Mr Phan’s culpability for the murder of Mr Yousaf. It means that, in his case, the killing was, in a real sense, an extension of the offence of armed robbery, albeit an extension which involved the taking of an innocent human life, and was therefore of an inherently extremely serious nature.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of murder there are no aggravating or mitigating factors under s.21A (2) or (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) which are not inherent in the nature of the offence. Certainly the killing was committed in company, in that it was committed by Mr Phan’s co-offender. But it was this very factor which made Mr Phan responsible in law for this offence. Therefore it cannot also be used as an aggravating factor in his case.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I consider that in Mr Phan’s case the objective criminality involved in this offence is of a very low order for the crime of murder. His guilt of this offence is based on two legal constructs, namely felony murder and accessorial liability. I can safely say that in my long experience of murder trials his is the lowest level of culpability that I have ever encountered.
	
	
	The situation in relation to the four armed robbery charges is quite different. As the Crown rightly submits, the level of pre-planning for each of these offences was high. On each occasion the two offenders were wearing masks, and the co-offender was armed with a pistol. There is some disparity between the description of the firearm in the facts submitted by the Crown and those relied on by the defence, but I do not regard this as a matter of particular significance.
	
	
	I turn to the aggravating factors specified in s. 21A (2) of the Act, in relation to the robbery offences. The factors which are relevant here, which are not inherent in the nature of the offences, are as follows. In relation to all offences, s. 21A(2)(e) applies, in that they were committed in company. As the Crown submissions point out, on each occasion the two offenders acted in a coordinated manner, confronting the bystanders and victims with the force of their number, often with one controlling the witnesses while the other removed the property. In relation to the robbery at the Villawood Fruit market on 12 October, two further factors apply: first, pursuant to s.21A(c), the offence involved the threatened use of a weapon, namely the hammer wielded by Mr Phan. This is not inherent in the nature of the offence, as the aggravating factor which brought the robbery offences within the purview of s.97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is the fact that a firearm was involved. Also, pursuant to s. 21A(ea), the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18. An 11 year old girl was present in the shop during this robbery. She gave evidence by video link in the trial.
	
	
	It is to be remembered that the four offences to which Mr Phan has pleaded guilty are of aggravated armed robbery, and therefore the midline of objective criminality in relation to these offences is of a higher order than for non-aggravated armed robbery. The amount of money stolen on each occasion was not great. In all the circumstances I would place the first three offences below the midline of objective criminality for aggravated armed robbery. The fourth offence is slightly more serious than the others, for reasons already given.
	
	
	Mr Phan pleaded guilty to all armed robbery charges, and is therefore entitled to a significant discount on sentence in relation to those offences. I will be discussing this shortly. In the meantime, I turn to say something about his background.
	


Mr Phan’s Background


	
	This information principally derives from the report of the forensic psychologist, Dr Peter Ashkar, dated 15 March 2016, which was tendered by the defence. Dr Ashkar had interviewed Mr Phan at the Long Bay Correctional Centre on 11 March 2016. He had previously been provided with relevant information relating to these offences and Mr Phan’s criminal record.
	
	
	Mr Phan is now aged 30, having been born on 14 November 1985. He is Vietnamese by birth, and migrated to Australia with his family when he was about five years old. His father was apparently a violent man who gambled and abused alcohol, and his parents separated when he was six or seven years old. Between the ages of nine and sixteen, he lived with a stepfather who was also violent, towards both himself and his mother. As a result he stayed away from home whenever possible. He described his mother as a vulnerable woman who did not speak English, and lived on a pension. He gets on well with her and with his three siblings. His schooling was difficult, as his English was limited. Also the family moved frequently and he attended different schools. In years 7 and 8 he gravitated towards an antisocial peer group and began to experiment with alcohol and illicit drugs. He left school after year 9 or 10 and he worked for some years in a number of different jobs, including being a receptionist in a brothel. Subsequently he began to use heroin and methamphetamine, and has not worked in paid employment since. The robbery offences were committed in order to obtain money to support his drug addiction. Mr Phan expressed considerable remorse for his offending behaviour, particularly the killing of Mr Yousaf. Dr Ashkar described him as starting to cry when describing the effect of Mr Yousaf’s death on his family.
	
	
	The doctor assessed Mr Phan as being of normal intelligence, although his verbal skills were weak, probably due to English being his second language. On clinical examination the doctor could find no evidence of serious personality pathology, and he doubted whether Mr Phan would satisfy the diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder. In general the doctor considered that, with appropriate intervention and support, the circumstances suggest a favourable prognosis in terms of Mr Phan’s eventual rehabilitation.
	
	
	Mr Phan has a criminal history going back to early 2002, when he was 16 years old, when he was placed on probation for two years in relation to several offences. Other than driving offences, he had no further brushes with the law until 2010. In 2010 and 2011 he came before Liverpool Local Court on four separate occasions for offences of shoplifting and larceny, for each of which a fine was imposed. In September 2013 – the month before the current offences were committed - he came before the Bankstown Local Court three times, in relation to charges of possessing a prohibited drug, larceny, and being in possession of stolen goods. Again a fine was imposed on each occasion.
	
	
	In summary, therefore, the offender has a fairly lengthy criminal history, although all for relatively minor offences, as indicated by the fact that he has never been in prison before. As Dr Ashkar observed, most if not all of these offences were committed in order to feed his drug dependency.
	


Accumulation of Sentences


	
	There are, in all, five offences for which Mr Phan is to be sentenced. A separate sentence needs to be specified in relation to each of those offences. For although there were similarities between the four armed robberies, they were unrelated in point of time and each involved different victims. Similarly, it goes without saying that a separate sentence needs to be imposed for the murder of Mr Yousaf, notwithstanding that it was closely connected with the Villawood Fruit Market robbery. This being the case, it is appropriate, in my opinion, to invoke the provisions of s.53A of the Act, and impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for all five offences. That section requires the Court to indicate the sentence it would have imposed in relation to each offence if separate sentences had been imposed (“the indicative sentences”), but it obviates the need to go through the complicated process of creating a cascading sentencing structure, in which each individual sentence is made partially concurrent with and partially cumulative upon other sentences, so as to achieve an overall sentence which is consistent with the principle of totality. Under s.53A that overall sentence will be imposed as the aggregate sentence. I should also indicate that in applying that provision I have taken into account the principles discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in JM v R [2014] NSWCCA 297.
	
	
	This takes me to a discussion of the sentences to be imposed in relation to each of the five offences, and to indicate the sentence which I would have imposed in the absence of s. 53A.
	


Indicative Sentences


	
	It goes without saying that the most serious offence is the murder of Mr Yousaf. The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Since the High Court judgment in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357, it has been accepted that the standard non-parole period constitutes a guide post rather than a starting point as had previously been considered.
	
	
	For this offence I would impose a sentence of imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. The reasons for setting a non-parole period which is well below the standard non-parole period for murder have essentially already been ventilated. Given the fact that this was a constructive murder situation, in which it was the co-offender who inflicted the fatal injuries, Mr Phan’s level of culpability for this offence is of a very low order indeed. In addition I would have found that special circumstances exist which justify a departure from the statutory proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period, namely the reasonably positive prospects of Mr Phan’s rehabilitation. I will be saying more about this later.
	
	
	The remaining four offences all consist of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon pursuant to s. 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum punishment for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period. Each of these offences must be considered separately, notwithstanding the similarities between them. There is, in any event, a difference between the reductions in sentence attributable to Mr Phan’s pleas of guilty.
	
	
	In relation to the robbery of the Subway Restaurant at Fairfield on 5 October 2013, but for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of approximately eight years. Mr Phan’s plea of guilty to this offence was entered on 8 May 2015, well before the matter was due to go to trial. Accordingly I would reduce his sentence by 20%, and impose a sentence of imprisonment for six years.
	
	
	Precisely the same considerations apply in relation to the robbery of the Food Works shop on 7 October 2013. The circumstances of the offence were strikingly similar to the earlier robbery, and a plea of guilty was also entered on 8 May 2015. Accordingly I would impose a sentence of six years imprisonment, after deducting 20% from a sentence of approximately eight years.
	
	
	The robbery of the Spring Gardens Chinese restaurant on 10 October 2013 raises slightly different considerations. Although the circumstances of the offence itself were similar to the other robbery offences, on this occasion Mr Phan’s plea of guilty was entered considerably later, on 6 October 2015 when the trial was due to commence. This was very shortly after the Crown had identified the cash trays found beneath Mr Phan’s bed as having been taken during this robbery. Accordingly I would reduce his eight year sentence by approximately 10%, and thus impose a sentence of imprisonment for seven years.
	
	
	Finally I come to the robbery of the Villawood Fruit Market on 12 October. This has the two additional aggravating factors I have already mentioned, namely the fact that Mr Phan was armed with a hammer, and that it occurred in the presence of a child under 18. But for the plea of guilty, I would have sentenced Mr Phan to imprisonment for approximately nine years for this offence. The guilty plea was entered early, on 8 May 2015, and accordingly I would reduce the sentence by approximately 20%, and impose a sentence of imprisonment of seven years.
	


The Aggregate Sentence


	
	At this point I turn to discuss the aggregate sentence to be imposed. This is designed to take into account the criminality involved in all five offences, according to the principle of totality. In determining this matter it is also appropriate to have regard to the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of the Act. To summarise the seven purposes set out in that provision, they are: to punish the offender and make him accountable for his actions, to protect the community, to deter the offender and others from committing similar offences, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to denounce the conduct of the offender and to recognise the harm done to victims and the community. Some of these point in different directions, and thus need to be balanced against each other. By way of example, the principles of deterrence generally point towards a harsher sentence, whereas the promotion of rehabilitation will normally lead to a reduction, at least in the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have already discussed the criminality involved in each of the five offences. They all took place within a relatively short time frame, between 5 and 12 October 2013. The robberies were all committed in order to feed Mr Phan’s drug addiction, and the murder would not have occurred in the absence of the fourth and last robbery.
	
	
	Mr Phan himself has had an extremely difficult life: coming to a new country, and then suffering from the emotional and physical abuse of both his father and his step-father. Certainly he has committed a number of offences in the past, but none of a very serious nature. He has been addicted to drugs since an early age, and it is most likely that his previous offences are all related, in one way or another, to his drug taking. His mother wrote a letter to the Court, which was admitted into evidence on sentence, in which she said that, since being imprisoned for these offences, he has stayed away from drugs. Upon his release she said that she will be happy for him to live with her, and she will do her best to help him stay away from drugs.
	
	
	All the circumstances point to the proposition that, if Mr Phan can refrain from reverting to substance abuse, he is unlikely to re-offend. This being the case, rehabilitation becomes a paramount consideration in his case. This in turn has a significant effect upon the appropriate non-parole period. In my view, the unusual demands of rehabilitation in his case constitute special circumstances which justify a departure from the statutory proportion between the overall sentence and the non-parole period.
	
	
	Mr Phan has been in custody since 12 October 2013 in relation to these offences, and his sentence will accordingly commence on that date.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I propose to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years.
	
	
	I am required to warn Mr Phan, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is about to be formally sentenced. At some future point of time, an application may be made that, notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody or else ought be the subject of an extended supervision order, impacting on his liberty.
	
	
	Mr Phan, I sentence you to an aggregate term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 14 years, commencing on 12 October 2013 and expiring on 11 October 2027, together with a balance of term of six years, commencing on 12 October 2027 and expiring on 11 October 2033.
	
	
	The first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 11 October 2027.

		21 April 2016",2016-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701726,RB v R [2016] NSWCCA 62,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Adamson J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: RB appeals against his conviction following a trial by jury before Payne DCJ at the District Court at Griffith. The sole ground of appeal is that:
	


“There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the Crown’s address effectively inviting the jury to reason, ‘why would they lie?’”


	
	The appellant was convicted of all five counts on the indictment: one count of commit act of indecency towards the complainant (his natural daughter) who was under 16 years of age and under his authority; three counts of sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then between the ages of 10 and 14 years in circumstances of aggravation (being under his authority); and one count of sexual intercourse with the complainant who was between the ages of 14 and 16 years in circumstances of aggravation (being under his authority).
	
	
	The indictment was presented on Monday 17 March 2014. The Crown case closed on 19 March 2014. The jury retired to consider its verdict on 20 March 2014 and returned verdicts of guilty on all five counts the following day, Friday 21 March 2014.
	


The Crown case at trial


	
	The Crown adduced evidence that when the appellant and his family were living in Leeton (in 2002 or 2003) he came into the complainant’s bedroom (when she was 10 or 11) and showed her a book which contained illustrations of adults in sexual positions. The complainant’s stepmother, KA, gave evidence that she kept the book in the bedroom which she shared with the appellant.
	
	
	In 2003 the appellant’s family moved to a farm at Merungle Hill where the conduct the subject of the five counts occurred. The conduct that constituted the first four counts occurred between August 2005 and September 2006 (when the complainant was 12 or 13). The conduct that constituted the fifth count occurred between September 2006 and September 2007 when the complainant was 14.
	


Count 1


	
	The appellant, who was wearing KA’s dressing gown which had white teddy bears on it, came to the complainant’s bedroom and exposed himself. He told her, “This is our little secret” and instructed her not to tell anyone.
	
	
	KA gave evidence that she had such a dressing gown and that the appellant would borrow it to wear from time to time.
	


Count 2


	
	The appellant entered the complainant’s bedroom late at night, touched her, undressed her and had penile vaginal intercourse with her.
	


Count 3


	
	The conduct referred to above with respect to count 2 was repeated sometime after the complainant’s first period finished.
	


Count 4


	
	On another occasion the appellant entered the complainant’s bedroom and made her suck his penis.
	


Count 5


	
	Between September 2006 and September 2007, the complainant (who was then 14) went for a drive with the appellant. During the trip he pulled to the side of the road and had penile vaginal intercourse with the complainant against the back of the car.
	


Incident in 2005


	
	When the complainant was in Year 7 (in 2005, when she was 12 or 13), she wrote a description of “what happened” on a piece of paper. She wrote that
	


“a father was sexually abusing me”

“how I didn’t like it and that if I didn’t get a boyfriend then my Dad would be my boyfriend and would always love me forever” . . . “because that’s what he had said to me”.


	
	KA discovered the piece of paper and confronted the complainant, in the appellant’s presence. The complainant responded: “it wasn’t about me, it was about a friend”. KA subsequently burnt the piece of paper. The complainant and KA gave evidence of KA’s discovery of the paper and what then ensued.
	


Disclosure of the offences on 4 September 2011 at a family barbecue


	
	On 4 September 2011 the appellant and KA hosted a family barbecue to celebrate Father’s Day at their home. The complainant, who was almost 19 and no longer living at the home, attended. Her younger brother, MB, was also there, as was a family friend, Matthew O’Loughlin.
	
	
	In the course of the barbecue, MB became upset and told KA that, some months before, he had seen the appellant having sex with a woman, Melissa. KA, who was distressed by the disclosure, asked the complainant whether she thought that MB was telling the truth. The complainant also became upset and answered, “Yes”. KA asked her why, to which she responded (referring to the incident in 2005 referred to above), “You know that journal that I told you about years ago, well I lied to you when I told you all that stuff in there was about a friend. It was all about me.”
	
	
	Mr O’Loughlin corroborated this evidence in part by saying that he was aware of there being some problem with MB in the course of the barbecue.
	
	
	According to KA, some time after the complainant had told her about the journal being about the appellant’s conduct towards her, KA called the appellant into a room. Others, including Mr O’Loughlin, followed her into the room. According to Mr O’Loughlin, MB nodded towards the appellant and said, “Why can’t he tell the truth for once?”
	
	
	According to KA, the following exchange ensued between KA and the appellant:
	


KA:   [MB] just told me when you took [him] out to the farm to teach him how to use the harvester you went to the flat and had sex with Melissa. . . [The complainant] said that you’d done it to her, what have you got to say about this?”

The appellant: Yes.


	
	Mr O’Loughlin, who had left the room, returned. KA told him that the appellant had had an affair. At some point, KA asked the complainant if it was all right for her to tell Mr O’Loughlin. The complainant agreed. KA then told Mr O’Loughlin that the appellant had sexually assaulted the complainant. The complainant said, “It’s true”. Mr O’Loughlin left the room and returned a short time later. He remembered that KA then said to the appellant, “Did you have an affair with the slut” and the appellant said “Yes”. KA then asked him if he sexually assaulted the complainant, to which he responded, “Yes, but I only done it once.”
	
	
	At this point, the other people left the room and KA grabbed the appellant. According to KA, the following exchange ensued.
	


KA: You’re nothing but a sick paedophile you rooted your own daughter.

The appellant: No, I am not, I only done it to her a couple of times.

KA: Only a couple of times, you’re fucking sick.


	
	KA then slapped the appellant and told him to “Get out”. He left.
	
	
	The complainant gave evidence that, two days after the barbecue, the appellant sent two text messages to her in which he said, “Sorry” and “Don’t blame yourself I will always love you”. She also gave evidence that in September or October 2011 the appellant sent her a message on Facebook in which he said, “I want you to look after [MB] and [KA] as best you can. I’m sorry that I have hurt you all. I hope that God will look after you and I might as well disappear.” The complainant immediately called the police and reported the Facebook message.
	


The police interview on 5 January 2012


	
	The Crown tendered the recorded interview with the appellant which took place on 5 January 2012. The conduct that comprised the five separate counts was put to the appellant, who denied each. Of present relevance, the appellant said in the interview:
	


“A182   …So it’s just a lot of allegations that were just, that’s all they are, allegations. After 14 years our relationship went sour and to cut a long story short I had an affair, and after that, probably about 2 months, maybe not quite 2 months after I had the actual affair she found out, and then that’s where all this just imploded.

…

A189   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I just, hopefully we can get to the bottom of it and get it sorted it out because like I said, it’s just somebody, she just --- because how, how do you say it a woman scorned.

…

Q244   It’s alleged that you told [the complainant] not to tell anyone.

A   No.

Q245   It’s alleged that you had sex with her until you ejaculated.

A   If all these alleged, allege alleges, well, if I’ve done they must have proof like DNA, my sperm samples, if I was such a bad person and all these, so many time surely they have, beside, yeah, it’s like I said, it’s just a woman scorned, and it’s out, out, out, they’re just, yeah, shockin’.”


	
	The appellant was later questioned about the barbeque on Father’s Day as follows:
	


“Q313   OK, that’s all right. Was there an incident that happened that day?

A   …that’s when all this, and well, not all this but when, this is when it come out that, yeah, that, when my partner found out that I’d had the affair, and yeah, just everything went haywire from there.

Q314   What did anyone make any other allegations to you apart from having an affair, was anything else said?

A   No, no, no. No, it was just it come out that I’d, I’d had an affair. The better half had asked me if, if it was true. I said, Yeah, straight up, you know, after 14 years it was true, I, you know, a couple of months ago I went and seen this sheila, Melissa, and, and the next thing I know sort of, yeah, she got there, and said she’s…up the street, beating the crap out of her.

…

Q324   …[MB] has disclosed to [KA] about that affair. [The complainant] has then disclosed about being sexually abuse by you… on Father’s Day about what’s happened. It’s then alleged that [KA] has confronted you with the allegations…and the affair, and it’s alleged that you’ve replied, Yes.

A   No, never, it never happened.”

The cross-examination of the Crown witnesses by the appellant’s counsel


	
	The appellant’s counsel at trial put to the complainant that none of the conduct that comprised the offences actually occurred. He did not put to the complainant that the appellant had not sent the text messages to her two days after the barbecue.
	
	
	It was put to KA in cross-examination that the appellant was not present when she spoke to the complainant about the handwritten note in 2005. It was also put to her that the appellant had made no admissions at the family barbecue on 4 September 2011. It was also put to Mr O’Loughlin that the appellant had not made any admissions at the barbecue.
	


Exchange before addresses about appropriate directions


	
	Prior to addresses, the following exchange between her Honour and counsel took place in the absence of the jury:
	


“HER HONOUR: Do you want the Jovanovic [R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520] direction?

WILSON [counsel for the appellant]: I haven’t put anything about that your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’m going to be raising the woman scorned thing but I don’t think it requires the direction.

WILSON: Motive to lie hasn’t been put to anyone.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No it hasn’t.

HER HONOUR: Crown no, defence no.”

The Crown address


	
	The Crown in its address said, of present relevance:
	


“Is she [the complainant] fabricating? Do you think she’s not a witness of truth, therefore she is lying? If you think that, have a look at the evidence she gives, she could simply say he had sexual assault with me four times in the bedroom, end of story, but she doesn’t say that. She says it starts with him showing the book, which is the Joys of Sex or whatever it was, one of those books, those educational books, she looks at that. She says that exposes himself to her. She doesn’t start the sexual assault, she says he exposed himself to me. I mean did she make that up? And then she has three – two counts of sexual intercourse and then fellatio. So what we will throw in a mix of different kinds of sexual assault? I mean it’s bizarre isn’t? And then we’ve got sex happening at a reserve or at a park in a car, at the back of car, the boot of a car. Is she making this up?

...

[KA] remembers, you saw [KA] this morning. Did you think she was not a witness of truth? Did you think she came along as the woman scorned? I will come to that in a minute.

…

Matthew O’Loughlin he knew this man for years. Is he going to come along and tell lies?

…

You see, and really you draw – you join the dots. It must mean, mustn’t it, it implode [sic, implied] that Matthew O’Loughlin, [the complainant] have come along to say yes this all happened – it didn’t really happen, but they’re falsely saying to you on oath and affirmation this happened because what, [KA] was upset. I mean it’s not actually put, it’s not put to anyone, but mustn’t you really draw the inference from what he says that that’s what he is saying. He doesn’t say that, I mean he’s talking about his own daughter, but he doesn’t say my own daughter is jumping on the bandwagon, he doesn’t say that, he says it’s a woman scorned, you know, it’s impossible, it could have happened, the walls are thin and all that sort of thing.

But, necessarily by saying that he involves Matthew O’Loughlin, what Matthew O’Loughlin, his friend, didn’t hear the admission and [the complainant] who comes along to talk about five charges of sexual abuse. Why because [KA] had – is upset because he had an affair with Melissa Sumner. Well it’s bizarre, absolutely bizarre, but that’s what he says.

…

The Crown says to you if you look at Matthew O’Loughlin, he has nothing to do with a woman scorned, he came along here, he knew this man for 14 years. You look at [the complainant], it’s her own father. She comes and gives evidence. And [KA], who remembers back.”

Further consideration of a Jovanovic direction after addresses and before the summing up


	
	After the appellant’s counsel addressed, and before the summing up, the following exchange occurred in the absence of the jury:
	


“HER HONOUR: No, all right. Now what did you finally settle about, that you’ve only – which [sic, Jovanovic] direction?

WILSON: We’re happy with that direction to be given, your Honour.

HER HONOUR: You want it now?

WILSON: Yes. The way my friend addressed I’ll be happy to have it, your Honour.”

The summing up


	
	In the course of the summing up, her Honour directed the jury as follows:
	


“Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as you have been told, the essential elements of the Crown case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt or the accused must be found not guilty; that is, in respect of the counts you are considering. If the case turns on the evidence of the complainant you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant has told the truth. As you have been told, it is your duty to decide whether you accept the evidence of a witness in whole or in part, and the complainant is no exception to that. It would be wrong to conclude that the complainant is telling the truth because there is no apparent reason in your view for her to lie. People lie for all sorts of reasons; sometimes it is apparent, sometimes it is not, sometimes the reason is discovered, sometimes it is not. You cannot be satisfied that the complainant is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for the complainant to have made up these allegations. There might be a reason for the complainant to be untruthful that nobody knows about.”


	
	Immediately after giving the Jovanovic direction, her Honour referred to the fact that the appellant had given a recorded interview. Her Honour said:
	


“Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the accused undertook an interview in this case. He was not obliged to speak to the police and that was what was clearly told to him, but he did speak to the police and was interviewed. What he says in the interview is a version given by the accused. It is not sworn evidence. It has therefore not been tested by way of cross-examination. The accused is not, though, required to prove anything, and the Crown, as part of its burden of discharging its obligation to prove the accused’s guilt, must satisfy you that it is a version of events that could not reasonably be true.”


	
	In summarising the Crown address, her Honour said:
	


“The Crown reminded you of the interview between the accused and the police. He reminded you that the accused had attributed these allegations to [KA] being upset over the affair with Melissa Sumner. He said if you accept this, it must necessarily mean that both [the complainant] and Matthew O’Loughlin have made up and fabricated their evidence because [KA] was upset over the affair.

And he also told you that you would think it unlikely that Matthew O’Loughlin, who had been a friend of the accused for many years, would come forward and lie on the basis that [KA] was angry with the accused.”

The ground of appeal


	
	The appellant contended that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the fact that the direction set out above addressed only the fact that the appellant did not have to establish motive to lie on behalf of the complainant. He submitted that the direction ought to have extended to the other witnesses relied on by the Crown, KA and Mr O’Loughlin, and ought to have specifically referred to the rhetorical questions asked by the Crown in final address.
	


Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules


	
	It was common ground that the appellant’s counsel at trial did not either seek a re-direction following the summing up, or that the jury be discharged. Accordingly, the appellant requires a grant of leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW)  which provides:
	


Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc

No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.


	
	This Court has repeatedly emphasised the duty of trial counsel to take objections or seek directions at trial: see for example, R v Roberts [2001] NSWCCA 163. The assumption that will generally be made is that a decision not to raise such matters has been taken for sound forensic reasons. In the present case, I consider such an assumption to be soundly based.
	
	
	First, the appellant was represented at trial by competent and experienced senior counsel. Secondly, there was nothing obvious to be gained, and much to be lost, by highlighting the motive of the principal Crown witnesses (the complainant, KA and Mr O’Loughlin) as an aspect of credibility.
	
	
	The question of motive was raised by the appellant in his record of interview. However, his trial counsel did not cross-examine the Crown witnesses on that basis. It can reasonably be assumed that this was a deliberate forensic choice. The points of view (or motives) of the three witnesses were different: the complainant was the appellant’s natural daughter; KA was the appellant’s wife, to whom he had been recently unfaithful; and Mr O’Loughlin was a long-standing friend of some 14 years. Therefore, even if KA’s evidence might be discounted on the basis (as the appellant would have it in the record of interview) that she was a “woman scorned”, this did not account for either the complainant’s evidence (although he also tried to put her in that category in the recorded interview) or the evidence of Mr O’Loughlin.
	
	
	It was put on behalf of the appellant in this Court that the appellant’s trial counsel had changed his mind about whether to require the Jovanovic direction (named after R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520) and that this change reflected an indecision which meant that it was not necessarily a considered view. I do not accept this submission. A trial is a not a fixed set piece; it is a dynamic event. The appellant’s trial counsel did not consider a Jovanovic direction to be required before the Crown address, but, following the Crown address, he said (after specifically referring to the Crown address) that he would be “happy to have one given”. This does not indicate any indecision, but rather a weighing up of the forensic effect of requiring such a direction as against any disadvantage of its being given, in light of the Crown address which rebutted the appellant’s suggestions as to the motives of the Crown witnesses to lie.
	
	
	Although there is much to be said, for the reasons given above, against a grant of leave under rule 4, I consider that, as the sole ground concerns the onus of proof, leave to rely on it ought be granted.
	


Consideration of the ground


	
	The reason expressed in the authorities for the concern about references to motive is that, in certain circumstances, such references are apt to reverse the onus of proof. Thus, in the case of Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1, an appeal against conviction was allowed, in part on the basis that the Crown had asked the appellant in cross-examination at his trial (for child sex offences) whether he could suggest any reason why the complainant would invent allegations against him.
	
	
	The plurality (Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ) in Palmer v The Queen  said, at [9] (footnotes omitted):
	


“If credibility which the jury would otherwise attribute to the complainant's account is strengthened by an accused's inability to furnish evidence of a motive for a complainant to lie, the standard of proof is to that extent diminished. That is the converse of the proposition stated by Cresswell J in the case cited by Wills where his Lordship acknowledged that proof of a motive to lie weakened a complainant's credibility. The correct view is that absence of proof of motive is entirely neutral.”


	
	However, this circumstance does not prevent the Crown from responding when an accused person advances motive as impugning the Crown’s witnesses. The various “principles” have been summarised in cases such as Doe v R [2008] NSWCCA 203 (per Latham J at [58]-[60]). However, ultimately the question is to be resolved by a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the particular trial and a determination made whether the jury has been correctly instructed as to the onus of proof, including that the accused bears no onus to prove a motive to lie.
	
	
	In the present case, the appellant sought to impugn KA’s credibility by casting her as a “woman scorned” in his record of interview. He applied the same description to the complainant herself when he said that she must have “sperm samples” if he was “such a bad person” and added “it’s, like I said, it’s just a woman scorned”. The Crown was also entitled to remind the jury that Mr O’Loughlin, who corroborated KA’s evidence of the admissions made by him at the barbecue, was a friend of the appellant’s and therefore (implicitly) could not be regarded as in league with the “woman scorned”.
	
	
	The so-called Jovanovic direction is set out in Sperling J’s judgment in R v Jovanovic at 542 where his Honour said:
	


Whilst it may not be necessary to give a particular direction in every caseinvolving complainant evidence, the following would, in my view, be a suitabledirection:

“It would be natural to ask yourselves why the complainant, X, wouldmake up such serious allegations against the accused. I give you thefollowing directions about that question:

1. As you have been told, the essential elements of the Crown case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt or the accused must be acquitted. If the case turns on the evidence of X, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that X has told the truth.

2. As you have been told, it is your duty to decide whether you acceptthe evidence of a witness in whole or in part. X is no exception to that.

3. It would be wrong to conclude that X is telling the truth because there is no apparent reason, in your view, for X to lie. People lie for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it is apparent. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes the reason is discovered. Sometimes it is not. You cannot be satisfied that X is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for X to have made up these allegations. There might be a reason for X to be untruthful that nobody knows about.”

I provide the foregoing draft direction, not because I am satisfied that such adirection is necessarily required in every case such as the present case, but in order to answer the suggestion that the approach in this judgment leads in some way to an unmanageable situation in the context of a criminal trial.


	
	The direction given by the trial judge which is set out in the narrative above is in terms of the draft direction in R v Jovanovic and concentrates on the complainant’s evidence. The reason for the concentration on the complainant’s evidence is clear: the complainant was the only person other than the appellant who was present when the acts constituting the five offences were said to have occurred. Therefore it was open to the jury to convict the appellant of all five counts as long as they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth.
	
	
	It was not necessary that the jury be satisfied that either KA or Mr O’Loughlin was telling the truth. The importance of KA’s evidence was that she relevantly:
	



	
	corroborated the complainant’s evidence about the presence of the book with illustrations of sexual positions in the house; the appellant’s use of her dressing gown, as described; and the appellant’s presence when the discussion about the complainant’s “journal” took place; and
	
	
	she gave evidence of admissions said to have been made by the appellant at the barbecue.
	



	
	The importance of Mr O’Loughlin’s evidence was that he corroborated KA’s evidence of the admissions made by the appellant at the barbecue and other interactions at the barbecue (including MB being upset before the confrontations occurred).
	
	
	Not only did her Honour give the Jovanovic direction as requested, but her Honour immediately thereafter also directed the jury’s attention to the fact of the recorded interview. Her Honour emphasised in the passage from the summing up set out above that the appellant was not “required to prove anything”.
	


Conclusion


	
	Having considered the way in which the Crown led the evidence from the complainant, KA and Mr O’Loughlin; the challenges to their evidence in cross-examination; the Crown address; and the summing up (which included not only a Jovanovic direction but a reiteration, in the context of the recorded interview, of the onus of proof), I do not consider that the jury would have been left with any impression that the applicant had to prove that any of these witnesses had a motive to lie. In my view, the trial judge, by her Honour’s careful directions set out above, amply and correctly directed the jury as to the onus of proof and the need for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the complainant’s evidence.
	
	
	The sole ground of appeal has not been made out. No miscarriage of justice, much less error, has been established.
	


Proposed orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Grant leave to the appellant to rely on the sole ground of appeal under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal.

2701738,R v NK [2016] NSWSC 498,"Judgment – ON APPLICATION FOR GRANT OF BAIL


	
	The applicant, NK, is presently aged 16 years. On 30 March 2016 she made application for a grant of bail pursuant to the Bail Act 2013.
	
	
	On 24 March 2016, the applicant was arrested and subsequently charged with an offence pursuant s 102.6(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), being an offence of collecting funds for, or on behalf of, a terrorist organisation. It is alleged that the offence was committed between 21‑22 March 2016.
	
	
	The applicant was charged in the following terms:
	


“That between 21 March 2016 and 22 March 2016 at XXX in the State of New South Wales, she did intentionally collect funds for a terrorist organisation, namely Islamic State, knowing that organisation was a terrorist organisation, contrary to s 102.6(1) of the Criminal Code.”


	
	The maximum penalty for an offence under that provision is a term of imprisonment of 25 years.
	
	
	On 24 March 2016, bail was refused at Parramatta Children’s Court. The present application for bail is opposed by the Crown.
	
	
	Section 15AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) provides:
	


“Despite any other law of the Commonwealth, a bail authority must not grant bail to a person … charged with … an offence covered by subsection (2) unless the bail authority is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail.”


	
	By s 3 of the Crimes Act 1914 a terrorism offence includes an offence against Parts 5.3 or 5.5 of the Criminal Code. The applicant is charged under s 102.6, which is found in Part 5.3 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly s 15AA(1) applies.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that exceptional circumstances do not exist to justify bail.
	
	
	In the event that the applicant is able to show exceptional circumstances, s 19 of the Bail Act 2013 provides that a bail authority must refuse bail if it is satisfied, on the basis of an assessment of bail concerns pursuant to s 17, that there is an acceptable risk as follows:
	


17 Assessment of bail concerns

(1)   A bail authority must, before making a bail decision, assess any bail concerns.

(2)   For the purposes of this Act, a bail concern is a concern that an accused person, if released from custody, will:

(a)   fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence, or

(b)   commit a serious offence, or

(c)   endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or

(d)   interfere with witnesses or evidence.

(3)   If the accused person is not in custody, the assessment is to be made as if the person were in custody and could be released as a result of the bail decision.

(4)   This section does not apply if the bail authority refuses bail under Division 1A (Show cause requirement).

…

19 Refusal of bail—unacceptable risk

(1)   A bail authority must refuse bail if the bail authority is satisfied, on the basis of an assessment of bail concerns under this Division, that there is an unacceptable risk.

(2)   For the purposes of this Act, an unacceptable risk is an unacceptable risk that the accused person, if released from custody, will:

(a)   fail to appear at any proceedings for the offence, or

(b)   commit a serious offence, or

(c)   endanger the safety of victims, individuals or the community, or

(d)   interfere with witnesses or evidence.

(3)   If the offence is a show cause offence, the fact that the accused person has shown cause that his or her detention is not justified is not relevant to the determination of whether or not there is an unacceptable risk.

(4)   Bail cannot be refused for an offence for which there is a right to release under Division 2A.

Evidence on the Application


	
	In support of the application was the report from Mr Sam Borenstein, Clinical Psychologist, dated 11 April 2016 addressed to the applicant’s solicitors, a copy of which was tendered as part of Exhibit 1.
	
	
	The applicant also relied upon the following:
	



	
	An affidavit sworn 11 April 2016 by the applicant’s maternal aunt. In the affidavit her aunt states that if bail was granted the plaintiff could live at her home and she would undertake supervision of the applicant.
	
	
	An affidavit sworn 11 April 2016 by another aunt of the applicant. In the affidavit her aunt has stated that she is willing to act as surety for the applicant. She is the registered proprietor of certain real estate which she states is valued at $900,000 and which is subject to a mortgage of $353,000. She stated in her affidavit that she would use the equity of $500,000 in a form of security over her property for the purpose of being a surety for the applicant.
	
	
	An affidavit affirmed 13 April 2016 as to electronic monitoring technology.
	



	
	The Crown tendered the following documents;
	



	
	Crown bail chronology with attached written submissions (Exhibit A).
	
	
	A Statement of Facts dated 13 April 2016 (Exhibit B).
	
	
	An annexure: Glossary of Common Arabic Terms / Words (Exhibit C).
	


Applicant’s Submissions


	
	In submissions for the applicant it was noted that she is a 16 year old girl who is in custody for the first time in her life. She does not have any prior convictions.
	
	
	The proceedings in respect of the charge brought against her are next listed for Reply on 19 May 2016 at Parramatta Children’s Court. No brief material has been served to date.
	
	
	It was noted that a co-accused, an adult male, is the subject of proceedings brought against him and they are before the Central Local Court. It is anticipated that in the future there may be a joint trial. This, it was submitted, would result in delay before a trial date can be allocated.
	
	
	On behalf of the applicant it was additionally submitted:
	



	
	The age of the applicant is a significant consideration and may be taken into account in combination with other factors.
	
	
	The applicant has not been charged with any previous offences.
	
	
	The applicant has been assessed by Mr Borenstein as suffering from a chronic Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood.
	
	
	An extended period of incarceration of between 18 months to 2 years whilst the applicant awaits the finalisation of the proceedings would, in Mr Borenstein’s opinion, impact significantly on her psychological health, possibly leading to a major depressive episode impacting on her ability to instruct legal counsel.
	
	
	The applicant was born in New South Wales and has lived in this State all her life. She is an Australian citizen. She has always resided with her family which includes her mother and her sister.
	
	
	The applicant has a significant number of family members in the community.
	
	
	One of the applicant’s aunts is willing to provide surety in the amount of $500,000. This, it was submitted, would provide the Court with confidence that the applicant would comply with any bail conditions.
	
	
	The applicant is willing to be subjected to strict conditions including the imposition of electronic monitoring bracelet in the form of an ankle bracelet.
	
	
	It was submitted that there are no unacceptable risks and that bail conditions can mitigate any risks as raised by the Crown.
	
	
	The imposition of substantial surety would address any concern as to the risk of the applicant absconding.
	
	
	The applicant does not possess a passport and she would comply with any condition that she is not to apply for any travel documents.
	
	
	The applicant is prepared to be the subject of a condition that confines her to what was referred to as ‘house arrest’. The applicant would be residing with her aunt who would provide full-time supervision.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant has strong family ties in the community is a disincentive for any motivation of absconding.
	
	
	The fact that the applicant has an unblemished history with no convictions is a matter that would mitigate any bail concerns.
	



	
	In all the circumstances of the case, it was submitted that the relevant factors, when combined, establish exceptional circumstances permitting the court to grant bail on strict conditions.
	


Crown Submissions


	
	It was submitted for the Crown that it is well accepted that there is a heavy onus on the applicant to show that exceptional circumstances exist. In that respect it was incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate something unusual or out of the ordinary, or ‘special’ when compared to circumstances that affect all accused in a similar position to the applicant.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence in the Crown case would establish proof of the allegations made in respect of an offence as charged under s 102.6 of the Criminal Code. Reference was made, in summary form, to evidence that the Crown will rely upon at trial.
	
	
	It was submitted that on a bail application it is not incumbent upon the Crown to adduce evidence that would be admissible at trial: s 31(1) Bail Act.
	
	
	Further, for the test under s 15AA to be satisfied, the prosecution case, taken at its highest, must be shown to be exceptionally weak. It was submitted that the prosecution in this case could not be described as weak.
	
	
	The conditions of custody, including in particular restrictions on visitation, communication and other aspects, do not amount to or constitute exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	Taking all matters into account, the Crown submitted that there are no exceptional circumstances in the present case to satisfy the threshold requirement for a consideration of her release.
	
	
	In the event that the court was satisfied that exceptional circumstances existed, then the Crown relied on submissions in relation to bail concerns under s 18 of the Bail Act. These were addressed at [37]-[51] of the Crown’s Written Submissions.
	
	
	It was submitted that the risk of reoffending cannot be mitigated in the event of bail being granted.
	


Principles


	
	The following principles may be derived from the relevant caselaw:
	



	
	Section 15AA of the Crimes Act 1914 has been said to enact a rebuttable presumption against bail being granted to a person charged with a terrorism offence: Hammoud v DPP [2006] VSC 516 per Bongiorno J at [1].
	
	
	Section 15AA of the Crimes Act 1914 prevents the court from granting bail unless it is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail. While such a provision requires the applicant to satisfy the court, it does not prohibit bail in all cases. I has been observed that each application for bail, even under these provisions:
	


“…must be so dealt with in a way that does more than pay mere lip service to the anxious concern of the law that circumstances do alter cases and that it is rarely, if ever, that a simple, not to say a simplistic one size fits all approach, will be the best way of achieving a just individual result”: Regina v Mirsad Mulahalilovic 2006/763, 1 August 2006, per Rothman J quoting dicta in R v Newbury, Sully J, NSWSC, 27 January 2006, unreported)


	
	In Hammoud v DPP, supra, it was observed that as the “presumption” referred to in (1) above is rebutted only if exceptional circumstances exist to justify bail, the onus is upon an applicant to satisfy the Court affirmatively that such circumstances exist: at [2].
	
	
	Section 15AA sets an extremely high hurdle. The requirement for exceptional circumstances imposes a high test.
	
	
	The word “exceptional” has received judicial attention in many cases. What must be shown is that there is some situation which is out of the ordinary in some respect which the detainee can point to as justifying the adjective “exceptional”: Hammoud v DPP at [3].
	
	
	The concept of exceptional circumstances is necessarily a flexible one. Such circumstances may be constituted by a combination of matters which taken together may render the case exceptional: Haddara v Commonwealth DPP [2006] VSC 8 at [5] per Osborn J and R v Young [2006] NSWSC 1499 at [19] and [20] per Johnson J (as to s 9C of the Bail Act 1978).
	
	
	Exceptional circumstances is a threshold issue that requires a case-by-case examination and that there is no definitive definition that would apply to all cases: R v Maywand Osman 2015/12786, 12 February 2015 at p 6 per Hall J.
	
	
	In considering the issue of exceptional circumstances, not only can a combination of matters constitute such features but they can include features that are subjective to the particular applicant, features which bear upon the nature of the alleged offence and features which emphasise, absent the particular test, that the applicant is otherwise a person who will answer bail: R v Mulvihill [2013] NSWSC 1190 at [10] and [11] per Price J.
	


The Provisions of Section 15AA


	
	The offence charged under s 102.6.(1) of the Criminal Code is an indictable offence and is not an offence for which there is a right to release under s 21 of the Bail Act.
	
	
	In relation to the provisions of s 15AA, the following matters may be noted:
	



	
	Section 15AA(1) imposes a statutory prohibition on a bail authority granting bail to a person charged with an offence covered by s 15AA(2).
	
	
	However, the section also provides for a statutory exception to that prohibition where the bail authority:
	



	
	“is satisfied”
	
	
	that “exceptional circumstances” exist;
	
	
	being circumstances that “justify” a grant of bail.
	



	
	The phrase “is satisfied” denotes a decision of an evaluative kind.
	
	
	The phrase “exceptional circumstances” may be taken as referring to circumstances that are, unusual, out of the ordinary, or special: Oxford English Dictionary.
	



	
	The word “justify” in s 15AA(1) is to be given its ordinary meaning, but subject to the other provisions of s 15AA(1). Whilst the Oxford English Dictionary meaning of “justify” includes “make right, proper or reasonable”, “give adequate grounds for”, “warrant”, in the context of s 15AA(1), I consider that to justify a grant of bail, the circumstances must be such as to warrant a grant of bail.
	
	
	What circumstances may amount to “exceptional circumstances” cannot be determined by reference to any fixed category of class of case. The facts and circumstances of each case will guide the determination as to whether they evidence or are capable of constituting exceptional circumstances.
	
	
	As noted above, the phrase “exceptional circumstances” admits to a degree of flexibility. The circumstances may include the personal or subjective circumstances of an applicant for bail. They may also include circumstances relating to a strength or weakness of a Crown case.
	


Relevance of Youth

(a) The Applicant


	
	As the applicant is underage (under the age of 18 years), the proceedings in respect of the charge pursuant to s 102.6(1) have been brought in the Children’s Court.
	
	
	Prior to her arrest she was enrolled in a Sydney high school. According to the history recorded by Mr Borenstein she had taken days off school around April 2015 and thereafter began to lose interest in school and mixed with “older persons”.
	


(b) Section 15AA – the Relevance of Youth


	
	On the hearing of the present application Mr I Abdul-Karim (Principal Federal Prosecutor, Commonwealth Office of Director of Public Prosecutions), who appeared on behalf of the respondent, the Crown, submitted that s 15AA “does not make a distinction between an adult and a child and what is important about the opening sentence in s 15AA [is that it] commences with the words ‘Despite any other law of the Commonwealth …’: 18 April 2016 at T 16:15-20. Reference was made to s 20C of the Crimes Act 1914 which picks up State provisions relating to children which it was submitted would include provisions in the Bail Act. Section 15AA it was noted, overrode those factors when a court is considering the test of exceptional circumstances: T 16:20-25. Mr Abdul-Karim when asked whether the age of the applicant was to be ignored responded that I would not ignore it but that “it is simply one factor within many”: T 16. I accept and act upon the basis that it is a relevant circumstance. It is one to which a court must give consideration.
	
	
	The law, both statutory and caselaw, has long acknowledged and taken into account the youth of a person charged with, or convicted of, a criminal offence. The underlying rationale for doing so is well-accepted. In that respect, in sentencing law it has been observed that the law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law and that allowance will be made for an offender’s youth and not just their biological age: KT v R (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [22] per McClellan CJ at CL. The weight to be given to a person’s youth, it has been observed, diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity: R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45].
	


(c) The Circumstances Bearing Upon the Alleged Involvement of the Applicant in the Offence Charged


	
	On the hearing of the application, the Crown relied upon the Statement of Facts dated 13 April 2016 (Exhibit B). Reference was made to parts of the document insofar as they were said to relate to certain alleged facts pertaining to the applicant and to the claimed strength of the Crown case. Exhibit B, however, also contains material that, on a prima facie basis, reveals the influence of others (in particular, two adult males) upon the alleged involvement of the applicant. To the extent that such material does so, and consistent with principles established by the relevant caselaw, in particular, points (5) and (7) in para [26], it may be taken into account in the determination of whether exceptional circumstances within s 15AA(1) do exist.
	
	
	In Hammoud v DPP, supra, Bongiorno J observed:
	


“… About the only circumstance which is not yet, but which may become exceptional, is that created by the relatively low level of the applicant’s involvement in these alleged crimes and the low level of the crimes themselves in the panoply of terrorist offences …”: at [8]


	
	The material in Exhibit B refers to the alleged activities of two adult males to whom I shall refer to as MA and AM. MA was aged 20 years of age. AM was 24 years. Exhibit B indicates that there were a number of conversations amongst them between January and March 2016. In one conversation AM requests MA to go and see the applicant and puts to MA that he is going to “pick her up to go to dinner”: p 5. There are references in particular conversations between MA and AM to the applicant as “the girl” or “the younger girl”: p 9. There is material in the conversations between the two males that is capable of demonstrating on the particular occasion in question AM spoke to the applicant informing and instructing her as to “the best way” or the “method’ to be employed: p 15.
	
	
	Whatever may have been the applicant’s understanding or willingness to engage in any activity (and I make no finding or suggestion that she did engage in any activity), there is material within Exhibit B which, in my assessment, prima facie, is capable of supporting an inference that the two adult males, MA and AM, were seeking to engage, utilise or influence an underage person (the applicant) in giving effect to whatever the enterprise or objective they had in mind.
	
	
	The issue of a juvenile’s youth, as I have earlier stated, is a relevant factor in determining the issue of exceptional circumstances. It is also evidence, in my opinion, that is relevant to actions or dealings between adults intent on engaging a juvenile in the implementation of a plan that may be associated with any alleged involvement by the juvenile.
	
	
	The observations to which I have referred in paragraph [39] are not, of course, in any way intended or are to be taken as expressing any view or conclusion upon any issue as to possible criminal liability or responsibility of the applicant. They are intended to provide no more than an illustration that, depending upon the evidence, in some cases the possible vulnerability of youth to adult persuasion or influence may be a relevant consideration in a determination as to whether exceptional circumstances under s 15AA exist.
	
	
	Certain provisions of the Bail Act reflect a legislative concern that, in relation to matters concerning the grant of bail, the position of a juvenile attracts the need for specific provisions. Thus, for example, s 16A of the Bail Act, imposes an onus upon a person seeking bail in relation to a “show cause” offence as to why his or her detention is not justified. However, s 16A(3) provides:
	


“This section does not apply if the accused was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offence.”


	
	Section 18 of the Bail Act requires a bail authority to consider particular matters in an assessment of bail concerns under Part 3, Division 2 of that Act. Subparagraph (k) of s 18(1) provides:
	


“Any special vulnerability or needs the accused person has including because of youth, being an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, or having a cognitive or mental health impairment.” (emphasis added)


	
	I acknowledge, as earlier indicated, as the Crown submitted, that the provisions of s 15AA(1) operate notwithstanding particular provisions contained within State legislation, including the Bail Act. However, the point remains that in assessing “exceptional circumstances” under those provisions, the youth of an alleged offender is potentially an important consideration in the application of s 15AA.
	


(d) The Psychological Assessment


	
	As noted above, the applicant has been assessed by Mr Borenstein in his capacity as Clinical Psychologist, he having seen the applicant on 11 April 2016. In the history provided to him by the applicant, she had developed, during 2015, symptoms consistent with depressed mood and anxiety with significant weight gain: p 4. The history included an account of her separating from peers and loss of confidence.
	
	
	There is, of course, a need for caution in cases where examining psychologists act upon self-reporting and there is no direct evidence in relation to the applicant’s condition prior to March 2016: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353.
	
	
	That said, I note however that the test administered by Mr Borenstein, the Personality Assessment Screener, which measures for potential problem areas of mental health, produced an elevated result on the social withdrawal element which Mr Borenstein stated reflects a degree of social detachment and some discomfort in close relationships consistent with the applicant’s description of a fallout with peers over the previous 12 to 18 months and a sense of isolation.
	
	
	On one view, the assessment of Mr Borenstein of the applicant’s condition in the year prior to March 2016, can be taken as evidence of a particular or additional vulnerability beyond the vulnerability which may be associated with a female person aged 16 years.
	
	
	The observations made by Mr Borenstein, including the opinion he has expressed as to the deleterious effects of detention upon the applicant, in my assessment, provides an additional element or factor supportive of a finding, which I make, of exceptional circumstances under s 15AA(1). However, even in the absence of such evidence, for the reasons earlier discussed, I consider that the vulnerability arising from the youth of the applicant did exist in this case and independently provides the basis for the finding I have made as to the existence of exceptional circumstances. Such a finding, in my opinion, is not precluded, upon the facts of this case, by the matters raised in support of the submission as to the strength of the Crown case.
	
	
	I have considered the other matters advanced in support of the application made (including the question of delay and time in custody). However, upon consideration, I do not consider that such matters are such as to (beyond what I have earlier stated as to Mr Borenstein’s evidence) assist in the determination of circumstances under s 15AA(1).
	


The Unacceptable Risk Test


	
	On the basis of the finding I have made, the applicant’s application is to be assessed having regard to the relevant provisions of the Bail Act, in particular, the provisions of s 17 (extracted in para [9] above) concerning the assessment of “bail concerns” and the matters to be considered as part of that assessment under s 18 of the Act.
	
	
	The Crown in relation to matters arising under s 18, observed:
	


Section 18(1)(a)

That the applicant is a school student aged 16 years (Year 12) and lives with her mother and siblings.

Section 18(1)(b) – Nature and seriousness of the offence

The offence charged is serious with a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 25 years. In relation to her “alleged involvement”, reliance was placed upon the Statement of Facts (Exhibit B).

Section 18(1)(c) – Strength of the prosecution case

The Crown submission was that the Crown case was a strong one.

Section 18(1)(g) – Whether the accused person has any criminal associations

There was no affirmative submission made as to any evidence of criminal associations following the applicant’s arrest.

Section 18(1)(h) – Length of time likely to spend in custody if bail is refused

The Crown stated it was conscious of the importance of progressing the proceedings as quickly as possible and that all reasonable steps would be taken to ensure that that occurs.

Section (1)(i) – Likelihood of a custodial sentence if convicted of the offence 

The submission was that, if convicted, the applicant would face a lengthy custodial sentence.

Section 18(1)(j)

Was not applicable.

Section 18(1)(k) – Any special vulnerability or needs of the accused person has including because of youth

Again reference was properly made to the applicant’s age.


	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the risk to the community could not be mitigated if bail was granted: at [50].
	
	
	I have considered, in accordance with the provisions of s 18(1)(p) whether bail conditions can reasonably be imposed so as to address any bail concerns in accordance with s 20A. Having regard to the provisions of the lastmentioned section I consider that conditions can be imposed which satisfy the matters set out in s 20A(2) and meet any “unacceptable risk”.
	
	
	I have considered proposed bail conditions as set out in paragraph 13.11 of the applicant’s written submissions. Subject to one matter, I consider that the conditions therein proposed to be appropriate conditions. As I have indicated to the parties, however, I propose to provide the opportunity for any further submissions to be made in relation to conditions to bail. Subject thereto I propose, when the matter is relisted today, to grant bail to the applicant on strict conditions.

		22 April 2016",2016-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701746,Wiseman v R [2016] NSWCCA 61,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offence and sentence

The applicant pleaded guilty to one offence of supply a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years. The commission of this offence breached two 12 month Local Court s 9 bonds imposed for shop lifting and custody of a knife. These bonds were called up and dealt with in the District Court with the supply offence.


	
	The matter proceeded before Toner SC DCJ on 13, 22, 23 and 29 April 2015. On 29 April 2015 his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months, backdated to commence on 28 February 2015 with a balance of term of 6 months. The s 9 bonds were dealt with by way of a conviction and no further penalty pursuant to s10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Act).
	
	
	The applicant was in custody, serving sentences imposed by the Local Court for a number of other offences from 29 May 2014 until 9 April 2015. The effect of his Honour backdating the commencement date of the sentence for this offence to 28 February 2015 meant that the effective non-parole period when one combined all of the sentences was 2 years and 3 months with a total term of 2 years and 9 months.
	
	
	The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal.
	


Ground 1 – The sentencing judge failed properly to consider the issue of special circumstances in the context of partially accumulating the sentence upon those sentences being served.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	On 29 May 2014 police were advised that a man was passed out in a parked vehicle in the car-park at Nobby’s Beach, Port Macquarie. Police attended and located the applicant at about 6.15am slumped behind the wheel of the car in the driver's seat with the headlights on and the engine running. The applicant did not respond to police tapping on a window so they opened the driver's door and were able to rouse him. There was a glass pipe on the passenger seat. The applicant appeared drug affected and admitted that he had been consuming illicit drugs. The police told the applicant that they intended to search both him and his car.
	
	
	As he was being searched, the applicant removed an item from his pocket and placed it in his mouth. Police tried to remove the item from the applicant's mouth causing him to violently resist. The applicant refused to spit the object out and tried to swallow it. He was handcuffed, and an ambulance was called.
	
	
	The applicant continued to refuse to remove the item from his mouth, and was taken to hospital where a doctor eventually removed it. The item was examined by police and found to be an oval container with two plastic bags both containing white granules. The substance was examined and found to be 14.54 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 79.5%.
	
	
	The applicant was discharged from hospital and taken to the police station and entered into custody. The applicant made admissions during an electronically recorded interview regarding possession of the drug. He told police that he had purchased the drug in the Newcastle area for $4000.
	


Proceedings in District Court


	
	The primary judge found that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was entitled to a 25% discount on sentence.
	
	
	In relation to objective seriousness, the primary judge noted the quantity of drugs involved and their purity. His Honour found that while those matters were not determinative, they were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offending. In that regard his Honour noted that the indictable quantity of that drug is 5 grams and the trafficable quantity is 3 grams so that this was a deemed supply offence. His Honour took into account as a matter of aggravation that the applicant was subject to two s 9 bonds at the time of the offence.
	
	
	In relation to subjective matters his Honour took into account that the applicant had a very extensive criminal history. His Honour said:
	


“Clearly this man has been using drugs all of his adult life. He has been given every opportunity to do something about it and none of it has been effective.

I have the advantage of a pre-sentence report which describes just that, and a report from Dr First which really confirms that he is a drug addict. Dr First makes diagnoses of substance use disorder, methylamphetamine dependence and opioid dependence and a drug-induced psychotic mood disorder which in layman’s terms simply translates into drug addict.

There are no special circumstances in this man’s case. He was in a long term relationship and perhaps what generated his collapse on this occasion was the fact that [the] relationship was falling to pieces, but had fallen to pieces because he had taken up with a younger woman and apparently that had fallen to pieces on him as well.

This man’s criminality is of his own doing. Time is up. He is now 37. He should be of an age where he knows better. Unless he does something about his drug use you would not be much longer for this world.” (Sentence judgment 2.7 – 3.3)


	
	His Honour set out the sentence which he proposed to impose. The only outstanding matter was the commencement date for the sentence. In that regard, his Honour noted that there were other matters which had been dealt with in the Local Court which did not appear on his criminal history. The circumstances in which those sentences were imposed and the commencement date for those sentences were not clear. His Honour adjourned the matter so that he could be provided with information about those sentences. With the benefit of that information and after further submissions, his Honour backdated the commencement date for the sentence to 28 February 2015. His Honour’s reasons were given ex tempore.
	


Applicant’s submissions


	
	The applicant submitted that s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act did not permit the parole period to exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless special circumstances were found. In the sentence proceedings, he sought a finding of special circumstances based on his drug addiction and need for rehabilitation but this submission had been rejected. In that regard, the applicant accepted that while it was open to the primary judge to find special circumstances, he did not err in refusing to do so.
	
	
	The thrust of the applicant’s complaint was not his Honour’s refusal to find special circumstances but that his Honour’s remarks on sentence had no regard to the effect of accumulation upon the overall ratio of the effective non-parole period of his sentence to the total term of imprisonment which he was required to serve.
	
	
	On that issue the applicant noted that as a result of the sentences imposed on him in the Local Court, he went into custody on 29 May 2014 and was not due to be released until 9 April 2015 at the earliest. He submitted that when one added to those sentences, the sentence which the primary judge imposed for the supply offence, the total non-parole period would be 2 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 6 months, i.e. the ratio of the non-parole period to the overall sentence would be 81.5%. While accepting that s 44(2) allows for the balance of term to be less than one-third of the non-parole period, the applicant submitted that the failure of the primary judge to address the impact of the partial accumulation upon the affected non-parole period suggested that the impact was overlooked.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the judgment of Hidden J (with whom Whealy JA and Johnson J agreed) in Luke Nathan Richard Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213. There Hidden J held that because an offender was already serving sentences for other matters, the effect of accumulation of a further sentence needed to be taken into account:
	


“29   It is well established that accumulation of sentence, whether by reference to sentences passed on one occasion or to a sentence which the offender is already serving, is a basis for a finding of special circumstances. Equally, it is well established that whether special circumstances are found for that reason is a matter for judgment in each case. Certainly, there is not a general requirement that the proportion between effective non-parole period and aggregate sentence should not exceed 75%. Nevertheless, where it does, one would expect the sentencing judge to articulate his or her reasons for doing so and, in the absence of such reasons, the inference might be drawn that the practical effect of the accumulation was overlooked: R v Nightingale [2005] NSWCCA 147, per Tobias JA (with whom Buddin and Hall JJ agreed) at [39] - [46].”


	
	The applicant submitted that the absence of express reasons by the primary judge for imposing an effective non-parole period significantly in excess of the statutory ratio was indicative of error. The applicant submitted that the error could be corrected by varying the existing non-parole period to 1 year and 3 months. Alternatively, the applicant submitted that because error in the sentencing process had occurred, the Court could proceed to re-sentence on the basis that a lesser sentence was warranted in law pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	


Consideration


	
	The other sentences imposed by the Local Court commencing 29 May 2014 and expiring 9 April 2015 related to four larceny offences, two goods in custody offences, four offences of possessing a prohibited drug and one offence of being in possession of suspected proceeds of crime. Some of those sentences were fully or substantially concurrent. The sentence in this matter was partially accumulated on those sentences. The applicant’s submissions overlook the extensive and repeated discussions between the primary judge and the applicant’s legal representative during the sentencing proceedings on 22 and 29 April 2015 regarding an appropriate starting date for sentence for the supply offence in the light of these previous terms of imprisonment. The principle of totality in the context of the accumulation of sentences was also discussed. His Honour was clearly aware of the fact of the partial accumulation and its effect on the existing sentences. It cannot be said that this was overlooked by his Honour.
	
	
	One of the issues before his Honour was whether the sentence which he was going to impose for the supply offence should be fully or partially accumulated. On that issue, his Honour rejected the submission by the Crown by making the sentence for this matter partially accumulated.
	
	
	When giving effect to totality, due to the partial accumulation of sentences, the primary judge was not obliged to reduce the current sentence so that it resulted in an effective non-parole period of 75% of the total head sentence. Section 44(2) of the Act does not require such an adjustment. It is also clear that his Honour was mindful of the overall effect of the sentence that he imposed, given that the proceedings were adjourned in order for the Crown to obtain an up to date criminal record showing the dates of the previous sentences. There were lengthy interchanges with the applicant’s legal representative and his Honour on this issue.
	
	
	Finally, the sentencing judge was obliged to impose a sentence which appropriately reflected the overall criminality of the offending. To have increased the level of concurrency would not have achieved this purpose. The sentence which his Honour imposed had to observe the principle of totality. His Honour was fully aware of this which is why he made this sentence partially concurrent with the earlier sentences. In the circumstances of this case it would have been open to his Honour to wholly accumulate the sentence on the last of the parole periods. His Honour declined to do so in accordance with the submissions of the applicant’s legal representative. His decision to impose the sentence which he did was a fully considered one.
	
	
	No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion. Accordingly, the order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	HARRISON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		26 April 2016",2016-04-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701751,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 47) [2016] NSWSC 470,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	Counsel for the accused McNamara has foreshadowed an intention to lead evidence of parts of the content of a letter bearing a date 26 June 2015, said to have been received by McNamara whilst in custody.
	
	
	To the extent that it is relevant for present purposes, the note, which is signed ""Reesy"", is in the following terms:
	


“I got your min of (sic) Roger so I could write to say hello, I thought it mite (sic) lift your spirits up bit as well.

Roger is missing you as well I think, I hope yous (sic) do well at court. It was good to meet you your (sic) a good bloke. You don't get many of them in jail.

Well mate it was good talk to ya. I hope everything werks (sic) out for ya.

Take care, Reesy.”


	
	The document is said to have been delivered to the accused in an envelope addressed to, ""Glen McMarrara (sic) Silver-Water-Jail, min 541876"". The rear of the envelope is endorsed ""Jason Rees, 207972 Silver-Water-Jail"".
	
	
	Mr Wendler has indicated he does not intend to tender the document. However he seeks to elicit evidence of that part of its contents as outlined above.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submitted that the evidence is relevant in general terms, to the issue of duress raised by McNamara. He submitted that the only real issue was whether or not it ought be excluded under s. 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”). He submitted, in circumstances where there will be evidence identifying the type of envelope as one which is issued to persons in custody, that such a fact, along with the contents of the note, sustain an inference that the person who wrote it did so at the behest of Rogerson.
	
	
	Evidence will also be sought to be led from McNamara as to his perception of what was written. I infer that if asked, McNamara will say that he perceived the content of the note to be a further threat.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Mr Thomas objected to the admission of the evidence. Both submitted, in effect, that it ought be excluded on the basis that there was a danger of unfair prejudice which would flow to Rogerson, such unfair prejudice substantially outweighing any probative value the evidence might have.
	
	
	Mr Thomas also raised the applicability of s. 87 of the Act although in light of the conclusion I have reached I do not need to consider the terms of that section.
	
	
	I have some misgivings about whether the evidence could be said to be any way relevant. There is certainly no direct evidence that the letter was written by Mr Rees at the behest of Rogerson. It is that which would render the evidence relevant. Even assuming that hurdle were overcome (and I doubt that it is) it is my view that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial Rogerson if it were admitted. In particular, the document is capable of more than one interpretation. Accordingly, I propose to reject the evidence.

2701757,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 44) [2016] NSWSC 451,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	On 1 April 2016 the Crown called Joanne Sofrenic, an intelligence analyst, through whom evidence was tendered of telecommunications contact between each of the accused, and between the individual accused and other persons. In the course of Ms Sofrenic being cross-examined (commencing at T2824 L14) Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, asked her questions about certain data which had been obtained and been provided to her, which was referred to as “GPRS data”.
	
	
	Ms Sofrenic explained that she had a ""very basic knowledge"" of GPRS data. She said (at T2824 L24) that she understood GPRS to stand for ""General Packet Radio Service"", which referred to (inter alia) internet usage. However, she repeated that she did not have a full knowledge of it.
	
	
	Ms Sofrenic also stated (at T2824 L31 and following) that she understood that GPRS data was not referable to “deliberate use” of the internet, but that it could refer to “automatic access” to the internet through a phone service. She also expressed some understanding (the basis of which was not entirely clear) that email communications could manifest themselves as GPRS data.
	
	
	In the course of the proceedings today Mr Thomas cross-examined Det. Phillips, the officer-in-charge of the investigtion, and showed him a document which he described as ""an extract of telecommunications involving Jamie Gao and Glen McNamara that involved the use of the internet, that is GPRS, for the period 1 April 2014 through to 23 May 2014"". Det. Phillips replied that the document indicated internet activity on the individual phones of the deceased and McNamara at that period of time.
	
	
	Det. Phillips was then asked questions relating to what has been referred to as a “Viber” application installed on the phone of McNamara. He explained that this was a specific application that permitted use of the internet to transmit voice and other messages. The connection (if any) between GPRS data and “Viber” has not been otherwise explained.
	
	
	Mr Thomas then sought to tender the document shown to Det. Phillips. It was objected to by Mr Wendler, counsel for McNamara, who submitted that the document was both misleading and confusing. He submitted that in all of the circumstances and, contrary to the import of the question put to Det. Phillips, the document did not evidence “association” (for want of a better term) through telecommunications between the deceased and McNamara.
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that the document was relevant and admissible on a number of bases. Firstly, he submitted that it was relevant to what he described as the ""nature and quality of the relationship between the deceased and the accused McNamara"". Secondly, he submitted that the document was capable of sustaining an inference that the accused and the deceased had a particular means of communication with each other. Thirdly, he submitted that the document was capable of sustaining an inference that McNamara was at particular locations at particular times. Finally, he submitted that the document was capable of establishing that McNamara was ""tech savvy"", and a regular user of the internet.
	
	
	The evidence explaining the nature of GPRS data is essentially confined to those passages of Ms Sofrenic's evidence to which I earlier referred. I was not referred to any other passage(s) of her evidence in which the subject of GPRS data was touched upon.
	
	
	Clearly, and without intending any disrespect to Ms Sofrenic, knowledge of the nature of GPRS data is not required to allow her to perform part of her duties as an analyst. She is not an expert. She has, on her own admission, what only could be described as a very basic knowledge of GPRS data, essentially limited to the fact that it refers to internet usage. If the data refers to internet usage by two separate individuals, it is difficult to determine how the document could be said to go to the nature and quality of a relationship between those individuals.
	
	
	The paucity of evidence as to the nature of GPRS data is that the document in its present form, at its highest, shows individual internet usage by the accused and by the deceased, independently of each other. It does not infer, much less establish, that the deceased and McNamara were communicating with each other by way of the internet. To that extent, the document, or more specifically the form in which it has been produced, is in my view positively misleading.
	
	
	To the extent the document is said to be evidence of locations at which McNamara was present from time to time, there has been some evidence given in that regard by Petine Tuhukava, an analyst for Vodafone Hutchison Australia, who was called by the Crown on 1 April 2016. Ms Tuhukava (commencing at T2857 L50) explained, in very basic terms, the nature of the network which operates to facilitate mobile telephone coverage. If the document now sought to be tendered were used for the purposes of establishing that McNamara was in a particular location at a particular time, the evidence of the nature of the operation of the network would have to be far more detailed.
	
	
	For all of these reasons, the probative value of the document is severely limited. It should be excluded under s. 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) on the basis that such probative value it might have is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to McNamara, as well as by the danger that it is both misleading and confusing.
	
	
	That does not prevent Mr Thomas from cross-examining McNamara about his whereabouts on particular dates and at particular times. Similarly, it does not prevent Mr Thomas from cross-examining McNamara about his use of the internet, nor does it prevent Mr Thomas cross-examining McNamara about his association with Mr Gao. It also does not prevent Mr Thomas, if he wishes to do so, calling a telecommunications expert in his own case to give further evidence in relation to the matters to which I have referred, so as to make the document admissible.

		15 June 2016",2016-04-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701769,Sorensen v R [2016] NSWCCA 54,"Judgment


	
	WARD JA: On 15 October 2013, following a trial in the District Court at Parramatta, Michael Sorensen was found guilty by a jury of four offences relating to an assault on the complainant (Ms L). He was tried on a joint indictment with a co-accused, Timothy Hall. Mr Hall was also found guilty of the charges brought against him.
	
	
	Count one on the indictment related to Mr Hall alone. Count two related to Mr Sorensen alone. The other three counts raised charges jointly against the two. The counts relevant to Mr Sorensen, on each of which he was convicted, may be summarised as follows:
	



	
	being armed with a weapon (a baseball bat and a knife) with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to assault Ms L, contrary to s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (count 2);
	
	
	while in company with Mr Hall, indecent assault on Ms L contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act (count 3);
	
	
	while in company with Mr Hall, assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Ms L, contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act (count 4); and
	
	
	while in company with Mr Hall, detaining Ms L with intent to obtain an advantage, namely “to obtain gratification by punishing and humiliating her”, occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act (count 5).
	



	
	The maximum penalty for each of counts 2-4 was 7 years’ imprisonment; for the offence the subject of count 5 it was 25 years’ imprisonment. Mr Sorensen was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2013, with a non-parole period of 8 years expiring on 23 May 2021. The indicated sentences for Mr Sorensen were 3 years for being armed with intent to assault, 3 years for indecent assault in company (with an indicated non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months); 3 years and 3 months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company; and 10 years for the count of specially aggravated detain for advantage. It can be seen from the indicated sentences that there was a high degree of concurrency in the overall aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Mr Hall, who was also sentenced in relation to an offence of supply amphetamine – the supply being to one or more of those present on the subject occasion – received the same aggregate sentence. His Honour noted that Mr Sorensen had a more serious record but the counter factor to that was that Mr Hall, who was younger, had had the initiating role and had engaged in concerted gratuitous and repeated brutality as well as supplying a prohibited drug.
	
	
	By notice of appeal filed on 31 July 2015, Mr Sorensen raised one ground of appeal against conviction (an unreasonable verdict ground) and two grounds of appeal against sentence. During the course of argument in this Court, an application was made for leave to amend the grounds of appeal to include an additional ground of appeal against sentence. The Crown did not oppose the application and leave was given to amend the notice of appeal to include that additional ground.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal, as amended, are as follows:
	


(1)   The jury verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.

(2)   In sentencing the appellant the judge erred in finding the “quasi vigilante” nature of the offending an aggravating factor.

(2A)   In sentencing the appellant the learned judge erred in taking into account the vigilante nature of the offence as an aggravating factor because an element of the offence charged pursuant to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act was “to obtain gratification by punishing and humiliating” the complainant.

(3)   The sentence(s) imposed were manifestly excessive.

Crown case at trial


	
	By way of overview, the Crown’s submissions summarised the case at trial broadly as follows.
	
	
	On 5 April 2012, Ms L, with two other women (Raquel and Michelle), drove from Wollongong to the Pioneer Tavern in Penrith to meet Mr Hall (someone known to Raquel). (Neither Raquel or Michelle was called to give evidence at the trial.) When they left the Pioneer Tavern, they drove to a number of places including Mr Sorensen’s house (where the assaults against Ms L occurred) and Mr Hall’s house. (I interpose to note that Ms L gave evidence that at both those places she smoked some of the drug “ice” with Mr Hall.)
	
	
	While the group was at Mr Hall’s house, one or more of the women tried to steal some jewellery that belonged to Mr Hall’s mother (Ms Turner). When they went back to Mr Sorensen’s house, the other two women told Mr Hall that Ms L had stolen the jewellery. It was the Crown case that, as a result of that allegation, Ms L was hit, punched, forced to remove her clothes, touched around her breasts and her stomach, and told to lie on the floor and crawl around like a dog. Ms L gave evidence that a number of threats were made to her and that she feared for her life. She suffered a number of injuries.
	
	
	At some point during the course of the assaults at Mr Sorensen’s house the other two women left. In the morning, Ms L was forced to drive to Ms Turner’s house where she was made to apologise for having stolen the jewellery. Mr Hall, Mr Sorensen and Ms L then went to a service station to put petrol in the car, at which point Ms L was able to make her escape.
	
	
	The precise time line of the relevant events is not altogether clear.
	
	
	Ms L gave evidence that she and the other two women left Wollongong at about 6pm on 4 April 2012; that it took around about 2 to 3 hours before they got to the Pioneer Tavern; and that they were still around the area of the Pioneer Tavern around 11-12 o’clock that night. After going to various places, including Mr Hall’s house where the jewellery was taken, the group ended up at Mr Sorensen’s house (for the second time that evening). Ms L’s evidence (consistent with what, according to the doctor who later examined Ms L in hospital, she reported after her escape) was that she was first assaulted at about 2.30am/3am. The visit to Ms Turner’s house was in the morning. There was some conflict in the evidence as to whether it was still dark when the three went to Ms Turner’s house. Ms Turner placed the visit as being at about 6.30-7am in the morning, which is consistent with the evidence of a woman who lived in a granny flat at the property (Ms Marshall). A visit at around that time is also consistent with the time at which a bystander (Ms Maybury) assisted to jump start Ms L’s car outside Ms Turner’s house before the group went to the service station and with the time at which the group ended up at Werrington service station and Mr Sorensen and Mr Hall were arrested.
	
	
	The events at the service station occurred at about 7.45am. Mr Sorensen was arrested at that time. Ms L was taken to Nepean Hospital. According to the hospital records she presented for examination at the hospital at about 8.24am on 5 April 2012.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the course of sentencing, the trial judge found that the period of detention was for some hours from some indeterminate time after midnight and concluding sometime after daylight on the day the arrests were recorded by the police.
	


Conviction appeal – ground 1 – unreasonable verdict


	
	As noted above, the sole ground of appeal against conviction is that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
	
	
	In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 (at [14] and [21]), a majority of the High Court (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, with Heydon and Crennan JJ dissenting), referring to the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 (at 493) and to what was said in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 (at [58]) as to the application of that test in the context of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), confirmed that what is required where there is a challenge to conviction on an unreasonable verdict ground is that the appellate court make an independent assessment of the evidence both as to its sufficiency and quality in order to determine whether the evidence was such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences with which the appellant was charged.
	
	
	In Jones v The Queen [1997] HCA 56; (1997) 191 CLR 439 the plurality at 450 (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) said, as to the test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory:
	


In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said that the test for an unsafe or unsatisfactory verdict was whether the court thought that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was ""open to the jury"" to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that:

""in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""

The majority judges explained the application of the test as follows:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.""

Gaudron J agreed with the majority formulation of the test, as did Brennan J, although his Honour said that the question as to whether it was ""open to the jury"" to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt was to be resolved by asking whether the jury was ""upon the whole of the evidence ... bound to have a reasonable doubt"" or whether ""the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused"".

McHugh J said that the correct test for determining whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable was ""whether a reasonable jury must have had a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt"". McHugh J did not adopt the ""open to the jury"" test because his Honour thought that such a test came ""perilously close to applying the test for determining whether there was a sufficiency of evidence to convict the accused"" and would constitute ""an unwarranted intrusion into the jury's right to determine the facts in a criminal trial"". However, the test formulated by the majority in M must now be accepted as the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. (references omitted)


	
	In the present case, the principal witness for the Crown was, unsurprisingly, the complainant, Ms L, and it was accepted by the Crown in opening to the jury at the trial that unless the jury accepted Ms L’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt the Crown case could not succeed. The trial judge also emphasised to the jury in summing up the caution that was required in that regard and there is no complaint as to the directions that were given by his Honour.
	
	
	Evidence was also adduced from each of Ms Turner, Ms Marshall and Ms Maybury, as well as from various police officers and from Dr Samiha Anver, the intern who examined Ms L in the emergency department of the Nepean Hospital.
	
	
	CCTV footage taken from the service station was shown to the jury. This Court was not asked to review that footage. It does not seem to be disputed that the footage showed, among other things, Mr Sorensen attempting to reverse Ms L’s car rapidly away from the petrol bowsers after Ms L ran away from the car. In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge described the CCTV footage as being of a compelling nature, depicting both Ms L’s state of “extreme distress” and “the desperately dangerous conduct of the two offenders”. That conclusion is supported by a review of the police evidence, particularly that of Constable Connolly, who said that the car nearly ran him over and that he had leant in through the window and taken the keys out of the ignition. Constable Connolly described Ms L as crouching with her back to the petrol bowser crying hysterically. The Crown relied upon this evidence both as support for Ms L’s allegations and as evidence of flight consistent with consciousness of guilt. (For Mr Sorensen it is noted that Mr Hall had drugs in the car and had been using ice and it was submitted that this was an alternative explanation for the flight that was inconsistent with guilt.)
	
	
	A transcript of an electronically recorded police interview (ERISP) in which Mr Sorensen had participated was tendered in evidence (though only against him). In that interview he denied that he had intimidated or assaulted anyone. Neither of Mr Hall and Mr Sorensen, as was their right, gave evidence in their defence.
	
	
	In essence, it is Mr Sorensen’s contention on this appeal that, having regard to the demonstrated inaccuracies or falsities, admitted lies, and inconsistencies in the evidence given by Ms L, this Court would not be satisfied that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the respective offences with which he was charged.
	
	
	Addressing that submission requires a review of the whole of Ms L’s evidence (which was, perhaps charitably, described by the trial judge at one stage, in the absence of the jury, as problematic), in light of the other evidence that was before the jury. Nevertheless, the particular aspects of Ms L’s evidence to which Mr Sorensen points in this regard can be summarised as being: her evidence as to the reason that she drove from Wollongong to Penrith in the first place; her evidence as to the nature and severity of the assault and the injuries she sustained; and her evidence as to what transpired at Ms Turner’s house shortly before Mr Hall and Mr Sorensen were arrested at the service station.
	


General comments about Ms L’s evidence


	
	There are, of course, obvious limitations in reviewing transcripts of evidence without having the benefit of seeing the witnesses give their evidence in the witness box. Nevertheless, in SKA, the majority considered that “[t]he account given and the language used by witnesses, which are available by way of transcript, are usually sufficient for a review of evidence” ([31]).
	
	
	From observations made by his Honour during the course of the trial, as recorded on the transcript, it appears that his Honour considered that at times Ms L had a tendency to talk fast (not always seeming to focus carefully on the questions being asked of her) and that occasionally she and Counsel were speaking over each other. This can be gleaned from various statements made by his Honour in the course of the trial as to the manner in which Ms L was giving her evidence: his Honour referring to the need for Ms L to slow down during the course of her examination in chief, suggesting that she just listen to the questions and think about them before answering and requesting that she not speak over Counsel. It was not always apparent to his Honour that Ms L understood the way in which questions put to her were phrased.
	
	
	In the witness box, Ms L expanded in various respects on the content of her earlier statements (the three statements that were given by her to the police – the first on 5 April 2012; the second on 13 September 2012 and the third, shortly before the trial, in September 2013) – so, for example, her evidence that Mr Hall was upset at an earlier stage in the evening because she would not give him a “head job” and that when she was being kicked by Mr Hall she had thrown back at him the “ice” that she had been given (this last piece of evidence in the context of it being suggested to her that she was in possession of “ice” when at the service station – and that she was running from and attempting to hide from the police). Similarly, Mr Sorensen points out that it was not until her third statement that Ms L made any mention of the grabbing of her breast, referring to the fact that Dr Anver had recorded Ms L as having reported at the hospital that nothing of a sexual nature had occurred.
	
	
	Ms L offered a range of explanations for changes in her statements or where she gave evidence of matters not in one or more of her statements, such as that she had not understood that she had to make a comprehensive statement at the time, or had only later recalled certain things, or that if she had given a full account of the evening her statement would have been much longer. Unfamiliarity with the legal process is one thing. However, the proffering of additional details for the first time in the course of her evidence at trial does raise an issue as to the reliability of that evidence. Ms L also explained inconsistencies as to matters such as who had done what to her by reference to her physical or emotional state at the relevant time.
	
	
	On paper, some of Ms L’s answers in cross-examination suggest that she became defensive and at times argumentative, such as when pressed on inconsistencies between her evidence and the statements she had given to police; for example, her response to the question how many times she was kicked, which was to the effect that if she knew she had to remember the number she would have counted (“one kick, two kick” etc.). On one occasion she refused to answer a question (relating to the status of her driver’s licence at the time of the offence), which led the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, to caution her for contempt. On another occasion, she accused Counsel of being a liar in what appears to have been an emotional outburst at the suggestion put to her by him that she was a liar. She seems to have been offended at what she perceived to be the suggestion by Counsel for Mr Hall that she was a “packet slut” (a term she understood to describe a woman “that’s hanging out for crack [and] will sleep with someone just for a packet”; a “packet” being half a “point” of the drug) and to have been at pains both to justify her drug usage (as her one “luxury”) and to assert that “I’ve paid every cent, I’ve never had to rob anybody or anything like that for it [ice]”.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the manner in which Ms L gave evidence was something that the jury was best placed to assess, being able to observe exchanges of the above kind as they occurred and to form an opinion as to whether Ms L was being obstructive or evasive when she was giving her evidence and whether she appeared stressed or drug-affected (and how reliable her evidence was as a consequence).
	
	
	On the second day of Ms L giving evidence, the manner in which she did so led the trial judge to query (in the absence of the jury) whether she might have been affected by some illicit substance (a question put to Ms L and denied by her). An adjournment was granted later that day after Ms L had said that she felt unwell and had expressed an inability to concentrate, saying there were moments when she just “shut down”. The day before, in the course of the cross-examination by Counsel for Mr Sorensen, after being pressed on the inconsistencies as to her statements, Ms L had also requested a break, saying that she was getting a headache. Again, the jury was best placed to assess matters of this kind and it had the benefit of a summing up that drew to the jury’s attention the various inconsistencies and matters on which the defence relied as establishing the unreliability of her evidence.
	
	
	I will address the particular aspects of Ms L’s evidence that Mr Sorensen, in written submissions, pointed to as demonstrating that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence under three headings: first, the evidence as to the nature and severity of Ms L’s injuries; second, the inconsistencies between Ms L’s evidence in the witness box and her earlier statements; and, third, the areas in which there is an apparent conflict between Ms L’s evidence and that of other witnesses.
	


Nature and severity of Ms L’s injuries


	
	Dr Anver gave evidence mainly by reference to a statement she had prepared from her contemporaneous hospital notes. Relevantly, however, she did have an independent recollection at the time she gave evidence of particular matters (such as the appearance of the bruising on Ms L’s face, the shoe prints on her back, and some of the history she had recounted to her).
	
	
	Her evidence was that Ms L presented in the emergency department at the Nepean Hospital at approximately 8.24am on 5 April 2012. Dr Anver was then an intern in her second placement at the hospital and she was the medical officer who examined Ms L.
	
	
	Dr Anver’s evidence was that Ms L had reported to her that: she had been involved in an assault at around 3am that morning; she had been hit repeatedly in the face, back of the head, ribs, stomach, back and legs; and the beating continued for a number of hours but she remained conscious at all times. She recorded that Ms L had complained of a nose bleed that had ceased by the time she presented to the hospital and that at the hospital she was complaining of a headache, face pain, pain in her left hand, soreness around her ribs and a burning sensation across her back that she attributed to an open flame being held close to her back.
	
	
	Dr Anver gave evidence that there was bruising around both Ms L’s eyes and her eyelids appeared swollen and purple coloured bilaterally. Dr Anver said that she actually remembered the appearance of that bruising and that it was quite visible. It extended over both her eyes as well as over the nasal bridge. She said the eyes were swollen as well. She could see the swelling clearly and said that it was apparent from a distance. She said that there appeared to be more swelling around the left eye in comparison with the right and that the left eye appeared “injected red”, which she explained as being that the whole of the eye appeared a bit red consistent with trauma to the face causing minor bleeding in the eye. The redness was not visible from the same distance as the bruising to Ms L’s face.
	
	
	There was a small bruise on the back of Ms L’s left hand, which was tender to touch, and a 6.7mm bruise to the back of her head on the left side, which was also tender to touch, with no break to the overlying skin. Her left cheek bone was tender to palpation. X-rays were taken which revealed that there was no evidence of acute bony injury in the facial bones or left hand.
	
	
	Significantly, Dr Anver gave evidence that there were three shoe prints on Ms L’s upper back, which was “mildly erythematous” (i.e. mildly pink in appearance). Dr Anver said that she could see the outline of three shoe prints. She said that, from recollection, it was the top half of the shoe in three different positions on half her back. She clarified this as saying that it was not just an outline; it was a pressure mark that had a shoe pattern to it. There were no burns visible on Ms L’s back.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Dr Anver agreed that Ms L had olive coloured skin and that the bruising around the eyes was just around the eyelids and just below the eye but did not accept that the colour of the bruising on Ms L’s face and the type of swelling she saw could be explained by someone not having slept for a day or two and using the drug ice (a suggestion put to her by defence counsel). She accepted that the bruising and swelling to the face was consistent with Ms L having been struck one to three times in the face but said she could not say how many times Ms L had been struck. She agreed that the bruising to the face was consistent with her having been struck by a male and/or a female and was unable to say which.
	
	
	As to the redness on the back, Dr Anver could not say how long it had been there but said that in the context of its appearance her assumption was that it would have been a short period of time. While she accepted that she was aware (at the time she examined her back) of the history recounted to her by Ms L, her explanation for the assumption that the redness of her back had only been there a short time seems to be found in her statement that it did not look like an infectious cause of redness and thus she assumed that it would not have been there for a very long period of time. She considered it unlikely to have occurred the day before and said that it looked more acute than having happened a couple of days ago. (For completeness, I note that she also accepted that a possible cause of the redness was rubbing of the back, but there is nothing to suggest that this was a likely alternative explanation for the redness and would not in any event explain the presence of the shoe prints or marks on her back.) Dr Anver confirmed that she saw no evidence of burning on Ms L’s back, neck or body.
	
	
	Dr Anver agreed that there was no record in her notes of Ms L having been hit with a hammer or baseball bat or of being threatened with a baseball bat or knife; and that there were no marks or imprints on her wrists consistent with having been handcuffed. A possible explanation for the former is Dr Anver’s evidence that in the emergency department, the focus was on medical considerations, not on the history of what had happened. Her notes recorded that Ms L had denied any history of sexual assault but Dr Anver did recall her saying that she had been stripped naked and that she was crawling on the ground.
	
	
	Dr Anver gave evidence as to the amnesic testing carried out at the hospital on Ms L to determine whether she had suffered a frank head injury or loss of memory or understanding. She agreed that within 25 minutes of being admitted to hospital Ms L’s amnesic score was normal and that Ms L was discharged at about 3.12pm after amnesic testing had been carried out three times since her admission with normal results (evidence that belies Ms L’s own evidence as to her state when she left the hospital and went to the police station to give her first statement).
	
	
	Although Dr Anver had initially recorded in her notes that Ms L had lost consciousness, she said she had changed that to “lost vision” because she had clarified with Ms L that what she was referring to as a blackout was blackness of vision as opposed to loss of consciousness.
	
	
	Dr Anver said there was nothing about Ms L’s presentation that raised the possibility of the diagnosis of her being in a psychotic state.
	
	
	Mr Sorensen concedes that the medical evidence was that Ms L suffered “some injuries” consistent with “some” of what she said had happened to her but submits (as his Honour accepted) that the minor nature of her injuries was generally inconsistent with what she said had happened. It is submitted for Mr Sorensen that most of the injuries were consistent with the fight that Ms L admitted having had that evening with Michelle.
	
	
	Ms L’s evidence of that fight was that it was a “fist fight” that occurred after Mr Hall had confronted her as to what she had taken from his house and had kicked her in the face and then in the belly. She said that Michelle was “smirking” at her. She could not estimate how many punches Michelle had thrown. She thought that some of the punches Michelle had thrown did connect with her but said “I couldn’t say cause there was so much going on. I was sort of you know, angry, in pain, everything”. She said that the fight with Michelle “wasn’t that long” and that Mr Sorensen had grabbed her by the hair and threatened to pull her off the ground by her hair if she did not stop hitting Michelle. In cross-examination, Ms L denied that Michelle had punched her nose or in the face and said that she had “probably just [punched] around my arms, trying to block me as well and trying to punch me”. She denied that Michelle had caused her nose to bleed. She said that she got a bleeding nose after Mr Hall “was kicking me constantly, while I was sitting naked on the floor”.
	
	
	It was not put to Ms L that Michelle (or Raquel for that matter) had stomped on or kicked her in the back. Nor was there any suggestion that the bruise to the back of Ms L’s head was caused by any punches thrown by Michelle.
	
	
	The Crown argues that Ms L’s evidence as to her fight with Michelle did not provide an anodyne explanation for the presence of most of the main injuries referred to by Dr Anver. I agree.
	
	
	It is impossible not to conclude that Ms L greatly exaggerated both the extent of the assault and the severity of her injuries in the aftermath of the assault. Had she been forcefully kicked and punched constantly for some hours (as she said), there would surely have been more significant bruising and swelling on her face and other areas of the body and likely some lacerations, if not worse injuries. Had her hair (or back) actually been burnt one might have expected some evidence of it (though I note that her evidence can in places be read as consistent with heat from a flame being applied near, but not actually to or on, her back, which would not necessarily leave a burn mark on the skin). Had she been as dizzy and unbalanced as she says she was when she left the hospital, it is difficult to accept that she would have been discharged when she was; but in any event, her evidence in this regard is inconsistent with her performance on the amnesic tests over the period from her admission through to her discharge from hospital. Had she been as incapacitated after the event as she said she was (i.e., incapable of leaving the house and having to hold onto the walls just to leave her bedroom) it is difficult to see how she could have been in a state to pass her driving test, as she did, a mere five days after she was discharged from the hospital.
	
	
	However, exaggeration as to those matters does not gainsay that there was independent medical evidence that confirmed that Ms L had sustained injuries consistent with a violent assault. In particular, Dr Anver’s evidence as to the outline of shoe prints on three different places on her back provides powerful support for Ms L’s allegation that Mr Hall had stomped on her back. The redness of her back is consistent with that having happened. While Dr Anver accepted that the pressure marks in the shape of the top part of a shoe might have been made by a man or a woman and was unable to determine which, there was no suggestion that the fist fight with Michelle extended to Michelle stomping on Ms L’s back.
	
	
	It was open to the jury to accept Ms L’s evidence as to the stomping on her back and hence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was one of the men who left the shoe imprints on Ms L’s back. Although there was some confusion in Ms L’s evidence as to who was the “he” that she said had hit her with the hammer and was on her back, ultimately she was adamant that it was Mr Sorensen who had hit her with the hammer and applied heat to her back and Mr Hall who had stomped on her back.
	
	
	I interpose also to note that Ms L’s evidence as to Mr Sorensen standing with the baseball bat and knife and threatening to crack her over the head with the baseball bat is consistent with the presence of a baseball bat near the stairs in his house where a sample of her blood was found.
	


Inconsistencies between Ms L’s evidence and her earlier statements


	
	In written submissions for Mr Sorensen it is submitted that Ms L admitted lying on oath about aspects of her evidence and that she admitted there were a number of “errors” in what was recorded in her initial police statement. The Crown takes issue with the suggestion that Ms L admitted that she had lied on her oath (as opposed to having admitted that she had lied in some parts of her police statements, as she did for example, in relation to that part of her second police statement in which she said until they got back in the car she thought the other women had put the rings back in the cupboard). Nevertheless, the Crown accepts that lies to the police may properly be taken into account in assessing Ms L’s credibility. (The Crown also notes that there were various occasions in cross-examination where it was put to Ms L that she was lying and she denied this but nothing turns on these denials.)
	
	
	As to the inconsistencies between Ms L’s statements to the police and her evidence at the trial, the first was as to the nature of Ms L’s acquaintance with the two women with whom she had driven to Penrith. In cross-examination, Ms L admitted that her statement to the police on 5 April 2012 that “I drove up to Sydney and met up with two friends, Raquel and Michelle. I don’t know their last names” was untrue. Ms L accepted that she had driven up to Penrith with the two women; that she did know Raquel’s last name; and that Raquel was her drug supplier. She had earlier (in her second statement) corrected the reference to Raquel being a friend. She said that Raquel was not a “friend” but someone she knew through others and said hello and goodbye to but little more. (I consider the import of this admitted lie in the context of the third matter to which Mr Sorensen points in this regard.)
	
	
	Next, it is submitted that Ms L claimed falsely that the police took video footage of her at the hospital. (I note that this was one instance where, in the course of what seems to have been a lengthy justification for making the incorrect statement referred to at [52] above, Ms L volunteered something apparently not contained in any of her earlier statements.) Ultimately, however, little can be taken from the fact that, contrary to her evidence, there was no video footage taken of Ms L in the hospital, since there was evidence that a mobile phone or recording device had been used to take an audio recording of the interview in hospital and it is entirely possible that Ms L simply misunderstood the nature of the recording there being taken.
	
	
	Next, Mr Sorensen points to the evidence given by Ms L that she drove to Sydney because she had just got her licence and wanted to take her car out on a long drive. (In the course of her first answer to that effect Ms L also added “and to help Raquel pick up Timmy [Mr Hall] and bring him down to Wollongong because she wanted to bring him down” and she was adamant that the main reason for the trip was to help Raquel.)
	
	
	There are two points to note in relation to this aspect of the evidence. First, it was established through the production of the relevant records that Ms L did not obtain her provisional driver’s licence until after the incident. Hence the claim that as at 4 April 2015 she had just got her licence was demonstrably incorrect. Ms L was cross-examined by Counsel for Mr Hall at some length both as to this issue and as to the fact that she had later undertaken a driving test, which she passed, on 10 April 2012, at a time when she claimed she was too traumatised to leave the house, was losing her balance and was not able to focus. Ms L’s attempts to explain why it was that she had said she had just got her licence at a time when she had not yet passed her driver’s licence test strain credulity to say the least (including that she was not referring in her evidence to her provisional driver’s licence, that she had her learner’s permit, and that she did not know that she had not passed an earlier driving test until she found out about this later in the mail). It also led to Ms L’s seemingly defiant evidence as to her being comfortable driving to pick up Raquel (before the trip to Sydney) without a driver’s licence.
	
	
	The second point to note is that the statement that she had just got her driver’s licence was made in the context of giving a reason for her drive to Sydney. Ms L was cross-examined again at some length as to the purpose of her drive to Sydney. Ms L at first denied that she drove the women to Penrith in the hope that she could score some drugs but later said that she was “hoping” that Raquel would give her a little bit of ice for the drive (this hope having been referred to in her second police statement of 13 September 2012). Cross-examination in this regard by Counsel for Mr Sorensen was directed to whether the only or principal reason Ms L drove to Sydney that night was to get some drugs – a proposition denied by Ms L, who maintained that the principal or main reason that she drove to Sydney that night was to take Raquel there to pick up Mr Hall.
	
	
	Ms L’s clearly incorrect claim to have driven to Sydney at a time when she had just got her driver’s licence, and her admitted lies to the police as to the nature of her acquaintance with Raquel, are nevertheless explicable by what Ms L ultimately conceded in cross-examination, namely that she wanted to disassociate herself from any criminal activity. (Similarly, Ms L accepted in cross-examination that her statement to police that until she got into the car to leave Mr Hall’s house she believed that the rings had been returned by the other women – inconsistent with her evidence that the women had stuffed the rings into her bra and that she left the house with them in her bra – was an untruth that she accepted in cross-examination was an attempt to disassociate herself from criminal activity.)
	
	
	In any event, those inconsistencies and untruths to the police do not require a conclusion that Ms L was not be believed as to what she said had occurred later during the course of the early hours of 5 April 2012. It was open to the jury to believe Ms L on the essential aspects of her account of those events, particularly having regard to the medical evidence.
	
	
	The next aspect of Ms L’s evidence where there was some inconsistency with her earlier statements was as to who had done what to her at Mr Sorensen’s house. It was put to her (though she disagreed) that in her first statement to police on 5 April 2012 she had said that “Tim jumped on my back, he hit my fingers with a hammer”. Confusion seems to have then arisen because of the use of the word “he” in her statement, rather than naming the man in question. In the witness box she said that what she had meant was that Mr Sorensen had hit her hand with a hammer. Similarly, she said that the further statement in that first police statement that “he burnt my back with a butane lighter” was not a reference to Mr Hall.
	
	
	In later cross-examination by Counsel for Mr Hall, Ms L at one stage agreed that the above references to “he” in her earlier statement were to Mr Hall but then accused Counsel of having misheard her and was adamant that it was Mr Sorensen who was burning her back and her hair and that Mr Hall was on her back stomping on her. A review of the transcript in this regard suggests to me that Ms L was confused when she was trying to explain what was meant in her initial police statement by “he” but overall she had identified Mr Sorensen as the person who had the hammer and was burning her back and Mr Hall as the person who had stood on her back.
	
	
	There was also cross-examination by Counsel for Mr Sorensen as to the fact that in her earlier statements of 5 April 2012 and 13 September 2012, Ms L had not stated that Mr Sorensen had stood in front of the front door of the house holding a baseball bat and a knife. Ms L was asked to accept that the first time she told anyone that Mr Sorensen was holding a knife and a baseball bat was when she made her third statement on 24 September 2013. It is fair to say that there was scope for some confusion on the part of Ms L as to what it was that was being suggested to her had not appeared until her third statement. It was certainly something that the trial judge thought should be clarified (as it subsequently was).
	
	
	It was then accepted by Counsel for Mr Sorensen that Ms L had said in her first statement that Mr Sorensen was holding a baseball bat; and that what was not in the earlier statements was that he was also holding a knife. Whatever the explanation for this, it does not preclude the jury accepting Ms L’s evidence that Mr Sorensen had threatened her and concluding beyond reasonable doubt that he was part of the joint criminal activity with Mr Hall. While Counsel for Mr Sorensen notes that Ms L’s evidence was that Mr Sorensen never touched her at any time with a baseball bat, Ms L’s DNA was detected on the baseball bat (which was found near the blood stain below the stairs in Mr Sorensen’s house) and there was evidence from a forensic police officer as to the possibility of secondary transference of DNA from a person to an object.
	
	
	There was also an issue raised in cross-examination of Ms L as to her evidence that she had been tied with cable ties and then handcuffed. No cable ties were found at Mr Sorensen’s house. Two sets of handcuffs were found in Mr Sorensen’s bedroom. DNA extracted from swabs taken on the handcuffs originated from at least three individuals. The major component identified from the inside and outside had the same DNA profile as Mr Sorensen. Ms L’s DNA was not detected on the handcuffs.
	
	
	As to the absence of cable ties, that of itself is not sufficient to give rise to a reasonable doubt as to Mr Sorensen’s guilt. Ms L could have been mistaken as to this; she might (as she clearly did on other matters relating to the injuries she had sustained) have been exaggerating. As to the handcuffs, the fact that they were not found in the car is not inconsistent with Ms L’s evidence that they were removed in the car, since her evidence was also that the group had returned to the house when the car would not start at that point and therefore it is possible that the handcuffs were returned to the house at that stage. Ms L’s evidence was that she did not know what had happened to them. As to the absence of DNA linked to Ms L’s profile on the handcuffs, the forensic evidence was that there was other DNA on the handcuffs but it could not be identified. Dr Anver’s evidence was that there were no marks on Ms L’s wrists consistent with the use of handcuffs but it is unclear whether there would necessarily have been such marks if the handcuffs had been used only for a short period of time.
	
	
	When the other medical evidence is taken into account, the possibilities raised by the evidence in relation to the lack of cable ties and the handcuffs are not such as to give rise to reasonable doubt as to the convictions.
	
	
	Finally, there was some inconsistency in Ms L’s accounts of how much of the drug “ice” she had consumed on the night and as to her habitual level of drug use based on Dr Anver’s note of what she had told her at the hospital.
	
	
	Ms L said she did not have any ice with her that night and that she had “a smoke of ice” with Mr Hall when she first arrived at Mr Sorensen’s house. In her first police statement she said that she only had about “two puffs” there. She said that she had a “little smoke” with Mr Hall when they returned to Mr Hall’s house after they had put some petrol in the car. She said that she had smoked “a couple of puffs” there. She accepted that nowhere in the first statement did she record that she had smoked any more ice after the two puffs at Mr Sorensen’s house.
	
	
	Dr Anver confirmed that the hospital notes recorded Ms L as having said that she usually smoked around five points of ice over two to three days. Ms L said in the witness box that that must have been an error and that she probably smoked that amount of ice over a fortnight. Dr Anver’s evidence, as already noted, was that there was nothing in her presentation at the hospital to give rise to a diagnosis that she was psychotic.
	
	
	Ms L’s evidence was that she smoked about one and a half “points” over two or three days and that she was a “once a payday” user. She said she had been using ice for 15 years. She agreed that she had occasionally experienced her thinking becoming confused but said that was not all the time and that she did not have delusions or hallucinations. She admitted that she was a regular, not casual, user. There was some confusion in her answers as to whether she would describe herself as a heavy user of the drug.
	
	
	The trial judge in summing up drew Ms L’s admitted consumption of ice to the jury’s attention as a significant issue to be considered going to the reliability of her evidence. His Honour suggested that the jury might want to consider whether they were comfortable to accept that she had only had a few puffs of the drug during the course of the evening and, further, whether they might want to consider whether or not Ms L’s consumption of drugs had the potential to affect her conduct in some of the ways that had been suggested by the defence as being bizarre and inconsistent. No complaint was made as to the summing up in this regard.
	
	
	In the circumstances, it was open to the jury to accept Ms L’s evidence as to the relatively small quantity of ice she said she had consumed on the night (compared with the amount she said that she regularly consumed) and, notwithstanding her admitted drug use, to have concluded that her account of the events was reliable in light of the supporting medical evidence and their observations (from the CCTV footage) of the state she was in when she was at the service station.
	


Conflict between Ms L’s evidence and that of other witnesses


	
	Mr Sorensen points in this regard to the evidence of Ms Turner, Ms Maybury and Ms Marshall.
	
	
	Ms Turner gave evidence as to the events that occurred when Ms L came to her house with Mr Hall and Mr Sorensen. She says that Ms L apologised for stealing the jewellery and said she was on drugs and did not know why she had done it. Ms Turner gave evidence that she had “stern words” with Mr Hall and that she told Ms L never to come back to any of her houses. She says that she then made coffee and that Ms L had a couple of sips of the coffee. At some point the two men went to the backyard outside the house to look at Ms Turner’s dogs (she being a dog breeder). Ms Turner said that Ms L said that she wanted to have a cigarette and that she escorted Ms L out of the front of the house and left her alone near her car for about 10 minutes before Mr Sorensen and Mr Hall joined her. (The relevance of this evidence goes to Ms L’s claim that she was detained.) Ms Turner said that they had trouble starting the car and that she saw all three pushing the car.
	
	
	Ms L denied that Ms Turner had made everyone a cup of coffee; denied that Mr Hall had asked his mother if he could take Mr Sorensen out to look at the dogs; and denied that she was left alone in the kitchen with Ms Turner having a cup of coffee. She also denied going outside to have a cigarette and being alone near her car outside Ms Turner’s house for about 10 to 15 minutes. Her evidence was that Mr Sorensen was with her at all times when she was out the front of Ms Turner’s house.
	
	
	Ms Marshall’s evidence supported that of Ms Turner in relation to the question whether the men had gone outside to look at the dogs. Ms Marshall said that Mr Hall had come to her with another man to look at the dogs and that she had accompanied them. On that version of events, Ms L must have been alone for some time with Ms Turner, whether or not she went outside the house to have a cigarette. On that point, Ms Marshall’s evidence also provided some corroboration of Ms Turner’s account. Ms Marshall did not see Ms L alone outside the house but she did give evidence that when she and the men came back inside after looking at the dogs Ms Turner told Mr Hall that Ms L was outside. There is therefore room for doubt as to whether Ms L’s detention extended beyond the time at which, on both Ms Turner’s and Ms Marshall’s evidence, the men went outside to look at the dogs, but that does not mean that the jury could not have accepted as beyond reasonable doubt Ms L’s evidence that she was detained up until that point. Again that could have been no more than an instance of exaggeration on Ms L’s part. Moreover, in assessing whether there was a reasonable opportunity to escape from Ms Turner’s house one must take into account Ms Turner’s evidence that there were guard dogs in the front yard (which is why she said she had escorted Ms L from the house when Ms L wanted a cigarette).
	
	
	Ms Turner gave evidence that Ms L had apologised for taking the jewellery. Ms L’s evidence was that she did not recall apologising for taking the jewellery. What she did recall saying was put as follows:
	


A.   I did apologise to her at one stage when she was screaming at him [Mr Hall] saying, “That teaches you for dealing – having these drugs or whatever and with these girls”, and I said to her, “I’m sorry he didn’t realise, you know, he trusted us girls going into his house, he didn’t know that we were going to steal anything at her house and I apologise for that”, that’s all I said but I don’t remember – recall apologising or what you said.


	
	Asked to say again what she had said, Ms L said:
	


A.   That I apologised – cause she was screaming at Tim, I told you that – I apologised for us three girls, he didn’t realise that something was going to happen, he trusted me and the three girls to his house and that’s what happened to the house, you know, like someone stole rings from the house. That’s all I apologised for.


	
	Mr Sorensen maintains that even if the apology was in those terms it would be bizarre for someone who had allegedly been bashed, humiliated and traumatised then to defend the offender. The Crown submits, to the contrary, that making an apology in those circumstances could be seen as consistent with Ms L having been intimidated and in fear of further beating. Moreover, just as it is suggested bizarre that Ms L would seek to defend her attacker, it is also somewhat bizarre that Ms Turner would sit down and have a cup of coffee with someone who she says she had just told never to come back to any of her houses again.
	
	
	Obviously there are different interpretations one might make of the fact that Ms L apologised (on whatever terms the actual apology was made) to Ms Turner in relation to the taking of her jewellery. The apology alone does not give rise to reasonable doubt as to Mr Sorensen’s conviction.
	
	
	Finally, Ms Turner (who was called by the Crown and who it sought unsuccessfully to cross-examine as an unfavourable witness) gave evidence in cross-examination by the respective defence Counsel that Ms L did not appear upset or distressed and that Ms L did not appear to have any injuries. She said that Ms L looked “drug affected”, which she explained in re-examination as being that: Ms L’s eyes were glassy, she did not want to look Ms Turner in the face, she was “very stoned” and she looked like a person who was stoned. Ms Turner then went on to say that Ms L did not seem to be upset or nervous or fidgety and that when she spoke to her Ms L answered her “sort of with remorse… like, I’m in trouble, you know, I’m sorry I did that”.
	
	
	As the Crown points out, Ms Turner is the mother of Mr Hall. She was not, therefore, an independent witness in the sense of being a witness with no interest in the outcome of the trial. Her evidence that Ms L did not appear upset or distressed was, as the Crown submits, in stark contrast to the observations made only a short time later by police at the service station. Constable Connolly’s evidence was that he heard a woman screaming “Help me, somebody help me”, then saw Ms L running frantically and then crouched with her back to a petrol bowser. He observed her crying hysterically and sobbing as she attempted to speak.
	
	
	Ms Turner’s evidence that she did not observe any physical injuries (though I note she was seemingly able to observe that Ms L had “glassy eyes”) is simply not credible having regard to the evidence of Dr Anver who examined Ms L in the emergency department of the hospital and who recalled that the bruising and swelling was quite visible. One might assume that if Ms Turner was observant enough to see that Ms L had “glassy eyes” she would also have noticed that one was red but this was not put to her. Given the discrepancy between Ms Turner’s observations and those of Dr Anver and even allowing the bruising and swelling to have worsened between the time Ms L was at Ms Turner’s house and when she was examined at the hospital, it was open to the jury to prefer the medical evidence as being more reliable than that of Ms Turner. It was also open to the jury to give limited weight to the evidence of Ms Turner as to the events of that morning at least where that evidence was not corroborated by other evidence.
	
	
	Even if Ms L was not under the immediate constraint imposed by the presence of the men for a period while they were outside, that did not preclude the jury concluding beyond reasonable doubt that she had been assaulted and detained for the purpose of punishment and humiliation while at Mr Sorensen’s house.
	
	
	As to Ms Maybury, who (unlike Ms Turner and Ms Marshall) was independent of all of the people involved in the incident, she gave evidence that she had assisted to jump start the car with jumper leads provided by the men. She said that, when arriving at work that morning, she had noticed three people (two men and a woman) having difficulty with a car. She said that they were pushing the car trying to start it but, when pressed, could not recall whether each of them was pushing the car. She said that a man came over to ask for assistance and that when she was working with the jumper leads the woman (Ms L) was outside at the back of the car. Ms Maybury did not have any conversation with Ms L, did not see Ms L do anything while she was working with the jumper leads, and did not notice anything particular about Ms L.
	
	
	Her evidence is consistent with the evidence of Ms Marshall that she saw the car being pushed outside Ms Turner’s residence by a female and the two men.
	
	
	Ms L’s evidence was that she had helped to push the car by turning the steering wheel but this was prior to Ms Maybury being asked to assist. Ms L’s evidence was that she was inside the car when Ms Maybury helped to start the car with the use of her battery and jumper leads.
	
	
	The Crown points to the fact that Ms Maybury said she had not paid any particular attention to the three when she arrived at work and submits that in those circumstances the apparent conflict in the evidence as to whether Ms L was inside or outside the car might be the product of an incomplete recollection by Ms Maybury. Alternatively, the Crown submits that if Ms L had been outside the car she may not have raised any alarm for fear of what reprisals might be taken against her. The Crown submits that the tensions created by this aspect of the Crown case (and by the apparent conflict to which the evidence of Ms Marshall gave rise), whether resolved or not, were not sufficient to preclude a verdict of guilty against Mr Sorensen on each of the charges. I agree.
	


Conclusion on ground 1


	
	The Crown pointed to various aspects of the evidence as providing support for the jury verdicts on each count against Mr Sorensen; in particular, the evidence of each of Dr Anver and Constable Connolly but also the forensic evidence (namely that DNA extracted from a swab of blood taken from stairs on the carpet in the hallway of Mr Sorensen’s house matched Ms L’s DNA profile as did DNA extracted from swabs of blood taken from a silver baseball bat that was located near the stains in the hallway cupboard and the fact that various implements consistent with Ms L’s complaints were found at the house, in her car, and on the offenders at the time of their arrest.
	
	
	I have already referred to much of that evidence. As to the implements found at the time of the arrest, Mr Sorensen surrendered a knife (which Constable Connolly said was pushed down the front of his pants); when Mr Hall was searched a silver flip knife was found on him; and a knife was found in the footwell of the rear seat of Ms L’s car behind the driver (as well as a set of jumper leads, a hammer and two screwdrivers). The Crown accepts that the mere fact that those implements were in the car is not of itself significant but submits that it provides some support for Ms L’s contention that she was threatened with such implements.
	
	
	The Crown also places reliance on the evidence of Constable Connolly to the effect that, when police first approached the service station in response to Ms L’s cries for help, Mr Sorensen attempted to flee by driving away from the area in Ms L’s car. The jury, of course, had the benefit of seeing the CCTV recording of the events at the service station (which the trial judge on sentencing referred to as being of a compelling nature).
	
	
	For Mr Sorensen, it is suggested that there was an alternative explanation for the attempted flight, in that Mr Hall was in possession of a quantity of drugs. It is not disputed that a quantity of drugs was found in the car. They presumably were not Ms L’s drugs, since the defence case was that she had gone to Sydney in order to “score” some drugs. There was, however, no evidence as to whether Mr Sorensen was aware that Mr Hall was in possession of drugs or that there were drugs in the car at the time. The trial judge in summing up, having earlier sought submissions from Counsel as to the form of direction that should be made in this regard, referred only to the CCTV footage as a further matter that the Crown said was consistent with its case. There was no complaint about his Honour’s summing up in that regard.
	
	
	Having reviewed the whole of the transcript, there can be no doubt that Ms L’s evidence needed to be approached with a great deal of caution and that she was hardly a reliable witness in a number of respects. The trial judge gave the jury careful directions in that regard and went so far as to note that there was a real issue in the trial as to whether Ms L had lied on a considerable number of occasions. Again, there was no complaint as to those directions.
	
	
	Some of what Ms L said was undeniably incorrect, such as her evidence that she had just got her licence a few days before the events in question. She admitted having lied to the police about various matters (such as her relationship with Raquel and her belief that the other women had put the rings back before leaving Mr Hall’s house). There was some confusion in her evidence as to who had done what to her during her ordeal (namely whether it was Mr Hall or Mr Sorensen who she said had hit her fingers with a hammer or had burnt or threatened to burn her back or hair), though this seems explicable by reference to the confusion on her part as to who she had been referring to as “he” in parts of her earlier police statements. And there can be little doubt that Ms L exaggerated both the nature and extent of the assaults and her subsequent physical state.
	
	
	However, the two matters that in my opinion provide powerful support for the convictions are the medical evidence of shoe prints on Ms L’s back (which Dr Anver considered unlikely to have been inflicted the day before she had examined her) and the evidence of Constable Connolly (apparently confirmed by the CCTV footage) of Ms L’s distress at the time she ran from the car. The former obviously supports the allegations of assault. Both of those matters cast real doubt on the reliability of Ms Turner’s evidence that Ms L did not appear to be injured and was not in any distress only a short time before arriving at the service station.
	
	
	The matters going to Ms L’s credibility and reliability as a witness (such as the lies that Ms L accepted she had made in an attempt to disassociate herself from any criminal activity) were matters that the jury had to weigh against other evidence (such as the medical evidence and the CCTV footage from the service station) that supported Ms L’s claim that she had been the victim of an assault. The jury had the advantage of seeing Ms L give evidence and hence forming an assessment as to whether some of the inconsistencies in her evidence were due to stress at being in the witness box or were an indication that she was dishonest or unreliable in the giving of her evidence as a whole. The jury were also in a position to apply their common sense when considering whether a regular user of ice, who had consumed on her own account only a small amount that evening, might have been delusional or had difficulty in remembering the events, bearing in mind the medical evidence that there was nothing to suggest a diagnosis that she was psychotic.
	
	
	Having considered all of those matters, and bearing in mind the considerable advantage that the jury had in assessing the relevant witnesses, especially Ms L, I consider that it was open to the jury to have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that Ms L was assaulted by being kicked and stomped on (albeit not by being hit with a hammer or having more than some flame applied close to her back), threatened with more dire consequences, and detained without her consent for the period of time commencing from the assaults until at least the time she was at Ms Turner’s house and perhaps (if Ms Turner’s evidence of taking Ms L outside to have a cigarette were to be disbelieved) up to the time of Ms L’s escape at the service station.
	
	
	Therefore, although Ms L was clearly an unsatisfactory witness in a number of respects and some of her allegations (such as the actual burning of her hair and back) were not on the medical evidence established beyond reasonable doubt, I am not persuaded that the guilty verdicts were unreasonable. I would reject ground 1.
	
	
	Since the appeal proceedings were commenced quite some time after expiry of the time for an appeal against conviction without leave (Mr Sorensen having been convicted on 5 October 2013, the time for appeal expired in November 2013; his notice of appeal was filed 31 July 2015), an application to extend the time in which to appeal ought to have been brought.
	
	
	The Crown did not object to an extension of time for the filing of the notice of appeal. In the circumstances, I would extend time for the filing of the notice of appeal to 31 July 2015 and dismiss the conviction appeal.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence

Grounds 2 and 2A


	
	Both these grounds relate to the finding by his Honour that the quasi-vigilante nature of the offence was an aggravating feature and I will deal with them together.
	
	
	First, it is relevant to note the context in which, in his remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to quasi-vigilantism as an aggravating feature.
	
	
	Having made clear those aspects of Ms L’s allegations that his Honour concluded, with regard to the medical evidence, were not made out beyond reasonable doubt (namely that Mr Sorensen had struck Ms L’s hand using the hammer with full force, if at all; that there had been a full application of the blow torch effect obtained by combining an aerosol with flame and then pointing it directly onto her back; and Ms L’s evidence as to the aftermath of her ordeal) and those matters that his Honour did accept beyond reasonable doubt (such as the making of the threats backed by actions that were employed to instil fear; that the marks on Ms L’s back were shoe marks caused by Mr Hall having stood on her back; and that the activities engaged upon in the course of an ongoing assault constituted a degree of gratuitous cruelty by each offender), his Honour went on to observe that “the setting of all of the offences was overshadowed by the inherent and specific gravity of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping”.
	
	
	It was in that context that his Honour addressed each of the factors referred to in R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; (2012) 221 A Crim R 175 (from [106]) with reference to the facts of the present case, namely the length of time of the detention; consideration of how Ms L came to regain her liberty; and whether the level of intimidation escalated.
	
	
	As to the second of those factors, his Honour noted that in Speechley the extent to which fear or terror was occasioned and the manner in which the victim was treated during detention were factors that elevated the objective gravity of the offence; and that the Court there also considered whether the purpose of the detention was for ransom or otherwise.
	
	
	His Honour referred to the condemnation required of offences committed as a form of vigilante action and the relevance of that to reflecting general deterrence on sentence, stating that there were “some aspects” of that factor in the present matter. His Honour then went on to say:
	


In order to avoid any perception of double counting of the aggravating feature and the kidnapping it is necessary that much of the offending will, after individual assessment, require recognition as very serious but also intimately related offending in the course of an ongoing course of criminality. That will require consideration of whether a requisite degree of concurrence is to be applied. The formulation nonetheless leaves any assessment of totality in the criminality for both offenders as very grave, albeit with a dominating concern to properly assess the totality of all the indictment counts within the framework of the related and very serious offences especially aggravated kidnapping. (my emphasis)


	
	Pausing there, in the above passage, in which his Honour clearly had in mind the need to avoid double counting the element of aggravation constituted by the quasi-vigilante nature of the offending, what his Honour was posing was the question of concurrence as between the “intimately related offending” (i.e., the offences in counts 2-4) and the specially aggravated kidnapping, not any double counting that might be involved in treating the quasi-vigilante nature of the offence as an aggravating factor for the offending in count 5.
	
	
	That is made clear later in the course of his Honour’s remarks on sentence where his Honour noted, first, that selecting the appropriate penalty for the individual offences of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (count 2 in Mr Sorensen’s case) required “care and implementation” (perhaps meaning care in implementation) so as to distinguish that offence from the core offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, and then, having referred to the way in which weapons were used in the offending, went on to say:
	


Each of the related joint offending matters that constituted an assault occasioning actual bodily harm was serious in its concerted brutality, if not for any lasting physical effect. That aside, I find that the psychological trauma and harm done was considerable and that is also to be regarded with care as to the reconciliation of both the totality of offending and the need to avoid any suggestion of double counting in those matters [which in context must mean the offences in counts 3-4] alongside what I have described as the core and most serious offence of the specially aggravated kidnapping. (my emphasis)


	
	The statement that has given rise to the present two grounds of appeal, made after consideration of the objective seriousness of the offending and the subjective circumstances of the offenders, was at p 34 of the remarks on sentence, where his Honour was clearly referring only to the offence the subject of count 5 and said:
	


It is the case that the detention in this instance was not for the advantage of obtaining money, but that is a distinction of limited comfort in light of the humiliation and fear occasioned throughout the period of detention. That period of detention was hours rather than days, however, they were hours of continuing terror, humiliation and threat, including with lethal weapons, being a knife in particular. I also do not overlook the imposing size and appearance of the two offenders, acting in concert and speaking in terms that were plainly calculated to instil terror in a victim who had already been bashed and who I find feared for her life.

I note that the victim was only relieved of her ordeal by her own quick thinking and the fortuitous presence nearby of alert police officers. I find that the detention came about as an act of quasi-vigilantism on the part of the offenders. I regard that as an aggravating circumstance. The offence is also one where the protection of the community from violent tendencies in each of these offenders is a matter requiring reflection in sentences that will meet the purposes of sentencing in a penalty that includes appropriate attention to specific deterrence of both offenders. (my emphasis)


	
	For Mr Sorensen it is submitted, in effect, that it was an error of principle for his Honour to treat quasi-vigilantism as an aggravating feature and that what authorities such as Speechley and Barlow v R [2008] NSWCCA 96; (2008) 184 A Crim R 187 contemplate is that, depending on the circumstances of the case, quasi-vigilantism may not be a mitigating feature but that they do not go further to say that it is or can be an aggravating feature. It is submitted that retribution or vigilantism provides an explanation for the conduct but cannot make it more serious than an offence committed, say, for financial gain or sexual gratification.
	
	
	That submission cannot be accepted. In Speechley (at [110]), Johnson J expressly recognised the need to condemn actions of a vigilante nature and the relevance of this to reflecting general deterrence on sentence. The passages in Barlow (at [40] and [67]-[68]) referred to at [112] and [113] in Speechley make clear that not only may quasi-vigilantism mitigate to some degree the objective seriousness of an offence in particular cases but also it may indicate in particular cases the need for a more severe sentence to address issues of deterrence.
	
	
	Therefore, subject to the qualification that must be made having regard to the issue raised by ground 2A of the grounds raised in relation to the sentence, it cannot be said that it was not open to his Honour to take into account the quasi-vigilante nature of the offending when assessing both the objective seriousness of the offending and the need for the sentence to reflect issues of deterrence in that regard.
	
	
	The alternative and narrower submission put for Mr Sorensen on ground 2 is that even if as a matter of principle quasi-vigilantism could be considered an aggravating factor, it should not be regarded as one in the circumstances of this case on the basis that here there was provocation in the form of the theft of the rings from Ms Turner’s house. Acceptance of that proposition would logically mean that quasi-vigilantism would presumably never be an aggravating factor, since it is predicated on there being some wrong or perceived wrong that provides an explanation for the conduct, but in any event it was a matter for his Honour to evaluate the weight to be placed on this factor when assessing the objective seriousness of the conduct.
	
	
	It was open for example to his Honour to regard, as an aggravating factor for counts 2-4, the offenders’ violent and disproportionate reaction to the theft, or alleged theft, of three diamond rings (relatively trivial in the sense that, however valuable the three rings may have been – and there was no evidence as to this – the attempted theft was thwarted within a very short time and the rings recovered and returned to Ms Turner).
	
	
	Whether that operated wholly to attenuate any mitigating effect that the quasi-vigilantism might otherwise have had (which is how the Crown submits his Honour’s remarks should be read) or to warrant an increase in the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate absent the quasi-vigilantism, is not necessary to address.
	
	
	Ground 2 must therefore be rejected.
	
	
	Ground 2A, however, raises a different issue.
	
	
	Section 21A(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides that the Court is not to have regard to any aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any act or rule of law to do so. In R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280; (2005) 155 A Crim R 499, Rothman J said at [40]:
	


Even though a matter may be described as an aggravating factor, if it forms part of the elements of an offence or cannot, as a matter of law, be taken into account, then, notwithstanding the generality of description in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, such a matter cannot be an aggravating factor in the determination of the sentence for the offence in question.


	
	In R v Kelly, where the offence was of aggravated robbery contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act, Rothman J held that the sentencing judge had erred in taking into account the actual and threatened use of violence as an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence to be applied, since use of violence was an integral element in the offence. His Honour said that any regard, even minor, to the use of violence as an aggravating factor on sentence would in those circumstances be an error ([42]).
	
	
	In Hanze v R [2006] NSWCCA 36, Giles JA said (at [26]):
	


The limitation in regard to an aggravating factor is not to be applied mechanically, but to give effect to the common law preclusion of double counting by increasing the offender’s punishment because of something already taken into account by virtue of the conviction (after trial or on a plea of guilty).


	
	In the present case, Mr Sorensen submits that the quasi-vigilante nature of the offence was embraced in the charge under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act, namely that the advantage sought was to obtain gratification by punishing and humiliating Ms L, and hence this should not have been taken into account as an aggravating factor in sentencing for that offence.
	
	
	The Crown does not dispute that the advantage pleaded in count 5 of the indictment and the quasi-vigilante conduct referred to by the sentencing judge were the same conduct. However, the Crown submits that his Honour did not double count the quasi-vigilantism or otherwise err in the instinctive synthesis of the sentence in this regard.
	
	
	The Crown submits in effect that what his Honour should be understood as having meant, when stating that he regarded the quasi-vigilantism as an aggravating circumstance, was that the conduct “required the imposition of a sentence that properly reflected that the quasi vigilantism had been taken into account once and had resulted in the full weight being afforded to specific general deterrence, denunciation and community protection on account of the motive”.
	
	
	The Crown points to his Honour’s recognition of the need to avoid double counting in the sentencing process (in the passages to which I have already referred).
	
	
	The Crown submits that, having regard to the earlier references as to the need to avoid double counting, his Honour’s observation in relation to count 5 that vigilantism was an aggravating circumstance was a “short hand reprise” of his Honour’s earlier considerations of the factors identified in Speechley (at [110]) and was a reference to the possibility that vigilantism might warrant less weight to be afforded to special deterrence and/or community protection in cases of the type to which reference was made in the extracts from R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 per Spigelman CJ at [33] and R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 94 per Howie J at [30]-[32].
	
	
	In other words, what seems to be suggested is that his Honour’s statement may be read as a rejection of the possibility that the quasi-vigilantism in the present case might operate to ameliorate the sentence to be imposed on count 5, as a consequence of the reduced need for weight to be afforded to specific deterrence and/or community protection in the instinctive synthesis of the sentence; and, conversely, a recognition that full weight should be accorded to the need for a sentence reflecting the requirements of specific and general deterrence and community protection in the present case where the offence was very serious, the alleged motivation relatively trivial and the offender had a criminal history of offending which included an offence having a strong similarity to the present matter.
	
	
	The Crown argues that the present circumstances required the vigilantism to be counted once in the determination of the additional weight to be afforded to specific deterrence, general deterrence, denunciation and community protection and that this is what occurred.
	
	
	However, having properly recognised the need to avoid double counting the aggravating factor of the quasi-vigilantism in relation to the other offences when considering the totality of the offending (that being overshadowed by the specially aggravated kidnapping) (see [105], [108] above), his Honour nevertheless expressly referred to quasi-vigilantism as an aggravating factor for the count 5 offence, when the aggravation itself formed part of the charge. Punishment and humiliation were necessary parts of the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping as pleaded on the indictment. It could not properly be regarded as an aggravating factor on sentencing for an offence of which it formed part.
	
	
	Therefore, even though the extent to which and the manner in which that factor was taken into account in determining the sentence for count 5 is not clear, I am of the opinion that his Honour erred in finding that the quasi-vigilante nature of the count 5 offence was an aggravating factor. Ground 2A is made out. In those circumstances it falls to this Court to re-sentence Mr Sorensen in line with the principles in Kentwell v The Queen [2014] HCA 37; (2014) 252 CLR 601.
	


Ground 3


	
	Given that the sentencing discretion is to be exercised by this Court afresh, it is not necessary for the Court to consider ground 3. Whether the sentence is manifestly excessive is not an issue which this Court is now required to determine.
	


Re-sentencing


	
	As to the objective seriousness of the various offences, I deal first with the sexual assault offence (count 3). It did not involve sexual gratification but it was degrading and humiliating. Ms L was made to strip and to crawl around like a dog, with derogatory comments being made as to her physical appearance. The touching of Ms L’s breast and stomach was described as “grabbing” and was not prolonged. Although Mr Sorensen has pointed out the conduct followed some mild consensual sexual activity between Ms L and Mr Hall earlier that evening, I do not consider that this minimises the seriousness of later non-consensual sexual activity.
	
	
	Turning then to the offences of violence (counts 2, 4 and 5), while the physical injuries suffered were relatively minor, with minor bruising and swelling but no laceration or breaking of the skin or fractures, the medical evidence was consistent with heat being applied in some fashion to Ms L’s naked back and her back was stomped on with sufficient force to leave shoe prints on her back. The offences were accompanied by threats of serious violence, including the implicit threat comprised by Mr Sorensen’s statement that if it had been him she would have had her head cut off and she would not be leaving the house unless she was in bubble wrap or a body bag. Ms L was terrorised by the presence and utilisation of the hammer and aerosol (though not to the extreme degree of which she gave evidence) and it may readily be accepted that she suffered psychological trauma during the offending. The description of Ms L on the CCTV was of someone in a state of extreme distress.
	
	
	Even allowing for the degree of undoubted exaggeration by Ms L, she was subjected to both actual and threatened violence of a serious kind.
	
	
	In relation to counts 2 and 4, where it is not inappropriate to take into account the quasi-vigilante nature of the offences, the conduct represented an excessively disproportionate response to a relatively trivial perceived wrong. In those circumstances there is no cause to ameliorate the sentence that might otherwise be appropriate to impose. Rather this factor points to a need for the sentences to reflect both specific deterrence and community protection.
	
	
	As to count 5, the detention was for a period of some hours. Ms L was subjected to a degrading and distressing course of actual and threatened violence, albeit not to the extent that she recalled having been perpetrated. The threats made against her were very serious, as was the stomping on her back by Mr Hall. Ms L feared for her life.
	
	
	In written submissions for Mr Sorensen reference was made to Ms L having willingly and voluntarily placed herself in a vulnerable situation, including by reason of her having driven from Wollongong to Penrith to an unfamiliar area without a driver’s licence and with no money. Although such a submission amounts on its face to a concession of vulnerability, the Crown accepts that there was no finding of vulnerability such as to be taken into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In my opinion the circumstances in which Ms L came to be at Mr Sorensen’s house neither lessen nor heighten the objective seriousness of what was done to her there.
	
	
	Mr Sorensen also notes that one of the mitigating factors to be taken into account when imposing sentence pursuant to s 21A(3)(c) of the Act is provocation by the victim. Reference is made in this regard to Ms L’s involvement in the theft or alleged theft of Ms Turner’s jewellery. However, even apart from the absence of a finding as to Ms L’s involvement in the theft of the jewellery, as already noted it can only be said that this was an extravagantly disproportionate response to a relatively minor perceived wrong.
	
	
	Insofar as Mr Sorensen sought to draw a comparison (favourable to his position) between the present case and the offending that was considered in Morrison v R [2014] NSWCCA 199, this Court has previously observed that there is a danger in seeking to draw factual comparisons between cases for the simple reason that the facts of the cases necessarily differ. It is necessary to bear in mind the totality of the circumstances which have resulted in a particular sentence being imposed in a particular case (see RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 per Bellew J at [132], McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing).
	
	
	Having regard to the totality of the offending comprised by counts 2, 4 and 5, I would place those offences as being of a high order of objective seriousness. In relation to counts 2 and 4 (as noted above) while I would not impose a greater sentence by reference to the quasi-vigilante nature of the offences neither do I consider that this warrants any amelioration of the sentence that I would otherwise impose.
	
	
	As to subjective matters, the pre-sentence report dated 5 December 2013 disclosed a history of an unstable upbringing as well as a lengthy history of criminal conduct. Mr Sorensen accepts that he has spent over half his life in custody. Significantly, at the time of the offence he was on parole for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist whose report was tendered on Mr Sorensen’s behalf at the sentencing hearing, concluded that Mr Sorensen had exhibited signs indicating he was suffering from major depression and was in remission from a poly-substance abuse disorder. His criminal history included a series of offences committed after having consumed illicit substances. It is apparent from the evidence that he is, as his Honour described him, a seasoned criminal and seasoned drug abuser.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro recommended cognitive behavioural therapy to address and develop relapse prevention strategies in a number of areas in effect to provide Mr Sorensen with the basic skills for living in society as a normal citizen. Mr Watson-Munro also noted Mr Sorensen’s commitment to his partner and to his partner’s infant daughter.
	
	
	Mr Sorensen had, as referred to earlier, provided a letter to the sentencing judge asserting his determination to cease using drugs and to use the motivation of a potential for a normal family life to strengthen his resolve to avoid further offending. There was, however, no expression of remorse for the suffering meted out to Ms L nor did Mr Sorensen accept his guilt. Mr Sorensen’s prior record and poor prospects of rehabilitation require a sentence that focusses on specific deterrence and community protection.
	
	
	The sentencing judge considered that Mr Sorensen had a “glimmer of insight in him that he had wasted far too much of his life in custody as he now approached middle age, with looming powerful indications that he has become institutionalised” and thus he should be subjected to a longer period on parole “which, if productive, will be for the good of the community” and accordingly found special circumstances that justified a variation of the statutory formula in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am sceptical that such special circumstances are present, there being little, if any evidence to justify a finding that there are significant positive signs which show that if Mr Sorensen is given a longer period on parole rehabilitation is likely to be successful, as opposed to being a mere possibility (R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40; (2014) 239 A Crim R 399 at [56]-[57]). However, the Crown did not in this Court submit that his Honour erred in this regard or that, in resentencing, no such finding should be made. In the circumstances I have slightly reduced the non-parole period from that which would follow from applying the s 44 formula.
	
	
	Taking into account those matters, the respective maximum penalties and, as to count 3, the standard non-parole period, as well as the principle of totality, and applying, as the primary judge did, a high degree of concurrency, I propose the following indicative sentences:
	



	
	on count 2, 3 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	on count 3, 3 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, 3 months;
	
	
	on count 4, 2 years’ imprisonment;
	
	
	on count 5, 8 years’ imprisonment,
	


aggregated to an overall sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment commencing on 24 May 2013 with a non-parole period of 7 years expiring on 23 May 2020.

Orders


	
	The orders I propose are as follows:
	



	
	Grant an extension of time until 31 July 2015 to file the notice of appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Appeal against conviction dismissed.
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal against sentence.
	
	
	Appeal against sentence allowed.
	
	
	Sentences imposed by the primary judge are quashed.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, Michael Christian Sorensen is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10 years commencing on 24 May 2013 and expiring on 23 May 2023, with a non-parole period of 7 years to expire on 23 May 2020.
	
	
	The earliest date on which Mr Sorensen will be eligible for release on parole is 24 May 2020.
	



	
	ADAMS J: I agree with Ward JA.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Ward JA.

		14 April 2016",2016-04-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701770,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 45) [2016] NSWSC 452,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	On 13 April 2016 in the absence of the jury, counsel for McNamara, Mr Wendler, indicated to the Court that he anticipated that some of the evidence he would seek to lead from McNamara when his case commenced would meet with an objection by counsel for Rogerson. The transcript of the proceedings on that day will reflect the discussion that followed as to how that issue ought be appropriately dealt with. At one stage it was suggested by Mr Wendler that the matter could be dealt with on the voir dire, with McNamara giving the evidence which it was anticipated would meet with an objection. For the reasons expressed at the time I came to the view that the preferable approach was to deal with the matter as and when the evidence was about to be given. I pointed out, amongst other things, that if that course were taken it would give me the opportunity of placing the evidence in its proper context.
	
	
	On the following day, 14 April 2016 (which was the 49th day of the present trial) the Crown case closed. The case for the accused McNamara commenced with the accused being called. Early in the course of his evidence counsel took McNamara directly to the events of 20 May 2014. It was at that point that the present issue arose. Before coming to the issue itself, it is necessary for me to set out the context in which it arises. I do so firstly by reference to the terms in which McNamara's case was opened on 2 February 2016 by Ms Shead (who then appeared for him). Ms Shead said (commencing at T72 L34):
	


The Crown relies upon the events after the shooting to demonstrate a joint criminal enterprise between Mr McNamara and Roger Rogerson. After shooting Mr Gao though Rogerson immediately threatened and made multiple threats to harm Mr McNamara and his family. These threats continued. Given the content of the threats and Mr McNamara's state of mind, he genuinely feared for his safety and that of his family.

For this and other reasons he went along with the disposal of Mr Gao's body, he used his boat to do so, he was acting under duress in the same way the dealings he had with the drugs that were in the car were done under duress. They were done with the belief that he would be killed by Roger Rogerson or more particularly his daughters would be killed. He had seen Roger Rogerson shoot and kill Jamie Gao in front of his eyes and he was terrified.

Mr McNamara did not want to contact the police directly. He was fearful that Rogerson would find out about him contacting the police and he and his daughters would thereby be placed in jeopardy but he did keep some evidence and the police found it, they found it and it had Roger Rogerson's fingerprints on it in terms of a receipt. He did a number of things in an endeavour to lead police to evidence of what had occurred. Mr McNamara at that point, from the point in time of the shooting, was in fear for his own life and the life of his family members. What he did, he did under duress.

Mr McNamara, members of the jury, will give evidence and he will tell you what happened to him and what he saw Roger Rogerson do when he shot Jamie Gao twice and killed him in the storage shed. We ask you to listen very carefully to the entirety of the evidence and most importantly to keep an open mind until you have heard all of the evidence.”


	
	It will be apparent from my discussion below that the evidence which now is sought to be led from McNamara, and to which objection is taken, extends beyond the matters to which Ms Shead referred. That said, the absence of any reference to the evidence in the opening address is perfectly understandable. Clearly, Ms Shead anticipated (correctly, as it turns out) that the evidence would meet with an objection and she did not want to risk the jury being discharged by opening on it.
	
	
	Subsequently, on 26 February Ms Shead said (commencing at T1296 L3):
	


Can I say that in any number of written submissions since I came into this matter it has been made clear that Mr McNamara relies upon duress both in relation to the murder charge and the drug charge. In this way, for the murder charge, the Crown relies upon joint criminal enterprise. It will inevitably invite the jury to consider all of the events relating to the murder up until and including the disposal of Mr Gao's body.

Mr McNamara's case was from the time Mr Rogerson shot Mr Gao up until whatever event it is that the Crown concludes the joint criminal enterprise with, that duress is operating on him for that portion of the joint criminal enterprise.


	
	When I inquired as to whether or not duress was said to operate on McNamara from the time at which the deceased was shot Ms Shead responded (commencing at T1296 L16):
	


From the time of the shooting and the first threat, correct. So where the Crown says to the jury, ""You will be satisfied there was a joint criminal enterprise to kill, it was preplanned, you can look at the behaviour before and the behaviour after"", we will invite the jury to conclude they cannot assess the behaviour after in the same way because duress was operating upon Mr McNamara. In that way duress is relevant to the jury's consideration of the allegation of murder.

I have articulated that much more clearly and with much greater precision in earlier written submissions on a number of occasions, your Honour. In terms of Mr Thomas' query through your Honour about Ms McNamara's cross‑examination, unless your Honour directs me to indicate what it is I propose to do with Ms McNamara, then it is a matter for objection as and when questions are asked.


	
	Mr Wendler, who how appears for Mr McNamara, has confirmed that McNamara’s case remains as was put by Ms Shead.
	
	
	It is against that background that I come to deal with the evidence which is now sought to be led from McNamara and to which objection has been taken. The evidence falls into two parts.
	
	
	Firstly, in the course of giving evidence yesterday, McNamara gave an account of what is said to have occurred in the storage shed at Rent-a-space on 20 May 2014. A central aspect of that account is an assertion that the co-accused Rogerson fired two shots into the body of the deceased which killed him. According to Mr McNamara, when that occurred he was under a table in the storage unit. Following the second shot he said to the accused Rogerson:
	


""Why? Why? Why?""


	
	Counsel for McNamara now seeks to lead evidence from McNamara to the following effect (as outlined commencing at T3044 L8):
	


“I expect the evidence that is about to be introduced by the witness after he used the words, ""Why? Why?"" He will then give evidence that he alleges that Rogerson then turned and approached him pointing the gun directly at his head and said the words ""I did Drury"" a reference to a person called Michael Drury, a former police officer, ""I did Drury, I'll do you too. Get up and fucking help me you weak cunt or I'll leave you on the floor lying next to him"". I expect the evidence will be then that Rogerson's rejoinder was, ""He pulled the fucking knife first, get up and help me or you'll be as dead as him, then I'll kill your girls"" following which, as a result of those threats and indeed coupled with what the accused knew of the background circumstances of Mr Rogerson, in particular of what he had revealed to him in conversation at a time in or about February at Rogerson's home, a conversation which—“


	
	Mr Thomas, who appears for Rogerson, accepted that the evidence that Rogerson pointed the gun directly at McNamara’s head, and the entirety of the evidence on and from the words ""Get up and fucking help me"", were matters to which he could not properly object. However, he (and ultimately the Crown) objected to the reference within that passage to the circumstances surrounding a Mr Drury, a former police officer who was the subject of an attempted murder some years ago, in respect of which Rogerson was charged and found not guilty.
	
	
	The second part of the evidence to which objection will be taken emerged during the course of argument, when it became apparent that there was further evidence of a not dissimilar kind which McNamara sought to give and which was said to go to the same issue. In this regard Mr Wendler seeks to lead evidence from McNamara that in February of 2014, about three months prior to the deceased's murder, he had a conversation with Rogerson. That conversation is said to have occurred in the context of McNamara having agreed, tentatively or otherwise, to write a book concerning Rogerson's life, and his career as a police officer. There is evidence already before the jury that Mr McNamara is an author, having previously had two books published. There was apparently some understanding reached that if McNamara ultimately did write a book about Rogerson he would not finalise or publish it until such time as Rogerson had died.
	
	
	The evidence of the conversation which Mr Wendler will seek to lead was outlined commencing at T3052 L13. Obviously that outline was based upon Mr Wendler's instructions and represents his expectation of what the evidence will be. Because of the lengthy submissions that I have heard in relation to this issue, it is appropriate that I set out that outline in full:
	


Rogerson said to the accused, ""When I was charged with conspiracy to murder Drury, that cunt, Clive Small, got Alan Williams to give me up. Williams only did three years for pleading guilty to conspiracy with Flannery and me to murder Drury. Williams is dead now. It looked like suicide but it wasn't. I never let anyone get away with giving me up. I couldn't let Williams get away with that, the cunt of a thing"".

The rejoinder from Mr McNamara was, ""You arranged his murder?"" Response from Rogerson, ""Yeah, I'm connected everywhere. He thought he was living the quiet life after getting out of gaol; not so"".

It went on as follows:

Mr McNamara said, ""Flannery was never a witness in the Drury trial, what happened to him?"" It is alleged that Mr Rogerson said, ""He was real close to Alan Williams, both Melbourne blokes. As soon as I heard that fucking Small was working on Williams to rollover, I couldn't leave it to chance that Chris wouldn't roll as well. He was a coke fiend. He wasn't as tough as everyone thought. It was the coke. Kath, his missus, used to dose him up before he went out and did a job to hype him up. He was with me when I done Drury, off his head on coke, the useless cunt. If the two of them had been against me I would have been fucked"".

Mr McNamara then said, ""What happened?"" The reply was in these terms, ""Chris had the twitches from too much coke so I shot Drury. Chris was just a useless drug addict"".

Mr McNamara then said, ""Why did you even go with Flannery to Drury's house?"" Mr Rogerson said, ""We alibied each other"". Mr McNamara asked the question, ""But why were you even involved?"" Rogerson's response was, ""Drury was a smart arse, stumbled across Williams who was a big time crook and he was stupid, he knocked back 25 grand, a lot of money in those days. Williams was desperate. He offered 100,000 to get rid of Drury"".

Mr McNamara asked the question, ""So where is Flannery?"" Rogerson said, ""Chris had run out of mates in Sydney, he's killed most of them. He had to go. I was his only friend. It was easy. I met with him and put two in his chest, then we put him on a boat, went out three miles off Sydney Heads, mate, he's never coming back. Chris would have rolled on me for sure if Small had of got to him"".

The conversation moved to the circumstances of Mr Lanfranchi. Mr McNamara asked, ""What happened with Lanfranchi?"" He replied, ""I shot Lanfranchi twice, once in the neck and then one in the chest. That was close. The jury said I didn't act in self‑defence. Those fucking lefties at the Herald and the ABC gave me fucking heaps but I got through it"".

Mr McNamara said, ""Why did you shoot Lanfranchi for a second time?"" And Mr Rogerson said, ""He had to die, he ripped off Ned's gear which was my gear. Only one thing for a bloke like that. He was wanted for attempted murder of a police motorcyclist so it was easy to justify"".

Mr McNamara said, ""What happened to Huckstepp?"" Mr Rogerson said, ""Fuck me, she had to go. Even after I sued Channel Nine she was still into me, the fucking junkie bitch. It was a problem for Ned as well, one we solved. You know she drowned in a shallow pond"".

Mr McNamara said, ""Yes, but why?"" And it is alleged that the response was, ""After I knocked Lanfranchi she never let it go."" ""Why not just ignore her?"" Rogerson said, ""No‑one puts shit on me, I always win"".

There was further conversation where Mr Rogerson said to Mr McNamara, ""Fucking drug dealers won't pay if you don't stand on them"". And Mr McNamara said, ""What do you mean?"" Mr Rogerson said, ""Ever heard of a bloke Luton Chu?"" Mr McNamara said, ""No"". Mr Rogerson said, ""Heroin dealer, up and down between Australia and Hong Kong. Thought he could outsmart his suppliers. I helped my Chinese friends fix him up for good as well"".

Mr McNamara said, ""When did that happen?"" ""A while ago, cops thought about Ned for it, no‑one was ever charged"".


	
	Mr Wendler submitted that the evidence of that conversation, along with the evidence of what was said by Rogerson in the storage unit in reference to Mr Drury, provided relevant background to McNamara’s case. In particular, Mr Wendler submitted that the conversation in February of 2014 provided relevant background to what had later been said by Rogerson, and what took place, in the storage unit on 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Mr Wendler submitted McNamara had formed a belief that what Rogerson had told him in February 2014 was in fact true. He explained that it will be McNamara's case that those matters weighed on his mind when Rogerson threatened him in the storage unit, and when he repeated those threats at a later time. In the latter respect, evidence has already been given by McNamara’s daughter about statements said to have been made by Rogerson late on 20 May which, it will be submitted to the jury, were threatening in nature. Mr Wendler explained that McNamara's case will be that everything that he did after the deceased was shot in the storage unit was done under duress, and that such duress stemmed from the threats which were made by Rogerson at that time and thereafter. He submitted that what McNamara had been told by Rogerson in the conversation of February 2014 contributed to the fear he held.
	
	
	Mr Wendler emphasised that he was not relying on what Rogerson had allegedly said in February 2014 as evidence of the truth. The same applied to his reliance on Rogerson’s references to the Mr Drury inside the storage unit. Mr Wendler explained that in each case he was seeking to lead the evidence purely as evidence of the fact that certain things were said, as evidence which provided a basis for McNamara's fear of Rogerson, and as evidence which went some way to providing an explanation of why McNamara acted as he did in the days following the deceased's murder.
	
	
	Importantly, Mr Wendler specifically disavowed any reliance on the evidence for some tendency or similar purpose. He accepted that if the evidence were admitted it would be necessary to direct the jury as to the limited use to which it could be put. Inherent in Mr Wendler's position was that any danger of any unfair prejudice to Rogerson which might be caused by the admission of the evidence could be appropriately and adequately addressed by a careful direction to the jury.
	
	
	The Crown's initial position was that the evidence was relevant, that it had some significant probative value, and that such probative value substantially outweighed the danger of any unfair prejudice to Rogerson. In making those submissions, the Crown argued that any danger of unfair prejudice, if it existed at all, could be properly dealt with by a direction to the jury in the terms that I have outlined. However, when the matter resumed this morning the Crown's position was the opposite of that which was initially put. In making that observation I do not intend any criticism of the Crown. Issues of this nature, which are not uncomplicated, often benefit from careful and measured reflection.
	
	
	The Crown's revised position, if I can put it that way, was that whilst the evidence had ""some” probative value, it added little to the issue of duress. The Crown described the evidence of the conversation in February 2014 as being in the nature of ""window dressing"". The Crown submitted that properly analysed, McNamara's case on duress was really centred upon the threats made by Rogerson immediately upon allegedly shooting the deceased, and not upon a conversation he had allegedly had with Rogerson many months before.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, by reference to s. 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”), that the probative value of the evidence (such as it was) was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. In advancing that submission, the Crown emphasised the words “danger” and “might” as they are used in s. 135. In doing so, the Crown submitted that it was not necessary, in order to exercise the discretion in s. 135 to exclude the evidence, to conclude that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the fact of unfair prejudice. He emphasised that the test was whether the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the exclusion of evidence would not deprive McNamara of the opportunity to rely on duress in the way in which had been outlined. Indeed, the Crown submitted that McNamara’s “real” case on duress stemmed from what, on his account, had occurred at the time of the shooting of the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Thomas, on behalf of Rogerson, strenuously opposed the admission of the evidence. Although he generally supported the submissions of the Crown, he did not limit his argument to those matters and advanced a number of further submissions which, he argued, should cause the evidence to be excluded under s. 135. Although in the course of submissions Mr Thomas indicated an intention to rely on paragraphs (b) and (c) of s. 135, it was apparent that the import of his submissions were directed to paragraph (a).
	
	
	Whilst Mr Thomas ultimately accepted that the evidence was relevant to the issue of duress, he submitted that the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson was ""overwhelming"", to the extent it was incapable of being rectified or addressed by any direction to the jury, however carefully crafted the terms of that direction might be. He went so far as to say that if the evidence was admitted it would be impossible for Rogerson to receive a fair trial. He too pointed out that even if the evidence was excluded, McNamara would still be in a position where he was able to agitate the issue of duress. In this regard, he described the evidence of the conversation in February 2014 as amounting to ""padding"", a not dissimilar categorisation of the evidence to that adopted by the Crown by his use of the term ""window dressing"".
	
	
	Mr Thomas submitted that there was an element of artificiality attaching to the purpose for which the evidence was said to be relied upon. He submitted that that such artificiality arose from the proposition that the evidence was sought to be led as evidence of the fact, in circumstances where McNamara would give evidence that he believed it to be true. Part of Mr Thomas' submission, as I understood it, was that any distinction between those two concepts would be likely to be lost upon the members of the jury. He submitted that in reality, what was being sought was to adduce evidence of propensity or tendency.
	
	
	Mr Thomas' focus then turned to the conduct of his own case in the event that the evidence was admitted. He submitted that there would be a need, as he put it, to ""meet"" the evidence in Rogerson’s case. He submitted that in so doing it would be necessary for Rogerson to demonstrate that the statements attributed to him were not said, and were not true.
	
	
	Mr Thomas further submitted that the admission of the evidence ran the grave risk of allowing the trial to effectively degenerate into something in the nature of a wide ranging inquiry as to whether or not Rogerson was responsible for the murder of a number of other persons. He submitted that admission of the evidence would give rise to a significant danger of Rogerson being exposed to cross-examination about the circumstances in which a number of other persons had died. Mr Thomas stressed what he submitted was the enormity of the prejudice which would arise were that allowed to occur.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Thomas submitted that in the event that the evidence was admitted he would seek that the jury be discharged. As I observed at the time, such application would only arise, obviously, in the event that the evidence were admitted. I indicated that occurred, I would give Mr Thomas and other counsel the opportunity to be heard.
	
	
	As I indicated in the course of the argument when it commenced yesterday afternoon, there are two basic issues. The first is whether or not the evidence is relevant. The second is whether or not it should be excluded under s. 135(a) of the Act.
	
	
	Both the Crown and Mr Thomas accepted that the evidence was relevant. In my view, having regard to the terms of s. 55 of the Act, the entirety of the evidence is relevant. I have already made observations in a number of judgments delivered in this trial thus far to the fact that the terms of s. 55 of the Act are wide. Moreover, relevance is to be assessed on the basis that the evidence will be accepted by a jury: IMM v R [2016] HCA 14 at [49] (per French CJ, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ). Duress will clearly be raised by McNamara in the way in which I have outlined it. In my view, the respective positions taken by the Crown and Mr Thomas as to relevance were entirely proper.
	
	
	The more difficult question, and that which has been the primary focus of the submissions of the parties, concerns whether or not the evidence ought be excluded under s. 135 of the Act, which is in the following terms:
	


135 General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b) be misleading or confusing, or

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.


	
	As I have already noted, although Mr Thomas made passing references to paragraphs (b) and (c), it was clear that his position (and that of the Crown) concentrated on paragraph (a).
	
	
	The term ""probative value"" is defined in the dictionary to the Act in the following terms:
	


""Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""


	
	Having regard to the terms of s. 135, I must firstly assess the probative value of the evidence. In my view, accepting that duress will be an issue, the probative value of the evidence is limited for a number of reasons.
	
	
	Firstly, although part of the evidence centres upon a conversation there is no precision as to the time at which the conversation took place, other than the fact that it was in February 2014.
	
	
	Secondly, accepting that the conversation did take place at about that time, that was some months prior to the events of 20 May 2014.
	
	
	Thirdly, although relevant to the issue of duress, the evidence adds very little to that issue. As the Crown and Mr Thomas pointed out, the real basis of the duress asserted by McNamara stems from a combination of seeing the deceased shot in cold blood, and the threat made by Rogerson immediately thereafter.
	
	
	Bearing in mind my conclusion that the probative value of the evidence is limited, I must then consider whether such probative value as the evidence might have is outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. It is important to bear in mind that in order to exercise the discretion to exclude the evidence I do not have to be satisfied that it will be unfairly prejudicial. I need only to be satisfied that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be so: Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 8) [2005] FCA 1348 at [16] per Sackville J. In considering that question I must be mindful of any danger that it might be misused by the jury in some unfair way: Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [91] and [98] per McHugh J.
	
	
	It has been made clear in the course of the argument that the evidence is not sought to be adduced for the purposes of proving the truth of what Rogerson is alleged to have said. Rather, the evidence is sought to be led as evidence of the fact that such things were said, and as evidence bearing upon McNamara's subjective belief that they were true. I am not able to accept Mr Thomas' submission that that approach is artificial. If the evidence is admitted, it will be admitted as evidence of the fact of things having been said by Rogerson. McNamara will give evidence that he believed those things to be true. The fact that he may have believed that such things were true does not necessarily mean that they were true. Objective truth of a statement on the one hand, and a person's subjective belief as to the truth of that statement on another, are two different things.
	
	
	However all of that said, there is a clear danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson. In my view the probative value of the evidence, such as it is, is substantially outweighed by that danger. I have come to that view for a number of reasons.
	
	
	It cannot be assumed that this evidence, if admitted, will be the only evidence dealing with these matters. Obviously, McNamara will be cross-examined about it. Equally obviously, Rogerson will deny the statements attributed to him. He will be cross-examined about that denial. One does not have to pause for any length of time to reflect upon, and appreciate, the significance that such evidence would assume if it were admitted.
	
	
	In those circumstances there is, in my view, a real danger that if the evidence were admitted the jury would be left with a distinct impression that the accused Rogerson was complicit in the murder of a number of other people. Rogerson is obviously not on trial for the murder of any person other than the deceased. The circumstances in which other people may have been murdered are not matters about which the jury will be asked to return a verdict. Viewed in that way, and as a result of a combination of the circumstances to which I have referred, any probative value that the evidence might have is substantially outweighed by the danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial to Rogerson.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion I am conscious of those authorities which recognise the fact that a jury can be expected to follow any direction given by a trial judge: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 34) [2016] NSWSC 259 at [45]-[49]. Equally however, those authorities do not go so far as to say that a trial judge’s directions are capable of dealing with every instance where there is danger of unfair prejudice. There arise, from time to time, circumstances where the danger of unfair prejudice is so great that it cannot be cured by a direction, no matter what its terms. The present is such a case.
	
	
	In those circumstances, and for those reasons, I propose to exclude the evidence of the conversation of February 2014. For the same reasons I exclude the reference to Mr Drury which is said to have been made by Rogerson in the storage unit.
	
	
	It follows from what I have said that the remaining portions of the evidence outlined by Mr Wendler commencing at T3044 L8 will be admitted. To remove any doubt, that evidence (on the assumption that it is adduced in the terms foreshadowed) will be that Rogerson turned to McNamara, pointed a gun directly at his head, and said:
	


""Get up and fucking help me, you weak cunt, or I'll leave you on the floor lying next to him. He pulled the fucking knife first. Get up and help me or you'll be as dead as him, then I'll kill your girls"".


	
	Until further order of the Court, and pursuant to the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), this judgment is suppressed, save for any disclosure made by or to the parties and their legal representatives for the purposes of the proceedings, as well as to the trial judge in the proceedings of R v Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi, Mohomed Zarshay and Mohammad Kalal on the understanding that all copies of that judgment will be returned to the trial judge in those proceedings at the conclusion of any legal argument. .

2701771,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 46) [2016] NSWSC 454,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	Earlier today I received a note from the foreperson of the jury (MFI 168) in the following terms:
	


“Could the jury please request daily transcripts while the accused Glen McNamara is in the witness stand.”


	
	I have had the opportunity of discussing that request with counsel. The Crown, generally speaking supported the request being met.
	
	
	Mr Wendler and Mr Thomas, counsel for McNamara and Rogerson respectively, opposed it. The basis of that opposition essentially was that provision of the transcript to the members of the jury at this stage may have the capacity to cause them to be less attentive to the evidence as it is being given, in the knowledge that they would have the transcript anyway.
	
	
	The Crown, whilst maintaining his support for the request, appeared to acknowledge the force of the position put on behalf of each of the accused.
	
	
	Section 55C of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) confers a discretion on the Court to provide a copy of all, or part, of the trial transcript. If I conclude that it is appropriate to do so, I am provide other transcript as well: R v Lowe (1997) 98 A Crim R 300. As far as the latter issue is concerned, it seems to me that if the transcript of McNamara’s evidence were to be provided, the position would have to be the same in the case of a transcript of any evidence given by Rogerson.
	
	
	In my view, there is some force in the submissions made by Mr Wendler and Mr Thomas as to the propensity for the jury to be distracted in the event that the transcript was provided at this stage.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to tell the jury that in accordance with my general practice the transcript will not be provided at this stage, but that when their deliberations commence they will be at liberty to request provision of such part(s) of the transcript as they wish and that, all things being equal, any such request(s) will be met at that time.

		15 June 2016",2016-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701773,R v Turnbull (No. 6) [2016] NSWSC 706,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The trial of the Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, is to commence before a jury next Monday, 18 April 2016. It will proceed for some weeks.
	
	
	The Accused is 81 years old. There are a number of health issues which affect the Accused, understandably, because of the circumstances in which he finds himself and given his age. The Accused is presently detained in the Long Bay Hospital Wing. I would expect that he will remain there for the duration of a trial.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused has informed the Court that the timetable which has applied for the purpose of bringing the Accused to Court, and then back to Long Bay, is a lengthy and onerous one. He is woken at 4.00 am for the purpose of being transported with other persons to various courts by 10.00 am. There is no complaint about that aspect, which may be unavoidable.
	
	
	The difficulty lies at the end of the day, when present experience in the course of the pretrial hearing has been that the Accused is taken from Court after 4.00 pm, with the Corrective Services transport taking him via the Downing Centre and then Silverwater, ending up at the Long Bay Hospital Wing at about 10.00 pm. At that time he is provided with a meal.
	
	
	The Court is well aware of the demands on the Correctional authorities with respect to the management of Correctional Centres and transport of persons between Correctional Centres and Courts.
	
	
	However, the primary concerns which I have are not only that the Accused is in a fit state on the days that he comes to Court, but that if there be any problem with respect to his health, this could impact adversely upon the administration of justice in the conduct of the trial. This is to be trial by jury. I want to minimise the prospect of there being any interruption of a jury trial because of practical matters, of which this is an example.
	
	
	The present Accused is in a very unusual category. He is of an age that is highly uncommon for a person who is to stand trial for serious offences in this Court. It may be that factors of that sort are contributing to him being housed at the Long Bay Hospital Wing rather than in the general run of a Correctional Centre.
	
	
	It is my strong recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that steps be taken to transport the Accused to and from Court each day by the most expeditious means possible. If this means a special transport arrangement because of his age and circumstances then that, in my view, would be highly desirable.
	
	
	I understand, as I have said, that there are many demands on the Correctional authorities. However, a process of bringing the Accused to and from the Court each day so that the trial can proceed without interruption, and with the Accused being in the best state of health possible, are very important matters.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make a strong recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that steps be taken to transport the Accused each sitting day from the Long Bay Hospital Wing to Court and back by the most expeditious process possible (preferably by way of separate escort).
	
	
	I will cause this judgment to be settled urgently. A copy of it will be provided to the parties. I will also direct that it be provided to the relevant Correctional authorities, and also to the persons administering the Long Bay Hospital Wing in which the Accused is being housed. It may be that those persons have a view on this aspect, as well, which will inform a conclusion with respect to it.

		14 June 2016",2016-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701774,R v Turnbull (No. 5) [2016] NSWSC 439,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Ian Robert Turnbull, is to stand trial in this Court upon an indictment containing two counts:
	



	
	That on 29 July 2014, at Moree in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Glendon Turner.
	
	
	That on 29 July 2014, at Moree in the State of New South Wales, he did, without consent, detain Robert Strange with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely, the killing of Glendon Turner.
	



	
	In a Defence Response filed on 2 March 2016 for the purpose of s.143 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the Accused indicated the nature of his proposed defences to the murder count as being:
	



	
	substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s.23A Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 arising from intimidation/harassment by the deceased of the Accused and his family amounting to a serious indictable offence pursuant to s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	



	
	On 2 March 2016, the Accused also gave notice of intention to adduce evidence of substantial impairment in accordance with s.151 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	On 15 March 2016, the Accused gave notice to the Crown of intention to adduce tendency evidence under s.97 Evidence Act 1995. Further particulars in support of the tendency notice were provided to the Crown on 4 April 2016. As will be seen, the Accused’s proposed reliance upon tendency evidence is intertwined with the foreshadowed partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	It is expected that a jury will be empanelled on 18 April 2016 for the trial of the Accused.
	


The Present Pretrial Hearing


	
	In advance of the trial, a number of pretrial issues were raised. After the Court had ruled upon issues arising with respect to subpoenas issued on behalf of the Accused, the Crown submitted that a pretrial hearing should proceed with respect to the Accused’s intended reliance upon extreme provocation and the tendency notice served by the Accused in connection with that issue.
	
	
	After hearing submissions, I ruled on 11 April 2016 that certain issues were appropriate for pretrial rulings: R v Turnbull (No. 4) [2016] NSWSC 705. I observe that the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 came into existence on 13 June 2014. The provision only applies to events occurring after that date. The present trial appears to be the first case in which the proper construction and application of s.23 falls for consideration.
	
	
	Further, as will be seen, the context in which extreme provocation is sought to be raised in this case is highly unusual. I formed the view that a combination of factors rendered this matter appropriate for a pretrial hearing for the purpose of ss.130 and 139 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s.192A Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The matters to be addressed in this judgment arising from the pretrial hearing are as follows:
	



	
	a ruling on a question of law that might arise at the trial, being the proper construction of s.23 Crimes Act 1900: s.139(3)(g) Criminal Procedure Act 1986;
	
	
	a ruling concerning the admissibility or use of tendency evidence proposed to be adduced by the Accused: s.139(3)(e); s.192A Evidence Act 1995;
	
	
	arising from the ruling concerning the proper construction of s.23, a ruling concerning the possible operation of s.23 in the context of this trial upon the Court’s present state of knowledge of the matter.
	



	
	At one point, the Crown submitted that the Court would be in a position to, in effect, make a final ruling that the partial defence of extreme provocation was not available to the Accused in the circumstances of this case. The Accused has elected not to place before the Court, at this pretrial hearing, the entirety of factual matters which may bear upon this topic. The Court has a considerable body of material provided by the Crown (and referred to by the Accused), to which reference will be made. I will proceed to consider known aspects of the case, including material which the Accused has put before the Court on the tendency issue, for the purpose of this judgment.
	
	
	I am conscious that caution must be exercised in taking a step in advance of the trial which would operate to reduce, or even remove, the basis upon which an accused person may seek to rely upon a partial defence such as extreme provocation: Lindsay v The Queen [2015] HCA 16; 255 CLR 272 at 284 [27]-[28]. I am satisfied, however, that in circumstances where a new statutory provocation provision is being considered for the first time, and where the context in which it is said to arise is most unusual, that the course which I am taking is both open to the Court and appropriate.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 23 Crimes Act 1900, as enacted in 2014, is in the following terms:
	


“23 Trial for murder - partial defence of extreme provocation

(1)    If, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act causing death was in response to extreme provocation and, but for this section and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury is to acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.

(2)    An act is done in response to extreme provocation if and only if:

(a)    the act of the accused that causes death was in response to conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused, and

(b)    the conduct of the deceased was a serious indictable offence, and

(c)    the conduct of the deceased caused the accused to lose self-control, and

(d)    the conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.

(3)    Conduct of the deceased does not constitute extreme provocation if:

(a)    the conduct was only a non-violent sexual advance to the accused, or

(b)    the accused incited the conduct in order to provide an excuse to use violence against the deceased.

(4)    Conduct of the deceased may constitute extreme provocation even if the conduct did not occur immediately before the act causing death.

(5)    For the purpose of determining whether an act causing death was in response to extreme provocation, evidence of self-induced intoxication of the accused (within the meaning of Part 11A) cannot be taken into account.

(6)    For the purpose of determining whether an act causing death was in response to extreme provocation, provocation is not negatived merely because the act causing death was done with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm.

(7)    If, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was in response to extreme provocation, the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act causing death was not in response to extreme provocation.

(8)    This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.

(9)    The substitution of this section by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 does not apply to the trial of a person for murder that was allegedly committed before the commencement of that Act.

(10)    In this section:

act includes an omission to act.”


	
	The serious indictable offence upon which the Accused seeks to rely, for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900, is the offence of stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm contrary to s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. Section 13 provides:
	


“13    Stalking or intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm

(1)    A person who stalks or intimidates another person with the intention of causing the other person to fear physical or mental harm is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years or 50 penalty units, or both.

(2)    For the purposes of this section, causing a person to fear physical or mental harm includes causing the person to fear physical or mental harm to another person with whom he or she has a domestic relationship.

(3)    For the purposes of this section, a person intends to cause fear of physical or mental harm if he or she knows that the conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person.

(4)    For the purposes of this section, the prosecution is not required to prove that the person alleged to have been stalked or intimidated actually feared physical or mental harm.

(5)    A person who attempts to commit an offence against subsection (1) is guilty of an offence against that subsection and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.”


	
	“Serious indictable offence” is defined in s.4 Crimes Act 1900 as being “an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of five years or more”. The term “indictable offence” is defined in s.3 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as “an offence (including a common law offence) that may be prosecuted on indictment”. An offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 is a Table 2 indictable offence to be dealt with summarily, unless the prosecutor elects to have the offence concerned dealt with on indictment: s.260(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986; Clause 2, Table 2, Schedule 1, Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	As a s.13 offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years, it reaches the minimum threshold and so constitutes a serious indictable offence.
	
	
	Sections 7 and 8 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 define the terms “intimidation” and “stalking”. Sections 7 and 8 provide:
	


“7    Meaning of ‘intimidation’

(1)    For the purposes of this Act, intimidation of a person means:

(a) conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of the person, or

(b) an approach made to the person by any means (including by telephone, telephone text messaging, e-mailing and other technologically assisted means) that causes the person to fear for his or her safety, or

(c) any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury to a person or to a person with whom he or she has a domestic relationship, or of violence or damage to any person or property.

(2)    For the purpose of determining whether a person’s conduct amounts to intimidation, a court may have regard to any pattern of violence (especially violence constituting a domestic violence offence) in the person’s behaviour.

8    Meaning of ‘stalking’

(1)    In this Act, stalking includes the following of a person about or the watching or frequenting of the vicinity of, or an approach to, a person’s place of residence, business or work or any place that a person frequents for the purposes of any social or leisure activity.

(2)    For the purpose of determining whether a person’s conduct amounts to stalking, a court may have regard to any pattern of violence (especially violence constituting a domestic violence offence) in the person’s behaviour.”

Factual Matters


	
	Before proceeding further, some factual background is required. What follows is drawn from the documents tendered by the Crown at this pretrial hearing, being the documents in Exhibit PTA and the revised Crown Case Statement (Exhibit PTB). The account of events on 29 July 2014 represents the Crown case as drawn from Exhibit PTB.
	
	
	The incident in question occurred in the late afternoon of 29 July 2014 on public land adjacent to Talga Lane, a public road in the Croppa Creek area of northern New South Wales, about 60 kilometres north of Moree.
	
	
	The Accused was 79 years old at the time of the incident. He is a farmer and land owner. The Accused had been prosecuted for illegal land clearing under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003, said to have occurred between November 2011 and January 2012. The Crown alleges that the Accused was deeply angered by the prosecution, which was a lengthy and expensive process, and that the Accused resented what he saw as interference with his farming operation.
	
	
	Mr Turner, the deceased, was 51 years old at the time of the incident. He was employed as a Compliance and Regulation Officer for the Office of Environment and Heritage, Department of Premier and Cabinet (“OEH”). His role involved investigating illegal land clearing and prosecuting individuals for breaches of s.12 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that Mr Turner had been involved in monitoring illegal clearing on the Accused’s property, and had prosecuted the Accused in the two years running up to the incident. It is alleged that the Accused resented the prosecution and that there was ongoing animosity on behalf of the Accused towards Mr Turner.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, in the course of an incident on 28 June 2012, the Accused threatened Mr Turner. As a result of this alleged threat by the Accused, Mr Turner had been instructed not to have further contact with him.
	
	
	On 13 December 2012, the OEH commenced a prosecution against the Accused in the Land and Environment Court for one offence under s.12 Native Vegetation Act 2003, in relation to the alleged unlawful clearing of native vegetation on the properties “Colorado” and “Strathdoon” said to have occurred between 1 November 2011 and 18 January 2012. On about 17 May 2013, the Accused pleaded guilty before the Land and Environment Court to this charge. Between 4 and 7 March 2014, a sentencing hearing took place in the Land and Environment Court, with judgment being reserved at the conclusion of that hearing.
	
	
	On 25 June 2014, OEH commenced prosecutions against the Accused and Cory Turnbull in the Land and Environment Court for the alleged unlawful clearing of native vegetation on “Strathdoon” between 18 January 2012 and 4 September 2012.
	
	
	On the afternoon of 29 July 2014, Mr Turner and a work colleague, Robert Strange, were performing duties in the Croppa Creek area. Mr Turner and Mr Strange were en route to a site unrelated to the Accused. As they travelled along Talga Lane, the Crown alleges that they noticed a number of fires burning, consisting of cleared trees, on a property owned by the Accused’s son, Grant Turnbull, though the Crown asserts that the Accused is believed to have had some financial interest in that property as well.
	
	
	At about 4.56 pm, the vehicle containing Mr Turner and Mr Strange passed another vehicle driven by Ivan Maas, an employee of the Accused. The Crown alleges that Mr Maas recognised Mr Turner, and soon after called a colleague, Scott Kennett, indicating that he had seen Mr Turner in that location.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that between 5.00 pm and 5.05 pm, Mr Kennett advised the Accused that Mr Turner and another person were in the area and indicated their location.
	
	
	Soon after 5.00 pm, Mr Turner and Mr Strange stopped on County Boundary Road to take some photographs and GPS way points. Shortly before 5.15 pm, Mr Turner and Mr Strange drove to a point about 500 metres from the scene of the subsequent shooting and stopped. Mr Strange took a number of photographs and the men returned to their vehicle.
	
	
	At about 5.22 pm, the Accused arrived at the scene in a Nissan Patrol vehicle. Based on the account of Mr Strange, the Crown alleges that Mr Turner and Mr Strange were looking onto the property when a vehicle pulled up behind them. Mr Strange saw the Accused standing near the vehicle about 10 metres away.
	
	
	The Accused raised a .22 calibre rifle and shot Mr Turner once in the neck. Mr Turner dropped to one knee and said “Ian, what are you doing?”. Mr Turner managed to stand up, but was shot a second time in the upper-left chest region. This gunshot wound caused extra-thoracic soft-tissue damage and did not enter the thoracic cavity. The Crown contends that this would have significantly incapacitated Mr Turner through muscular-skeletal damage to the upper left limb. Mr Turner stumbled towards his work vehicle to take cover from further gun fire.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused then said “You have ruined the Turnbulls, you have had planes flying over here taking photographs, continually harassing us and taking us to court”. Mr Strange then said “Sir, he is hurt and I need to get him help. Please let me take him and get some help”.
	
	
	The Accused replied, “Toss that camera and the only way he is going is in a body bag”. Mr Strange tossed the camera away and said, “Sir, enough is enough, put the gun down we are only doing our job, this is stupid let me get him some help”. The Accused replied, “He isn’t letting us do our job”.
	
	
	Mr Strange attempted to get closer to the Accused, but the Accused pointed the rifle at Mr Strange and said, “You back up or you’ll get one in the heart”. Mr Turner then said, “Come on Ian, this is ridiculous”. The Accused then said, “You are continually harassing us turning up here whenever you like trying to get us”.
	
	
	The Accused then walked around the vehicle attempting to get a clear shot at Mr Turner. Mr Strange instructed Mr Turner where to move to avoid the Accused. This continued over a period of some time. Handprints in blood were deposited along the length of the vehicle.
	
	
	At about 5.32 pm, Mr Strange attempted to discreetly call “000” on his mobile phone, but there was no reception. Mr Strange then said, “Put the gun down, put the gun down, there is no need for this you have hurt him, he has a young family and is only doing a job he is told to do. Please put the gun down and let me take him to a hospital. I am begging you”.
	
	
	The Accused replied, “I have a family too, he is only going in a body bag. I will kill him and that will stop him”. Mr Strange said, “That is silly, sir there is no need for this, I’m begging you let me get him some help”.
	
	
	Mr Strange again attempted to get closer to the Accused, but the Accused pointed the rifle directly at Mr Strange and the Accused said, “I said get back or I will shoot you too, you will just be back again and again and I’m putting an end to it”. Mr Turner then said, “I won’t be back I can assure you”.
	
	
	The Accused then said, “No, you won’t be back because you are going in a body bag”. As he did so, the Accused moved around the vehicle towards the front and Mr Turner moved to the rear of the vehicle and removed an emergency beacon which was activated at 5.43 pm.
	
	
	Mr Strange then said, “Sir, please this is not helping anyone, put the gun down and let us go”. Mr Strange again tried to get closer to the Accused, but again the Accused pointed the rifle at Mr Strange and said, “You will be shot if you don’t back up”.
	
	
	The Accused then walked towards the rear of the vehicle pointing the rifle towards Mr Turner. He then fired two shots through the canopy window, shattering the glass. One bullet hit Mr Turner in the chest area and penetrated his clothing, but did not penetrate his skin. It caused a minor abrasion and it seems likely the velocity of the projectile was greatly reduced by impact upon the glass. The second of those two shots did not hit Mr Turner.
	
	
	The Accused continued to point the rifle at Mr Turner and moved to the rear of the vehicle in an attempt to get a clear path to him. Mr Strange then said “Sir, I’m begging you, put the gun down and let me take him to hospital, you have hurt him and he needs some help”.
	
	
	By this stage, the Accused was at the rear of the vehicle and fired another shot in the direction of Mr Turner. Mr Turner attempted to run towards the tree line and the boundary to escape from the Accused, but the Accused shot him in the back and Mr Turner fell to the ground. That shot was fatal. It struck the left side of Mr Turner’s back causing the following injuries:
	



	
	communication of the head of the fifth left rib at the spinal column;
	
	
	an aortic laceration;
	
	
	left upper lobe of lung laceration;
	
	
	left haemothorax (four litres).
	



	
	The fatal shot was fired between approximately 5.45 pm and 5.55 pm.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused then said to Mr Strange “You can go now. I’ll be at home waiting for the police”. The Accused then got in his vehicle and left the scene.
	
	
	Mr Turner died before emergency services arrived at the scene.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that, on his way home, the Accused communicated with Mr Kennett over the two-way radio, saying to him “You there Scott? I’ve just shot Turner, I think he’s dead. I’m going home to wait for the police”.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that the Accused, in the course of a conversation that evening as to why he had shot Mr Turner, said “I had no choice, he was ruining my family and it was never going to end”.
	
	
	The Accused was arrested by police later that evening.
	
	
	Subsequent investigations revealed a Browning .22 pump-action rifle inside the rear tray of the Accused’s Nissan Patrol vehicle. That rifle was registered in the name of the Accused. A ballistics report subsequently matched to that rifle the shell cases found at the scene of the shooting.
	


Evidence of Contact Between the Accused and Mr Turner


	
	The preceding recital of events provides some basic information concerning the association between the Accused and Mr Turner. The Crown tendered, on this hearing, material which shed further light on any association between the two men and contact between them.
	
	
	A précis of notes in Mr Turner’s compliance notebooks records a number of telephone calls and visits by Mr Turner to the Accused between August 2011 and November 2012 (Exhibit PTA, Tab 4).
	
	
	A chronology of events is set out in the statement dated 22 March 2016 of Mr Terrence Bailey, the Chief Executive, OEH (Exhibit PTA, Tab 8). This chronology sets out inspections by Mr Turner, and other action said to have been taken by Mr Turner with respect to the Accused and his properties (or properties of his family members) between April 2011 and June 2014.
	
	
	Based upon a review of documents maintained by Mr Turner, Detective Senior Constable Timothy McCarthy states that there is no sign of any direct contact (by telephone, in person or via email or other written document) between Mr Turner and the Accused after 28 June 2012 (Exhibit PTA, Tab 9).
	
	
	In a statement dated 6 April 2016, Mr Arthur Snook of the OEH refers to enquiries and examinations undertaken by him. He states that he is unable to find any records that indicate contact between Mr Turner and the Accused after 28 June 2012. Mr Snook states that he was Mr Turner’s direct supervisor at the OEH between June 2013 and 29 July 2014 and that, during this time, he was not aware of any contact at all between Mr Turner and the Accused (Exhibit PTA, Tab 10).
	


Extreme Provocation in s.23 Crimes Act 1900


	
	Section 23 in its present form was inserted by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014. Counsel for both parties invited the Court to have regard to the second reading speech of the then Attorney General, Mr Hazzard, delivered in the Legislative Assembly on 8 May 2014.
	
	
	I am satisfied that a proper basis exists for considering the second reading speech: s.34 Interpretation Act 1987. This step will also assist the Court to understand the purpose or object underlying the new s.23: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	In the second reading speech, the Attorney General observed that the 2014 amendments constituted the Government’s response to the Legislative Council Select Committee on the Partial Defence of Provocation, which had “unanimously recommended retaining, but significantly restricting, the partial defence”.
	
	
	The Attorney General described s.23(2) as “setting out a four staged test”.
	
	
	With respect to s.23(2)(a), the Attorney General said:
	


“The first threshold is set out in proposed section 23 (2) (a), which requires that the act causing death was in response to conduct towards or affecting the accused.”


	
	The Attorney General then referred to s.23(2)(b):
	


“Proposed section 23 (2) (b) requires that the ‘conduct’ relied upon must amount to a serious indictable offence. A serious indictable offence is any offence which, when dealt with on indictment, carries a maximum penalty of five years or more imprisonment. The word ‘conduct’ is not otherwise defined. This threshold ensures that the jury must be satisfied there is a reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased was behaviour that the community and Parliament have already determined is so serious that it attracts a significant criminal penalty. This reflects the view that, in contemporary society, there is an expectation that people otherwise faced with offensive, insulting or upsetting conduct should not contemplate homicide or inflicting really serious injury.

The requirement that the behaviour of the deceased amount to a serious indictable offence will also ensure that members of the community who are lawfully going about their business do not inadvertently ‘provoke’ another person to form an intention to kill or seriously injure them. What this threshold also provides of course is that merely leaving a relationship or infidelity will never provide a foundation for the partial defence because every member of the community has the right to exercise his or her personal autonomy in this way. As a select committee member, the Hon. Trevor Khan, stated in the other place previously the problem with a list of excluded behaviour was that if the excluded conduct took place in the context of other provocative behaviour it would be highly artificial and difficult to exclude, for example, allegations of infidelity. 

Despite this restriction, victims of domestic violence will be able to rely upon the partial defence in appropriate cases. Domestic violence, particularly long-term abuse, will generally involve conduct involving serious indictable offences, such as the range of assaults in the Crimes Act 1900. Even where abuse is not physical, but psychological, it may amount to the serious indictable offence of stalking or intimidation set out in section 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. These offences are committed where the perpetrator's conduct is intended to cause the victim to fear physical or mental harm to themselves or another person with whom they have a domestic relationship. These offences are further defined in sections 7 and 8 of that Act to encompass a broad range of behaviours. As sections 7 and 8 make clear, they also envisage the introduction of evidence of past violent conduct, particularly where it involves a domestic violence offence. The concerns of stakeholders that victims of domestic violence may be prejudiced is also addressed by the continued recognition in proposed section 23 (4) that the conduct relied upon need not necessarily have occurred immediately before the act causing death.”


	
	With respect to s.23(2)(c), the Attorney General said:
	


“Proposed section 23 (2) (c) sets out the third step in establishing provocation, namely that the conduct of the deceased caused the accused to lose self-control. The bill retains a loss of self-control as the partial defence's central element. Replacing this with the requirement that the accused felt a ‘justifiable sense of being seriously wronged’, as recommended by the select committee, could significantly expand the use of the law of provocation, contrary to the committee's policy intent. In particular, if there was no requirement for loss of self-control, this could open up the use of the partial defence to situations involving a premeditated plan to

kill. The partial defence should not be available in that situation. If satisfied the accused did lose self-control then the jury moves on to the final limb of the test in proposed section 23 (2)(d).”


	
	The Attorney General turned to s.23(2)(d) and said:
	


“Proposed section 23 (2) (d) further tightens the test by requiring the jury to apply a purely objective test. They must consider whether the provocative conduct was so extreme that an ordinary person could have lost self-control to the extent of forming an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The removal of the words in the existing section ‘in the position of the accused’ will have the effect of removing the need for the jury to assume that the ordinary person has been provoked to the level that the accused was, because they will be determining whether an ordinary person could have been so far provoked as to have lost self-control and formed the requisite intent when faced with that conduct. This will simplify the jury's task and provide for a greater focus on ordinary community standards. Although the select committee did not propose this change, it is consistent with its intention to restrict the use of the partial defence, reduce its complexity and bring it into line with community standards. It is hoped that this focus will ensure that cases such as that of Singh, which caused justifiable outrage in the community, will be a thing of the past.”


	
	A little later, the Attorney General said:
	


“I stress that the use of the partial defence requires, first, that the provocative conduct amount to a serious indictable offence; secondly that the accused lost self-control in response to it and; thirdly, that the behaviour constituting the serious indictable offence was so extreme that an ordinary person could also have lost self-control and formed the requisite intent.”


	
	The Attorney General said:
	


“New section 23 (3) (b) also excludes the use of the defence in situations where the accused has incited the provocative conduct in order to use violence in response. New section 23 (4) provides that conduct of the deceased may constitute extreme provocation even if it did not occur immediately before the act causing death. As mentioned previously, this will provide protection for victims of long-term abuse in slow burn situations and is consistent with the current section 23 (2) (b).”


	
	The Attorney General observed that the Bill was “intended to deliver a limited and targeted partial defence”.
	
	
	In concluding the second reading speech, the Attorney General said:
	


“The select committee also recommended that section 23 explicitly require that trial judges leave the partial defence to a jury only where there is reasonable evidence of it. Under common law only where there is reasonable evidence of partial and full defences must the trial judge explain the relevant law and direct the jury to consider it in reaching its verdict. To legislate this in relation to the partial defence of provocation alone would again serve only to complicate and confuse matters.”

Resolution of Issues Concerning Construction and Operation of s.23 in this Case


	
	Given the constraints of time to determine the issues raised on this pretrial hearing, I will not recount in any detail the submissions of the parties on the issues raised for consideration. Written submissions were provided by the Crown (MFIs 22 and 24) and on behalf of the Accused (MFI 23). The oral submissions of counsel are contained in the transcript of the pretrial hearing (PT96-161). Further written submissions were provided by the Crown (MFI 25) and the Accused (MFI 26) after the Court had reserved its decision on these matters. I have had regard to all submissions.
	
	
	It is appropriate to move directly to the real issues in contest between the parties concerning the operation of s.23 Crimes Act 1900 in this case.
	
	
	It should be kept in mind that for extreme provocation to be left to the jury the question is whether there is any evidence that the act causing death was in response to extreme provocation: s.23(7). This requirement relates back to the four elements of extreme provocation contained in s.23(2) of the Act. There must be some evidence of each of the elements for extreme provocation to be left to the jury.
	


Submissions on s.23(2)(b)


	
	With respect to s.23(2)(b), the Crown submitted that the conduct of Mr Turner, which the Accused sought to rely upon as a stalking or intimidation offence under s.13, occurred whilst Mr Turner was discharging his function as a compliance officer for the purpose of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. In so acting, the Crown submitted that any conduct complained of, which was sought to be characterised as stalking or intimidation, will not lie within a s.13 offence when carried out in the course of enforcing compliance with a law or laws of the State of New South Wales.
	
	
	Upon this basis, the Crown submitted that the various matters complained of could not constitute a s.13 offence. The matters raised allege rudeness, abruptness, statements to persons that their conduct may constitute an offence which might be punished and suggestions by the Accused that certain investigatory steps concerning discussions with persons, entry onto premises and the taking of photographs may not have been in accordance with statutory powers. The Crown submission was elaborated upon, but the essence of the argument may be summarised in this way.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused submitted that the question whether the conduct of Mr Turner was an offence of stalking or intimidation under s.13 permitted an examination as to whether the alleged acts of Mr Turner (about which complaint is made) were authorised by one or other of the provisions contained in Part 5 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (ss.33-45A). It was submitted that there is nothing in s.13 that requires that, as an element of the offence, the person was acting without lawful power or authority nor was there any basis to imply such an element.
	
	
	In elaborating on this point, it was submitted for the Accused that there is no equivalent to s.213 Police Act 1990 applicable to the performance of duties under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. Accordingly, it was submitted, there is no form of statutory immunity from criminal or civil liability. It was submitted that any defence of justification that may arise could be relied upon by the Crown in the trial to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased did not commit a serious indictable offence. It was submitted that evidence of the deceased acting or purporting to act within powers provided by the Native Vegetation Act 2003 could be relied upon by the Crown to negative the s.23 defence beyond reasonable doubt. Further submissions were made on this topic, but I have sought to summarise once again the essence of the argument.
	


Decision on s.23(2)(b)


	
	I accept the submissions of the Crown on this issue. I approach the matter upon the basis that the context in which Mr Turner came into contact with the Accused involved the fulfilment of his functions under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The material before the Court at this pretrial hearing (to which reference has been made above) indicates that this was the context for any contact or dealings between Mr Turner and the Accused between 2011 and 29 June 2014. This view is fortified by the Accused’s tendency notice and accompanying material, to which further reference will be made.
	
	
	It may be accepted that conduct which constitutes a stalking or intimidation offence under s.13 may fall within s.23(2)(b). So much was acknowledged by the Attorney General in the course of the second reading speech referred to at [60] above. The context for the Attorney General’s comments, of course, was conduct within a domestic relationship over a period of time which could fall within s.13.
	
	
	I accept that a s.13 offence is not confined to conduct in a domestic setting. However, where the conduct sought to be relied upon as a s.13 offence is that of a public officer exercising compliance or enforcement functions, I consider that conduct is only capable of constituting a s.13 offence if it falls completely outside the exercise of the public officer’s functions. By that I mean that the conduct in question must be detached entirely from the officer’s employment functions.
	
	
	It is not sufficient to raise potential s.13 liability that the officer may have been rude, abrupt, perhaps even overzealous in the performance of functions in the course of employment. The issue under consideration here is not one of best practice, but whether conduct may constitute a serious criminal offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused invited the Court to have regard to the matters contained in the psychiatric reports relied upon by the Accused with respect to the partial defence of substantial impairment (PT159, 12 April 2016). These are the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 11 February 2016 and Professor David Greenberg dated 23 February 2016. I note, as well, that the Court has been provided with the report of Dr Adam Martin dated 17 February 2016 upon which the Crown relies. Each psychiatrist has spoken to the Accused about the events which are said to relate to what occurred on 29 July 2014. I have considered what the Accused has said to the psychiatrists for the purpose of assisting on the s.13 offence issue. I have also taken into account the words attributed to the Accused on 29 July 2014 upon which his counsel relies with respect to the s.13 issue (see [31]-[34] above).
	
	
	I have considered this material in conjunction with the material relied upon by the Accused in support of his application to adduce tendency evidence. This material includes outlines of what may be said by Anna Simmons, Ivan Maas, John Kennedy, Judith Grills and Lynn Hudson.
	
	
	Looking at the factual material as presently identified at this pretrial hearing, I can see no basis for the Accused to meet the threshold requirement of s.23(2)(b).
	
	
	It may be the case that a person who is being spoken to about possible breaches of the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (let alone being prosecuted for such alleged conduct), may feel harassed or under pressure or will experience other negative feelings towards the officer whose task it is to ensure compliance with these laws.
	
	
	The material before the Court contains a number of examples of the person complaining about what happened to them, expressing conclusions or opinions that he or she felt harassed or threatened by the conduct. The expression of opinions or conclusions to this effect does not raise s.13. As I have said, it may be expected that the exercise of functions of a compliance officer (which may involve prosecution or other remedial action requirements), may upset persons and render them apprehensive as to what may happen. An explanation by the officer that penal consequences may result could likewise lead to concerns, stress or apprehension of adverse consequences. In my view, however, that is a long way from a viable basis upon which s.23(2)(b) could be raised by reference to a stalking or harassment offence under s.13.
	
	
	I do not accept the defence submission that the issue in this case may involve consideration as to whether acts or statements of Mr Turner are supported by particular powers contained in Part 5 of the Native Vegetation Act 2003. Nor do I accept that the absence of a provision such as s.213 Police Act 1990 has some bearing upon the present question. The presence or absence of a similar provision in the legislative scheme which relates to Mr Turner does not, in my view, have relevance to the issue presently under consideration.
	
	
	Section 23(4) provides that the conduct of the deceased may constitute extreme provocation even if the conduct did not occur immediately before the act causing death. This reflects the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the present s.23 in 2014.
	
	
	It must be observed, however, that the material before the Court at this pretrial hearing does not point to any interaction between Mr Turnbull and the Accused from June 2012 until the day of the shooting, 29 July 2014. It may have been that the two men were in the same place at the same time during the Land and Environment Court hearing in March 2014 and at a meeting which may have occurred between the parties and their legal representatives in association with that proceeding.
	
	
	It is apparent that the legislature determined that the previous law of provocation be narrowed significantly when replaced in 2014 by the new concept of extreme provocation. Although there may be scope, as the Attorney General noted in the second reading speech, for a “slow burn” situation to fall within s.23, that observation was made with respect to domestic violence (see [60] and [64] above).
	
	
	Having regard to all the material to which I have made reference, I am not persuaded that this material constitutes evidence that the conduct of Mr Turner was a serious indictable offence (a s.13 offence) for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The conclusion I have reached on this issue is sufficient to dispose of the live question at this pretrial hearing. However, given that submissions were made on other aspects of the construction of s.23 as well, I will express my views with respect to some of them.
	


Some Other Aspects of s.23 Crimes Act 1900


	
	It was submitted by the Crown that the “ordinary person” test now contained in s.23(2)(d) is a purely objective test which does not take into account any attribute of the Accused person. It was submitted for the Accused that, although the words “in the position of the accused” which appeared in the previous form of s.23 had been removed, the section should be construed as requiring the “ordinary person” test to take into account at least some attributes of the Accused.
	
	
	I prefer the submissions of the Crown on this aspect. I do not think that the comments of the Attorney General in the second reading speech (at [62] above) support the Accused on this aspect. Indeed, they support the Crown submission that what is involved is a “purely objective test”. The focus of s.23(2)(d) is the application of the “ordinary person” test taking into account ordinary community standards.
	
	
	Parliament removed the words “in the position of the accused” which had appeared in the pre-2014 section.
	
	
	This is a clear reflection of the legislature’s intention to narrow significantly the scope for s.23 extreme provocation to apply. The fact that this may render it more difficult for an accused person to raise extreme provocation appears to be a consequence of the legislative intention to narrow significantly this aspect of the law (as to the previous law, see Heron v The Queen [2003] HCA 7; 77 ALJR 908 at 922-923 [84]-[87]).
	
	
	It should be kept in mind that s.23(2)(d) requires some evidence that the conduct of the deceased “could” have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. The operation of the objective test, to this extent at least, remains similar to its predecessor: Heron v the Queen.
	
	
	Submissions were made, as well, concerning the construction and operation of s.23(2)(a) of the Act. In my view, the term “towards or affecting the accused” in that provision requires the conduct of the deceased to be directed personally as between the two persons or, at least, that the conduct of the deceased affect the accused person in a manner which can be understood in the context of the extreme provocation provisions in s.23. By way of example, if Mr Turner was investigating other persons (such as relatives or friends of the Accused), the fact that the Accused may be upset or irritated by that action is not such as could fall within s.23(2)(a) of the Act.
	
	
	It is necessary to construe the various components in s.23(2) together, in a cohesive fashion, with the purpose or object underlying s.23 as enacted in 2014 being kept in mind: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.
	
	
	The concept of official action being taken by a public officer against a person, even if it involved rude, aggressive or upsetting language or alleged overzealous action is, in my view, beyond the purview of s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 and of s.23 as enacted in 2014.
	
	
	In closing this part of the judgment, I am assisted by some statements made in R v Peisley (1990) 54 A Crim R 42 at 48-49, where the Court of Criminal Appeal held that provocation under the old s.23 had not been raised so that there was no error on the part of the trial Judge in not leaving it to the jury. Wood J (Gleeson CJ and Grove J agreeing) said at 48:
	


“In my view his Honour was not in error in holding that there was no evidence, in this case, fit to go to the jury, of any loss of self control. More is required than anger or loss of temper or building resentment. There must, in my view, be a loss of self control which I understand to include a state in which the blood is boiling or a state of fear or terror, in either case, to the point where reason has been temporarily suspended. See East Pleas of the Crown (1803) vol 1 at 251.

Here, it seems to me, that the evidence could not rise above a state of anger on the part of the appellant, arising out of an assessment by him that he was sick and tired of what he considered to be unreasonable conduct of Forrester and Rixon, leading to a decision to go over and give them a good scare.”


	
	Wood J said at 49:
	


“In the present case, even assuming in favour of the appellant, that the entire history of disharmony and conflict are properly to be taken into account, including the hearsay allegations, this was not, in my view, a case where the evidence was capable of establishing that any loss of selfcontrol was induced by either the earlier conduct of Rixon or Forester, or the final act of Rixon in laughing at the appellant.”


	
	Although expressed in a different factual setting and in the context of the previous s.23, some of the language used by Wood J is capable of application to this case.
	


The Tendency Notice


	
	The tendency notice served on behalf of the Accused sought to identify the alleged tendencies of Mr Turner in the following way (emphasis added):
	


“2.   The first tendency sought to be proved is Mr Turner’s tendency to act in a particular way, namely:

(a)   to make threats towards persons connected with investigations he was conducting into land clearing;

(b)   to engage in persistent contact with or stalking persons connected with investigations he was conducting into land clearing, including accessing properties without prior warning or consent arrangements with the land owner;

(c)   to engage in persistent contact with or harassment or intimidation of persons connected with investigations he was conducting into land clearing;

(d)   to behave in an aggressive manner towards persons connected with investigations he was conducting into land clearing.

3.   The second tendency sought to be proved is Mr Turner’s tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely knowledge that engaging in the conduct described in paragraphs 2(a) to 2(d) above, was likely to cause a person to fear mental or physical harm (including harm to property).”


	
	As I have mentioned, the further and better particulars of the tendency notice provided by the Accused’s solicitors on 4 April 2016 annexed outlines of what was expected to be said by:
	



	
	Anna Simmons (concerning an event in August 2012);
	
	
	Ivan Maas (concerning events in 2011 and 2012);
	
	
	John Kennedy (concerning events in 2009 and 2010);
	
	
	Judith Grills (concerning an event in July 2014); and
	
	
	Lynn Hudson (concerning an event in 2007).
	



	
	The recital of the suggested tendencies at [100] above, indicates that the conduct complained of was all undertaken in connection with Mr Turner’s exercise of statutory functions concerning land clearing and compliance with the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The particular alleged events relied upon in the outlines of the nominated persons all fall within the description of conduct which I have mentioned earlier (see [77] above).
	
	
	The Crown complained about various aspects of the tendency notice, arguing that it did not comply with the requirements of Clause 5 Evidence Regulation 2015 in a number of respects. It is not necessary to consider the particular complaints made by the Crown because there are, in my view, more fundamental difficulties with this foreshadowed evidence.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the Accused did not seek to place any evidence before the Court at this pretrial hearing concerning the account of the Accused on matters bearing upon this topic. He submitted that the Accused had a right to silence which was not reduced in this regard by any of the case management provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Ling (1996) 90 A Crim R 376 at 379-380, where it was observed that case-flow management rules of the Magistrate’s Court did not require pretrial disclosure of the defence case and should not be interpreted as abrogating an accused person’s right to silence.
	
	
	As the Crown submitted, there are significant differences between a statutory pretrial case management scheme, as now contained in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and rules of the Magistrate’s Court considered in R v Ling. That said, it is not necessary in this judgment to expand upon the ways in which the case management provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 may impact upon an accused person’s right to silence.
	
	
	The Court will proceed to rule upon the Accused’s foreshadowed reliance on tendency evidence on the material which is before the Court on this pretrial hearing.
	
	
	The position is different to that which ordinarily occurs where the Crown communicates an intention to rely upon tendency evidence and where the whole Crown case has been disclosed, so that the proposed tendency evidence can be considered against the background of the Crown case in its entirety.
	
	
	Here, lesser material is before the Court, although the foreshadowed tendency evidence may be considered in conjunction with the material adduced by the Crown on factual matters together with the psychiatric reports (containing accounts of the Accused) which I was invited to consider.
	
	
	Section 97 Evidence Act 1995 provides as follows:
	


“97    The tendency rule

(1)    Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a)    the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b)    the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2)    Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a)    the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b)    the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

Note. The tendency rule is subject to specific exceptions concerning character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111). Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.”


	
	For the purpose of s.97(1)(a), the Accused served a tendency notice and later particulars with respect to that notice so that the Crown is on notice of the intention of the Accused to adduce the evidence. There has been, as I have mentioned, complaint made by the Crown concerning the content of the notice and the particulars. I do not pause to consider this aspect further at this stage.
	
	
	It is necessary that the proposed tendency evidence be relevant (under ss.55-56 Evidence Act 1995) so that the Court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the Accused, “have significant probative value”.
	
	
	The proposed tendency evidence is said to be relevant to the alleged serious indictable offence nominated for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) of the Act, namely a s.13 stalking or intimidation offence. I have already concluded that the Accused encounters difficulty in raising that issue in this trial.
	
	
	The proposed tendencies advanced on behalf of the Accused, as set out at [100] above, fortify my view that the conduct about which the Accused seeks to complain all falls within the exercise of Mr Turner’s functions under the Native Vegetation Act 2003. The proposed tendency evidence contained in the outlines confirms this understanding.
	
	
	In circumstances where I consider that what is sought to be relied upon cannot fall within s.23(2)(b), I do not accept that the proposed tendency evidence is relevant. I do not conclude that the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings: s.55(1) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Further, even if there was some relevance demonstrated, I am not satisfied that the proposed evidence has “significant probative value” for the purpose of s.97(1)(b) Evidence Act 1995. The use of the word “significant” in s.97 mandates that the evidence must be of importance or of consequence: R v Martin [2000] NSWCCA 332 at [67]. It must be evidence that is meaningful in the context of the issues at trial and must be more than merely relevant: AW v R [2009] NSWCCA 1 at [47].
	
	
	I decline to permit the Accused to rely upon the suggested tendency evidence communicated in the notice of 15 March 2016 and as particularised in the letter of 4 April 2016.
	


Conclusion


	
	The conclusions which I have reached in this judgment are that:
	



	
	the conduct of Mr Turner relied upon by the Accused and as identified in this judgment is not capable of constituting a serious indictable offence under s.13 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 for the purpose of s.23(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900;
	
	
	the application of the Accused to rely upon tendency evidence is declined.
	



	
	As there is a possibility (perhaps theoretical) that the Accused will adduce evidence which is capable of raising the partial defence of extreme provocation under s.23 Crimes Act 1900 within the confines of this judgment, I cannot determine finally that such a partial defence should not be left to the jury. That said, I have had regard to all material before the Court at this pretrial hearing and, upon the construction of s.23 which I have adopted, it may be difficult to conceive a basis upon which this partial defence could be left to the jury.

2701779,R v Dent [2016] NSWSC 444,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender, Anthony Richard Dent, is to be sentenced for the murder and robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm of Mr Anthony Thomas O'Grady at Wickham on 25 March 2014. He pleaded not guilty but was found guilty by a jury in a trial in Sydney in February this year.
	
	
	The offender is also to be sentenced for three offences of contempt of court to which he has pleaded guilty. These relate to his conduct in court during pre-trial hearings.
	


Facts


	
	On the afternoon of 25 March 2014 the offender was at his home, a flat in Hanbury Street Mayfield, in the company of Jeffrey Schott, RC and JM. He consumed the drug ice (methylamphetamine). A discussion took place as to the need to get money in relation to drugs. It was suggested that Mr Anthony O’Grady was a possible target for the commission of a robbery in that he was known to have a lot of money and was in the habit of carrying around about $500. (Mr O'Grady lived in relatively modest circumstances but he had recently received an inheritance from his late mother's estate and was known to be generous.)
	
	
	The plan entailed JM, who knew Mr O’Grady, to introduce him to the offender. Mr O’Grady was to be enticed to attend a “party” at Wickham Park on the pretext that there would be alcohol and girls.
	
	
	JM and the offender left the Hanbury flat and went to a location where Mr O’Grady was drinking with a friend. JM spoke to him and introduced him to the offender a short time later. They accompanied him to Hamilton. Mr O’Grady purchased a bottle of Jim Beam and then accompanied the offender and JM to Wickham Park.
	
	
	Jeffrey Schott and RC had travelled separately to Wickham Park in order to await the arrival of the others.
	
	
	The offender, JM and Mr O'Grady walked across Passmore Oval within Wickham Park. Mr O’Grady stopped to roll a cigarette. The offender took the opportunity to strike him heavily to the head causing Mr O’Grady to fall to the ground unconscious.
	
	
	The offender sent JM to summon the attendance of Mr Schott and RC who came from a nearby location in the park. At the offender’s request, Mr Schott or RC provided a piece of rope. The offender proceeded to remove Mr O’Grady’s shorts and underpants. He tied Mr O’Grady’s hands to his feet behind his back. The offender then tore Mr O’Grady’s underpants into pieces and tied them together in order to fashion a gag which was inserted in Mr O’Grady’s mouth and tied tightly behind his head. He was left hog-tied face down on the ground as the offenders left the park and went off in various directions.
	
	
	The offender went to Hamilton with Mr O’Grady’s bankcard or cards and attempted to use them at an ATM. He was unsuccessful as he did not have the correct PIN. He spent some time at the nearby home of a friend, the late Sidney Ragan, where he left items of Mr O’Grady’s property including the bankcard(s). It seems that from there he returned home.
	
	
	Mr O’Grady was found deceased in the park early the following morning. The cause of death was determined to be an acute subdural haematoma. The forensic pathologist, Dr Vuletic, said that a contributing cause was that ""he had a gag in his mouth and he was face down which caused asphyxiation"". Dr Vuletic referred to the size of the haematoma and said: ""Unless medically treated or surgically treated, it was going to be fatal, and you would not expect anybody to survive more than a few hours at the very most.""
	
	
	Dr Vuletic observed the following injuries:
	


""There were some areas of bruising on the face which were poorly defined, but I think were present. There was bruising inside the mouth and underneath the scalp there was bruising in the left temporal region. That's above the left ear. In addition, there was bruising on the upper and lower limbs, arms and legs.""


	
	Dr Vuletic was asked about the gag around the deceased's mouth. She said it appeared to be very tightly tied around the head. She was asked about its contribution to the cause of death and she said:
	


""I believe that there was a very significant degree of obstruction to his airway, and the fact that not only did he have something blocking his airway, but he was face down on the ground which also could block his nose which was not blocked by the gag, I think undoubtedly had a contributory effect to his death.""


	
	Dr Vuletic said that bruising to Mr O'Grady's face was the result of blunt trauma, likely from direct blows to the middle of the face
	
	
	Dr Vuletic allowed for the possibility that Mr O'Grady may have been able to obtain air through his nostrils but even without the gag, the haematoma presented a critical situation. Being bound with his hands behind his back, tied to his legs, possibly could have served to restrict the ability to breathe. In cross-examination, Dr Vuletic said that estimating the time that it might have taken Mr O'Grady to die was somewhat speculative but she thought it was probably less than eight hours.
	
	
	A police investigation commenced immediately upon the discovery of the body. At some stage in the early phase of the investigation, Mr Schott came forward and provided an account which assisted the police considerably. JM separately came into contact with police and suggested that the offender was the person who they should seek out in relation to the murder of Mr O’Grady.
	
	
	The offender was arrested on 21 April 2014.
	
	
	Records from the offender’s phone were tendered in the trial. The call charge records showed that the offender frequently communicated by either text message or voice call to various people up until the morning of 26 March 2014. Thereafter and until the evening of 30 March he confined his communications by telephone to text messages. I infer that he did so in a misguided attempt to avoid any detection of his phone use. Details of text messages sent by the offender during the evening of 25 March and in ensuing days were also before the jury. Of significance was a text message he sent to an unknown person at 11.26am on 26 March 2014 which read as follows:
	


“Thank u darlin. U have a lovely day, whats left of it and smile that beautiful smile or ur’s. I’m feeling so good I might belt another maggot as its addictive feeling like this. Ha ha. Tony x”


	
	Subsequent messages indicated that the offender was concerned about the possibility of the young person JM informing on him. In one message sent to RC in the early evening of 26 March 2014 he made reference to going fishing. At the conclusion of his evidence before the jury, JM was questioned by the Crown Prosecutor about a comment he made in cross-examination to the effect that he did not reveal his own involvement in the matter when he tipped off police because he was scared; although not scared of being charged. He explained that he was scared because, “the next day I got offered [by the offender] to go on a fishing trip and I know what that means”.
	


Objective seriousness of the offences


	
	Before saying something about the objective seriousness of the offences it should be made clear that findings that are made which are adverse to the offender are made to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offence of murder is considerable. It was committed in the company, or at least the presence, of three others (putting aside a young lady who was there but had no involvement) but it is abundantly clear that the offender was the dominant personality in the group. I am satisfied that he manipulated the others to do his bidding.
	
	
	I accept that robbery was the stated motive for luring Mr O'Grady to Wickham Park. The offender knocked him to the ground and rendered him helpless against the theft of his property. There was then nothing more to be achieved by any further violence, let alone by tying Mr O'Grady up and tightly gagging him in such a way that he was effectively left for dead, lying half-naked in a public park.
	
	
	Consistent with the jury's verdict I am satisfied that this is a case of constructive murder; a killing that occurred in the course of committing a crime carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years or more. However, I am also satisfied that at the time the offender assaulted Mr O'Grady he intended at least to inflict grievous bodily harm. I am also satisfied that when he tightly gagged, hog-tied, and left him face down, if he did not specifically intend that Mr O'Grady should die he at least would have realised that he possibly would. In the end, I do not think he cared one way or the other.
	
	
	Epithets such as ""callous"", ""cruel"" and ""brutal"" easily spring to mind but the mere recounting of the facts themselves makes clear that this is a very grave example of the crime of murder.
	
	
	The robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm offence adds nothing to the offender's criminality over and above the murder. The parties agree that he should be convicted but no penalty needs to be imposed.
	


Matters personal to the offender


	
	The offender was born in September 1960 and so he was aged 53 at the time of the offences. According to a report by Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, he is a single man with no children.
	
	
	He was the third youngest of eight children. He told Dr Allnutt that his parents separated when he was aged two and he was brought up by his sister. He was exposed to domestic violence; he was ""belted"" by his father; and he had little memory of his mother.
	
	
	The offender left school when he was expelled at the age of 14. His employment history is limited to having worked on a fishing boat when he was that age.
	
	
	He first used drugs (cannabis) at the age of about 10. He has used heroin from the age of 30 until he went into custody following his arrest for the present matters. He told Dr Allnutt that he was using methylamphetamine as well in the months prior to then.
	
	
	The offender has an extensive criminal history which commenced in 1974 when he was aged 14 when he was committed to an institution by the Newcastle Children’s Court for a break and enter offence. Without detailing all of his past convictions, notable entries on the history include the following:

	It is notable that the offender was on bail for the two charges of possess prohibited drug (those for which he was sentenced on 1 December 2014) at the time of the commission of the offences concerning Mr O’Grady on 25 March 2014. The extent to which this operates as an aggravating factor is, however, marginal in the light of the very great seriousness of the primary offence.
	
	
	An approximate calculation is that the offender has been behind bars for about 32 or 33 years of his 37 years of adult life. When he has been released on parole he has often breached it and been returned to gaol. That was the situation with the murder sentences for which he was released on parole on 1 July 1992 but within months he returned to custody to serve the balance of parole as well as sentences imposed for offences he committed in breach of that parole. It was also the situation with the sentences imposed on 29 October 2009 where he served the balance of parole until it expired and he was released on 1 December 2013, less than 4 months prior to the commission of the present offences.
	
	
	In the light of that history it does not require any expert psychological assessment to conclude that the offender is institutionalised. It is likely his life has been shaped by the unfortunate circumstances of his upbringing and the early introduction to drugs and interaction with a criminal milieu.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt concluded that the offender did not manifest any significant symptoms of a psychiatric condition and there was no evidence of any significant cognitive impairment or any major medical problems. He considered that the offender's behavioural problems as a child were likely consistent with a conduct disorder. He made diagnoses of substance use disorder, currently in remission secondary to his custodial situation, and antisocial personality disorder.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life. There is also a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The maximum penalty for robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for 25 years. These are statutory guideposts that I am required to bear in mind.
	
	
	A life sentence must be considered for the murder if it is characterised as falling into the worst case category or, in accordance with s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), ""if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"".
	
	
	Mr Austin, counsel for the offender, submitted that the circumstances were not such that a life sentence was appropriate. Learned senior counsel for the Crown accepted that was so, submitting that, having regard to the offender's present age, the ""community interest"" referred to in s 61 can be met by the imposition of a significant determinate sentence.
	
	
	There is almost nothing personal to the offender that would mitigate the penalty to be imposed. It was not submitted that I should find he is remorseful and clearly he is not. He told Dr Allnutt that ""he was sorry the deceased had died because he wasn't meant to die"" but he maintained his denial of responsibility and the blaming of others. In his evidence in the trial he blamed Mr O'Grady for saying something that made him think that Mr O'Grady was a paedophile which prompted him to ""hit him with a combination of punches, knocking him to the ground"". He said that when Mr O'Grady started to revive, RC then kicked him in the head three times rendering him unconscious again. This evidence was patently false and found to be so by the jury.
	
	
	The one matter for which he must receive some credit is that he did not contest all issues at the trial. He conceded that he was responsible for manslaughter and robbery in company. That left the principal issue for the jury to determine as being whether he was responsible for the infliction of grievous bodily harm to Mr O'Grady (which the jury, unsurprisingly in my view, found proved beyond reasonable doubt).
	
	
	The offender's prior criminal record is a substantial one but it cannot lead to the imposition of a sentence which is disproportionate to the gravity of the present offence. Some might think that the fact that he had murdered two people in the past might make the present offence of murder more serious but the law does not operate in that way in relation to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. However, that fact, coupled with the persistent serious criminal offending ever since, leads inexorably to the conclusion that the offender has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In such circumstances, retribution, denunciation, deterrence and protection of the community all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. In relation to the latter of those objectives of sentencing, I am satisfied that the offender represents a danger to society.
	
	
	Promotion of the rehabilitation of an offender is included in the list of ""purposes of sentencing"" in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, in this case the prospect of the offender rehabilitating is very bleak indeed.
	
	
	RC pleaded guilty and was sentenced for offences of manslaughter and robbery in company to a total of 4 years 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. JM pleaded guilty and was sentenced for robbery in company and, having regard to the time he had already spent in custody, he was placed on a good behaviour bond. The circumstances of both men's cases are so different from that of the present offender that no issue of parity arises.
	


Facts in relation to charges of contempt


	
	The trial of the offender was listed to commence before me on Monday, 1 February 2016. There were pre-trial issues to be resolved and it was expected that a jury might be empanelled in the following day or two. Each of the offender, RC and JM were arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty to the charges of murder and robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm. The matter then proceeded with submissions being made by counsel for the Commissioner of Police as to certain orders sought in relation to the evidence anticipated to be given in the trial of JM by an undercover police officer. Counsel was interrupted at an early stage when, quoting from the transcript, the following occurred:
	


""(The Accused Dent commenced to assault Accused [JM] and [RC].)

ACCUSED DENT: Get your fucking hands off me. Fuck off. If I see you again you fat dog I'll kill both of you.

IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ACCUSED DENT AND [JM]

HIS HONOUR: Just for the benefit of the transcript there was a disturbance in the dock which involved the Accused Dent physically assaulting each of the co accused. Mr Dent has been removed from the Court. Is [JM] still here or not?

ROSSER: I don't know if those particular threats were recorded. I certainly heard the words, ""If I see you again I'll kill you, you fat dog"" directed to my client.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. I thought you meant something preceded

ROSSER: Oh, no, your Honour, it was in the course of

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I heard that as well. Is [JM] here or not?

CAVANAGH: He seems to have gone down.

HIS HONOUR: He's gone down as well, has he?

CAVANAGH: He fell over while he was being hit, so I'm not sure how well he is.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: May I suggest that [RC] may need some sort of attention after an attack of that

ACCUSED [RC]: No, I'm fine.

HIS HONOUR: He seemed to have received some heavy blows directly to the top of his head, but he claims he's okay.

ROSSER: He assures me he's all right, your Honour.""


	
	That conduct constituted the first charge of contempt.
	
	
	The offender was removed from the court. I was then told that prior to coming into court that morning the co-accused RC and JM had made approaches through their lawyers to the Crown with an offer to plead guilty to lesser charges and to give evidence for the Crown in the trial of the offender. I expressed concern that with such offers having been made there should have been some forewarning when the three men were to be placed in the dock together that day.
	
	
	A short time later, the offender was returned and occupied the dock on his own when the court moved to deal with a question as to the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence the Crown sought to lead in his trial. That evidence related to the offender having committed murder in relation to the two men he killed in Wickham Park on 20 October 1977 when he was 17 years old. In the middle of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions the following occurred:
	


""ACCUSED DENT: Are you fucking serious or what? Oh, fuck this shit. It's all fucking nonsense. It's nonsense. If you want a kangaroo court do whatever but get on with it. This is fucking nonsense. It was 40 years ago. I was a 17 fucking year old child, you idiot. I'm a 55 year old man. Get on with it.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Dent, you're going to have to learn to behave yourself.

ACCUSED DENT: No, fuck behaviour. It's a Kangaroo Court. Why don't you just fucking do it? Fuck you.

HIS HONOUR: This hearing can proceed in your absence if you wish.

ACCUSED DENT: I couldn't give a fuck. Do you think I care? Do you really think I care?

HIS HONOUR: Mr Austin, I'm minded to have your client removed

ACCUSED DENT: Fuck you. If you ever look at me like that again, I'll come up there and rip your fucking face off, you fucking cunt. You heard me.

AUSTIN: Your Honour, I would ask to speak

HIS HONOUR: The last comment made by Mr Dent was made whilst he was looking directly at me and pointing directly at me. I will consider the matter. Yes, Mr Austin?

AUSTIN: I'm sorry, your Honour, I'd ask for the indulgence of being able to speak with him in conference before the matter proceeds. I'm well aware that it can proceed in his absence, but given what's taken place in court through the course of the morning I've tried to speak to him in the dock on a number of occasions and I've been unsuccessful because of the attitude he's taken. I'd like at least the opportunity to speak to him in the cells.

HIS HONOUR: I'll allow you that opportunity, Mr Austin. Contempt is at the forefront of my mind at the moment. It's not something requiring any urgency but you might speak to him about that as well.""


	
	That conduct constituted the second charge of contempt.
	
	
	The following morning the co-accused RC pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery in company and such pleas were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. JM pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery in company and stealing a motor vehicle and the former was accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment concerning him. Those two men were shortly afterwards removed from the courtroom and the offender brought up. At this point Mr Austin indicated that the offender had withdrawn his instructions from him and his instructing solicitor that morning. Mr Austin said that the offender indicated that he did not want any legal representation in relation to his trial and he did not wish to participate in the trial process which as far as he was concerned could proceed in his absence. At that point Mr Austin and his solicitor withdrew.
	
	
	The offender confirmed that what Mr Austin had informed me was correct. The proceedings that immediately ensued were as follows:
	


""HIS HONOUR: You have a right to appear at your trial without representation.

ACCUSED DENT: Well, I won't be participating at all, full stop.

HIS HONOUR: Just hear me out before you walk off.

ACCUSED DENT: I don't give a fuck what you've got to say. Take me back

HIS HONOUR: No, just remain there, Mr Dent.

ACCUSED DENT: I don't give a fuck what you've got to say.

(Mr Dent temporarily left the dock and returned.)

ACCUSED DENT: You can use all the violence you fucking want. It ain't taking place, you understand? It ain't fucking taking place.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Dent, I just want you to hear

ACCUSED DENT: You don't have to use violence, it ain't taking place.

HIS HONOUR: I just want you to hear what I have to say.

ACCUSED DENT: It's my fucking right not to be here, so fuck off.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Dent, as I was saying, you have the right to appear without legal representation.

ACCUSED DENT: I don't give a fuck.

HIS HONOUR: The consequences for you in relation to this trial are very serious.

ACCUSED DENT: Do what you're gonna do, mate. I don't give a fuck. Aren't you listening?

HIS HONOUR: You are obviously not going to listen to what I have to say now. What I am proposing to do

ACCUSED DENT: You can do whatever you like.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I am going to do what I like and, that is, I am going to stand your matter over until Thursday of this week to give you an opportunity to reflect upon the choices

ACCUSED DENT: Reflect all you like; it ain't going to happen.

HIS HONOUR: in relation to your trial.

ACCUSED DENT: Do what you want to do; do you understand? It ain't going to fucking happen. Nothing's going to change, today, next week, ten fucking years, it ain't going to happen.

HIS HONOUR: Well, I ask you to think about it between now

ACCUSED DENT: I've already thought about it.

HIS HONOUR: and Thursday. I'll have you back on Thursday, all right.

ACCUSED DENT: Aren't you listening to me?

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

ACCUSED DENT: It ain't gonna happen. Thank you.""


	
	The offender was then removed from the court. That conduct constituted the third charge of contempt.
	
	
	The charges of contempt were read out to the offender when the jury had retired to consider their verdict on the morning of Thursday, 18 February 2016. They were in the following terms:
	


Count 1: On 1 February 2016 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in proceedings between the Crown and yourself and two co-accused persons you did disrupt proceedings by assaulting and threatening the two co-accused persons in the dock thereby interfering with the administration of justice.

Count 2: On 1 February 2016 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in proceedings between the Crown and yourself you did disrupt submissions being made by the Crown Prosecutor on a point of law with foul, abusive and threatening language directed at the Crown Prosecutor and the trial judge thereby interfering with the administration of justice.

Count 3: On 2 February 2016 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst in proceedings between the Crown and yourself you did conduct yourself in a manner of extreme disrespect for the authority of the Court by the use of foul and abusive language and by attempting to leave the court room without permission thereby interfering with the administration of justice.


	
	The offender was given the opportunity to speak with his lawyers and later that morning he was formally charged and entered pleas of guilty to each of them.
	


Assessment of sentence for the offences of contempt


	
	In In the Matter of Steven Smith (No. 2) [2015] NSWSC 1141, Wilson J helpfully provided the following summary of sentencing principles for the offence of contempt:
	


""[36] Upon conviction for an offence of contempt of court an offender is to be punished as for the commission of a criminal offence. As a common law offence, there is no maximum penalty specified by statute; instead the penalty for contempt is at large. Where a penalty is at large the only restrictions upon the sentence that may be imposed are those that are a natural consequence of the principles relevant to the imposition of criminal penalty, and as provided by the Tenth Article of the Bill of Rights 1688 (UK): Smith v R (1991) 25 NSWLR 1 at 15–18; Wood v Galea (1997) 92 A Crim R 287 at [290].

[37] The Supreme Court Rules 1970 provide for sentences including a fine or imprisonment. Part 55, r13 is in the following terms.

'(1) Where the contemnor is not a corporation, the Court may punish contempt by committal to a correctional centre or fine or both.

(2) …

(3) The Court may make an order for punishment on terms, including a suspension of punishment or a suspension of punishment in case the contemnor gives security in such manner and in such sum as the Court may approve for good behaviour and performs the terms of the security.'

[38] Rule 13 is a declaratory rather than an exhaustive statement of the penalties that may be imposed: Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Maniam (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 309 at 314; Attorney-General for NSW v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314 at 320; Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court of NSW v Jando (2001) 53 NSWLR 527 at [37].

[39] The authorities have identified different categories of contempt, being technical contempt, wilful contempt, and contumacious contempt. The least serious category is that of technical contempt, whilst the most serious is contumacious contempt. This latter category encompasses acts of wilful and intentional defiance of the court’s authority, such that the proper administration of justice is diminished.

[40] There is no “tariff” for an offence of contempt: Wilson v The Prothonotary [2000] NSWCA 23 at [42]; R v Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366; 166 A Crim R 132 at [89].

[41] The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applies: Jando at [42] – [45]. …""


	
	To that collection of sentencing principles I would respectfully add reference to Director of Public Prosecutions v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 732 where, at 741, it was said that it is appropriate to bear in mind the purposes of punishing the contemnor: emphatic denunciation and effective deterrence.
	
	
	The maximum penalty provided for a similar statutory offence may provide a guide as to the seriousness with which such conduct is regarded by the legislature and the community: R v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314 at 319. The second charge of contempt in this case is similar, but not identical, in nature to the offence in s 326 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of threatening to cause injury to a judicial officer. The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is imprisonment for 10 years. That provides something of a bench mark but it is far from having any determinative significance.
	
	
	The gravamen of that part of the second offence which involved a threat of personal physical injury to a judicial officer whilst presiding in court is not so much concerned with the personal dignity of a judge but in protecting from the mischief that will occur if the authority of the courts is undermined or impaired: Prothonotary v Wilson [1999] NSWSC 1148 at [21].
	
	
	The contempt of the offender in each of the three instances is a serious example of such an offence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they each involved wilful and extreme defiance and disregard for the authority of the court. The third offence is to some degree less serious than the others in that it was confined to the use of foul and abusive language whereas the first involved physical violence which disrupted proceedings and the second involved foul and abusive language, a disruption of proceedings and a threat of physical violence to the presiding judge.
	
	
	Unlike many cases of contempt, the offender's conduct is not explained by some disappointment or dissatisfaction with the outcome of the proceedings. Indeed, the proceedings had hardly commenced and no interlocutory ruling adverse to the offender had been made. When Mr Austin of counsel had his instructions restored and announced on Monday 8 February 2016 that he was in a position to proceed with the trial he spoke of potential difficulties with the offender's conduct in the presence of the jury. Included in what he said was the following that might serve as some explanation for the conduct underlying each of the contempt charges:
	


""He has conceded that he has serious anger/self-control issues. He roots those to something your Honour will be aware of which was tendered during the course of the argument on tendency evidence that's his criminal record that most of his adult life has been spent in prison, that it stems from that particular life experience.

He has raised with me and I have indicated to him that this would be purely an indulgence of the Court that he still feels that there are times when he can't control himself and he wishes to be given the indulgence of indicating to his solicitor if he's losing self-control and asking for a brief adjournment to leave the Court to regain composure. That is one option in relation to the difficulty that I see this trial facing that I have indicated to him, if there were to be outbursts of temper in front of the jury in these proceedings.""


	
	Whilst, to some extent, this might serve to provide some understanding of why the offender behaved as he did, it does nothing to mitigate the seriousness of his misconduct. Fortunately, in the presence of the jury through the course of the trial, the offender maintained his composure and behaved himself in a reasonable fashion.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the offender should receive credit for his early pleas of guilty to these charges. The sentences he will receive for them will be reduced by 25 per cent for that reason. There is otherwise nothing in mitigation. There is nothing in the material before me that suggests that the offender is apologetic for his actions, or at least regrets them.
	
	
	The sentences for these charges should be distinct and in addition to the sentence imposed for the primary offence. In all the circumstances I am satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. There are three sentences to be imposed which each will be a fixed term of imprisonment as there is no utility in also setting a non-parole period. I propose to apply the principle of totality by ordering that the sentences be partially accumulated. The first will date from the date the offender was arrested for the primary offence and the sentence for the latter will be wholly accumulated upon them. I see no need or purpose in adjusting the statutory ratio in the sentence for the primary offence because of the accumulation. The parole period I will allow is sufficient.
	


Family victim impact statement


	
	Before I proceeding to sentence I wish to acknowledge a victim impact statement provided by Mr O'Grady's brother, Mr Paul O'Grady. They both suffered from the passing of their father in 1999 and their mother in September 2013 and through the offender's actions Mr Paul O'Grady has lost the remaining member of his immediate family.
	
	
	Mr O'Grady describes his brother as generous to a fault and considers this to have been his downfall. If I may respectfully say so I think that is probably right. The impact of this crime upon Mr O'Grady has been a heavy one. It has also impacted upon his wife and son. I am grateful for being provided with some insight into the matters set out in the statement which, out of respect, I will not disclose. However, I assure Mr O'Grady that the personal impact this terrible crime has had is fully acknowledged and that he and his family have my sincere condolences.
	


Sentence


	
	For each offence: Convicted
	


Contempt count 1: Sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year dating from 21 April 2014 and expiring on 20 April 2015.

Contempt count 2: Sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year dating from 21 January 2015 and expiring on 20 January 2016.

Contempt count 3: Sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months dating from 21 October 2015 and expiring on 20 April 2016.

Murder: Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 30 years commencing 21 April 2016 and expiring on 20 April 2046 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 10 years expiring on 20 April 2056.

Robbery in company inflicting grievous bodily harm: No penalty is imposed pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

The total effective sentence is one of 42 years with a non-parole period of 32 years. The offender will become eligible for release on parole when the non-parole period expires on 20 April 2046.

		15 April 2016",2016-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701793,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 42) [2016] NSWSC 405,"Judgment EX TEMPORE - REVISED


	
	Before the court is a notice of motion filed on 8 April 2016 on behalf of the accused McNamara seeking the following orders:
	



	
	that the current trial be adjourned until 22 April 2016 at 10am; and in the alternative:
	
	
	that the accused be tried separately; and in the alternative:
	
	
	that the jury be discharged.
	



	
	For reasons to which I will come, the orders which were ultimately sought differed in some respects from the terms in which the motion was pleaded. In addition, by the time the hearing of the motion had concluded, there was a fourth alternative order sought, namely that the proceedings be adjourned until Monday of next week, 11 April 2016.
	
	
	All of the orders sought were opposed by both the Crown and by counsel for the accused Rogerson.
	
	
	The motion was supported by an affidavit of Ali Abbas, solicitor, of 7 April 2016. Mr Abbas was not cross-examined on that affidavit and no objection was taken to it. However in the course of submissions in reply, Mr Waterstreet (who then appeared for McNamara) sought and was granted leave to call further evidence from Mr Abbas in order to, as it were, update the Court as to the efforts which had been made to engage counsel to appear for McNamara in the trial.
	
	
	One of the matters to which Mr Abbas referred in the course of giving that evidence was that earlier today he had made contact with the chambers of Mr Wendler of counsel in an effort to ascertain his availability to appear for McNamara in his trial. Mr Wendler could not take Mr Abbas’ call at the time as he was returning to Sydney from regional NSW.
	
	
	When I resumed at 3.15 this afternoon for the purposes of delivering an ex tempore judgment on the motion, Mr Wendler announced his appearance on behalf of the accused McNamara on the motion. Mr Wendler did not indicate that he was available to appear in the trial.
	
	
	Mr Abbas also made reference to making inquiries over the luncheon adjournment today in relation to the availability of counsel to assume the conduct of McNamara’s case. Those inquiries remained unanswered at the time that he gave evidence. They included an enquiry apparently made to a Mr Lange, Barrister. As matters presently stand, no counsel is available to appear for McNamara in the trial.
	
	
	It is necessary for me to detail, as briefly as I can, the circumstances which resulted in the motion being brought.
	
	
	The joint trial of the two accused commenced before myself and a jury of (then) 15 persons on 1 February 2016. At the time of the commencement of the trial, its estimated duration was three months. Some weeks ago it became apparent to me that the estimate was likely to be exceeded, and exceeded to a substantial degree. Having raised the matter with counsel, I formed the view that an appropriate revised estimate of the trial at that stage was four months. I informed the jury accordingly and indicated to them that I did not now expect the trial to be completed until about mid-May.
	
	
	By Friday 1 April 2016, the trial had reached a point where the Crown case was almost completed. In the days leading up to 1 April I had discussed with counsel the progress of the trial and, in particular, when it was likely that the Crown case would close. I did so, at least in part, for the purposes of appraising the jury of the progress which was being made at that time.
	
	
	The general consensus (as at 1 April 2016) was that the Crown case would close at some stage early on the morning of the following Monday, 4 April. Ms Shead of counsel, who then appeared for McNamara, had previously indicated to me that she had experienced some difficulties in being able to arrange conferences with her client over a weekend at the custodial facility at which he was housed. For that reason, she asked that at the anticipated close of the Crown case on 4 April she be given, in effect, the balance of that day to confer with her client prior to his case being commenced on the following day, Tuesday 5 April.
	
	
	I indicated to Ms Shead that I would be prepared to take that course and, with her consent, I informed the jury on the afternoon of 1 April 2016 of the progress that had been made and the point which had been reached. In particular, I informed the jury that in all likelihood the Crown case would close on the following Monday and that the case for the accused McNamara would commence on the following day, with McNamara to give evidence.
	
	
	On the afternoon of Sunday 3 April 2016, my Associate received an email from the then solicitor for McNamara, Mr Reslan. Mr Reslan advised that a ""complex ethical issue"" had arisen and that despite his best efforts, arrangements could not be made for a conference to take place with McNamara and counsel on that day for the purposes of discussing the issue. He indicated that when the proceedings resumed before me at 9.30am on 4 April an indulgence would be sought for approximately one hour so to allow he and Ms Shead to confer with McNamara. That position was confirmed by Ms Shead when she appeared before me on that day.
	
	
	Upon the resumption of the proceedings at about 10.30am on 4 April 2016, Ms Shead said:
	


""My instructions have been withdrawn and in the circumstances of this case I seek leave to withdraw from the trial"".


	
	No further information was provided to me as to the circumstances which led to that position being reached.
	
	
	At this stage it is necessary for me to make some brief observations regarding those persons who were retained by McNamara for the purposes of the trial. Ms Shead appeared for McNamara as counsel. Ms Shead is a Deputy Senior Public Defender. She was assisted by Mr Devine. Mr Devine is a solicitor employed by Legal Aid New South Wales (“Legal Aid”). However, my understanding was that Mr Reslan was in fact McNamara's solicitor, in the sense that the matter had been assigned to Mr Reslan's firm by Legal Aid.
	
	
	When Ms Shead made her application for leave to withdraw from the proceedings she made it plain that such application extended to herself and to Mr Devine only. For reasons which I must say appeared somewhat obscure, her application did not extend to Mr Reslan. After I had given Ms Shead and Mr Devine leave to withdraw, Mr Reslan appeared before me and made an application that the matter be adjourned so as to allow him time to ascertain the availability of alternative counsel.
	
	
	When I asked Mr Reslan whether he continued to act for McNamara, he responded by saying that he did ""at this stage"". I then brought the jury into court and, with the consent of the Crown, Mr Reslan and Mr Thomas I informed them that an issue had arisen in relation to McNamara's representation through which I was endeavouring to work. What I told the jury would not have come as a complete surprise given Ms Shead's sudden absence from the Bar table. I indicated to the jury that I would continue efforts to resolve the issue and asked them to come back on Thursday 7 April 2016. I expressed some hope the matter might be resolved by that time.
	
	
	Having allowed the jury to depart for the day, I stood the matter down to allow Mr Reslan the opportunity firstly, to clarify and resolve whether he was to continue to act for McNamara and secondly (in the event that he did) to ascertain the availability of alternative counsel. When the proceedings resumed later that day, Mr Reslan told me that his instructions had also been withdrawn. He sought and was granted leave to withdraw from the proceedings.
	
	
	McNamara was then left in a position where he was unrepresented. The transcript of the proceedings on 4 April (commencing at T2898 L12) records the following exchange with myself:
	


HIS HONOUR: Perhaps I should hear from Mr McNamara.

ACCUSED MCNAMARA: My position is that I would desire representation.

HIS HONOUR: You had representation, Mr McNamara.

ACCUSED MCNAMARA: Yes, I did. I would like to apologise to the Court.

HIS HONOUR: Let's get on with it. You say you would like representation. I merely make the observation that you had it and you chose to withdraw it. What else do you wish to say at the moment?

ACCUSED MCNAMARA: I chose to withdraw on the basis of legal advice, not of my own free will. It was on the basis of legal advice that I chose to withdraw. It was the only choice I had. I am not a lawyer, and I took the advice of my lawyers. I have been hamstrung since May last year by being in solitary confinement.


	
	At that stage I interjected and restrained McNamara, as I put it at the time, from making speeches. I also observed that he had not been “hamstrung” in the last ten weeks, having had the benefit of highly competent and professional representation by a senior public defender. That particular observation was one with which McNamara expressly agreed. When I asked him whether or not he had any application to make, he informed me that he wished to adjourn the proceedings for the purpose of attempting to obtain new legal representation. In making that application he informed me that members of his family had already commenced to make enquiries in that regard. Having heard from the Crown and Mr Thomas, I ordered that the matter be adjourned until 7 April for the purposes of giving McNamara the opportunity to ascertain the availability of an alternative legal representative. I also indicated to the parties that I would write to Mr Doumit from Legal Aid, informing him in general terms of the position which had arisen and asking for such assistance as he could provide to the Court.
	
	
	I will return in due course to the statements made by the accused which are set out at [20] above. However it is appropriate at this stage that I make reference to part of the contents of the affidavit of Mr Abbas that was filed in support of the current motion. That affidavit states (at [38]-[39]) as follows:
	


“38. Without any legal advice and in answer to a question from his Honour Justice Bellew, namely, why the applicant withdrew his legal representation, the applicant informed the Court he withdrew his instructions from his then legal representatives because that was the advice he received from his then Counsel; specifically that Mr McNamara withdraw his instructions from her and the instructing solicitor (emphasis added).

39. The applicant does not, to the extent he answered the question posed by the Court, intend to waive legal professional privilege.”


	
	It will be evident from the extract from the transcript at [20] above that to the extent that Mr Abbas asserted (at [38]) that I asked McNamara why he “withdrew his legal representation”, the affidavit is grossly misleading. At no stage did I ask any such question of McNamara. The affidavit seriously misrepresents what in fact occurred.
	
	
	When the matter resumed before me on 7 April 2016 Mr Abbas appeared for McNamara. He told me that he had spoken to Mr Smith SC, who had indicated that he wished the matter to be adjourned until Monday 11 April. The transcript will reflect that when I asked Mr Abbas the purpose of the matter being adjourned until that day, his responses were somewhat nebulous. They amounted, in effect, to foreshadowing the possibility that there may be an application that the jury be discharged, or that the trial be further adjourned. Mr Abbas was unable to inform me which application would actually be made on that day. In terms of a possible application to adjourn the trial, I enquired of Mr Abbas as to the length of any proposed adjournment. He responded by saying that this was a matter about which he ""couldn’t comment"".
	
	
	It was apparent that Mr Abbas was effectively making an application to adjourn the matter to another day, at which time it was intended to make another application. Mr Abbas was unable to tell me what the ultimate application was likely to be. The unsatisfactory nature of that position needs no further comment. I ultimately made orders requiring that a notice of motion be filed, setting out in precise terms the orders sought, together with an affidavit in support. I further ordered that the matter be brought back before me today in order for any such motion to be heard.
	
	
	I have already made reference to the terms of the notice of motion. It is appropriate that I make some brief reference to the contents of the affidavit sworn by Mr Abbas in support of it.
	
	
	It seems that Mr Abbas was first approached at about midday on Tuesday 5 April 2016 by McNamara's daughter, enquiring as to his availability. That was about 24 hours after the proceedings had been adjourned on the previous day. It seems that during the ensuing two days Mr Abbas had conversations with McNamara's daughter. He made one attempt, it seems, to contact McNamara by telephone but was told by a Corrective Services officer that this was not possible. He did not, at any time, make any attempt to attend on McNamara personally. Indeed, he met McNamara for the first time at about 9.15am on 7 April 2016, a short time before the matter was due back before the Court.
	
	
	Mr Abbas also had contact with Mr Smith SC. McNamara apparently expressed some desire that Mr Smith be retained to appear for him in the trial. However on the evidence before me, it seems that Mr Smith is unlikely to be available. Indeed, Mr Abbas said in his affidavit that in the event that the trial was not adjourned, neither he nor Mr Smith would be available to represent the accused.
	
	
	The affidavit also deals with other matters which occurred after the proceedings were before the Court on 7 April. It seems that on the afternoon of that day, Mr Abbas was contacted by Mr Waterstreet of counsel who advised him that the accused's daughter had contacted him (i.e. Mr Waterstreet) and advised him of the outcome of the proceedings earlier that day. It seems that Mr Waterstreet and Mr Abbas spoke with McNamara later on that same day.
	
	
	It is of some significance that Mr Abbas’ affidavit says (at [32]):
	


“Mr Waterstreet made it clear that he would make every effort to be available for the trial if Legal Aid were to approve him to be briefed in the matter and if the presiding Judge grants him leave for the trial to be adjourned so that Mr Waterstreet is able to rearrange his diary however this would require a two week adjournment to allow Mr Waterstreet and I to get up to date in the proceedings and be in a position to cross-examine the OIC (who is currently giving evidence), begin the defence case and address the jury.”


	
	Having said (at [32]) that a two week adjournment would be required to allow Mr Waterstreet to read the material and bring himself up to date with the proceedings, Mr Abbas then said (at [34]):
	


“I have not been involved in the proceedings and would require at least two weeks (if not more) to peruse the material (including the brief and the transcripts) to familiarise myself with the matter in order to prepare adequately for it in my proposed representation of the applicant.”


	
	Mr Abbas confirmed that McNamara's instructions were to proceed with the trial if suitable counsel was found, and sufficient time was given to such counsel to acquaint himself or herself with the material. He went on to say (at [42]) that in the event that that did not occur, McNamara would ""consider"" an application to separate his trial from that of the co-accused Rogerson. As I have indicated, an order that the trials be separate is one of the alternative orders which is now sought in the motion. Finally, Mr Abbas said (at [43]) that in the event that I was not minded to grant orders 1 or 2, he had instructions to make an application to discharge the jury.
	
	
	In submissions made in support of the motion, Mr Waterstreet raised a number of matters. In summarising those submissions, I should deal at the outset with one particular matter, namely Mr Waterstreet's purported reliance upon s. 192 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”) which is in the following terms:
	


192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms

(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d) the nature of the proceeding, and

(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.


	
	Mr Waterstreet submitted that in determining the present application, it was necessary for me to have regard to the matters enumerated in s 192(2)(a) to (e). In my view, s 192 of the Act has no application whatsoever to the present application. The opening words of s. 192(1) make it clear that the section applies in circumstances where application is made under that Act for a court to give leave, permission or direction. The present is not an application for leave, permission or direction under the Act.
	
	
	At the commencement of his submissions, Mr Waterstreet effectively sought to amend the notice of motion by adding the words ""or for such shorter period as the Court may determine” to the terms of paragraph 1. That seemed, to me at least, to reflect an acceptance on the part of Mr Waterstreet that the court may not be prepared to grant an adjournment for the period which was sought in the motion. As I have already indicated, there appeared to be a further amendment sought in the course of submissions by adding an order that the proceedings be adjourned until Monday of next week. In these respects, the application is best described as something of a moveable feast.
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet submitted that in all of the circumstances McNamara wished to have the benefit of counsel appearing for him at his trial. He submitted that McNamara was not in a position to equip himself to defend the matter on his own and submitted that justice would not be done if he was, in effect, forced to appear for himself. Mr Waterstreet submitted that I should treat, as evidence, what McNamara had said to me (at [20] above) regarding the reasons he withdraw his instructions to counsel. He submitted that in all of the circumstances, to require the trial to proceed when McNamara was unrepresented would be unfair, and would result in the trial being significantly and unnecessarily extended.
	
	
	Mr Waterstreet submitted that there ""would be"" members of the Bar who were able to accept the brief. However, he appeared to accept that no member of the New South Wales Bar had been identified as being able to appear for McNamara at any time in the foreseeable future. He indicated that whilst he was not (to use his terminology) ""putting himself forward"" to appear in the matter, he would be prepared to do so if no other counsel could be found. On the basis of Mr Abbas’ affidavit, Mr Waterstreet’s availability would appear to depend upon successfully re-arranging his existing commitments.
	
	
	The Crown opposed all of the orders sought. In doing so, the Crown highlighted the fact that there was no certainty at all that any counsel would become available to assume the conduct of the matter. The Crown made specific reference to Mr Abbas’ affidavit (at [32]). The Crown submitted that I should conclude, on the basis of that paragraph, that not even Mr Waterstreet himself was in a position to assume the conduct of McNamara’s case. .
	
	
	The Crown also drew my attention to Mr Abbas’ affidavit at [38] and [39], the terms of which I have already outlined. The Crown highlighted the fact that no sworn evidence had been given by McNamara as to the circumstances in which he had withdrawn his instructions from his previous counsel, Ms Shead. The Crown submitted that in all of the circumstances McNamara had chosen to claim privilege in respect of his discussions with Ms Shead and that in those circumstances I could not reach any conclusion as to the cause of the position in which he now found himself.
	
	
	In respect of the application for a separate trial, the Crown relied upon the fact that this was a matter about which I had already delivered given judgment. It was submitted that nothing had occurred which would serve to alter the views I expressed on that occasion, namely that in all of the circumstances the accused ought be tried together.
	
	
	At one point the Crown invited me to find that on the whole of the evidence, the present circumstances had arisen as a consequence of a deliberate manipulation of the criminal justice system by McNamara. The transcript will reflect that the Crown ultimately accepted that to reach such a conclusion would involve considerable speculation. As I understood it, the submission was effectively withdrawn. Whether it was withdrawn or not, I make it clear (as I did in the course of submissions) that the evidence does not permit me to make any such finding.
	
	
	As to the application that the jury should be discharged, the Crown highlighted, amongst other things, the obvious circumstance that the trial was now in its tenth week, and that considerable public money had been expended.
	
	
	Mr Thomas generally supported the Crown's position. He highlighted considerations of procedural fairness, and effectively submitted that the steps which had been taken thus far to allow McNamara to retain alternative counsel had discharged whatever obligations of procedural fairness fell upon the Court.
	
	
	He made reference to various parts of the affidavit of Mr Abbas in support of a submission that Mr Abbas had approached the matter in a way which was less than diligent. He also submitted that what Mr Abbas had told me on 7 April about the potential availability of Mr Smith did not reflect the true position. He submitted that if any of the orders sought were made there was a great risk that the integrity of the criminal justice system generally, and the integrity of the trial specifically, would be seriously compromised.
	
	
	Mr Thomas also submitted McNamara was far from an unsophisticated person. He pointed, in particular, to the evidence that McNamara was an author, and a former police officer who was familiar with court procedures. He submitted that McNamara had been given the benefit of the entirety of the brief of evidence being uploaded onto a computer such that it was “at his fingertips”. He submitted that in these circumstances, McNamara would be at no real disadvantage in the event that he was not represented.
	
	
	Finally, Mr Thomas submitted that by way of contrast, and unlike McNamara, Rogerson was not in receipt of a grant from Legal Aid. He explained that Rogerson was, pursuant to a particular arrangement, privately funding his trial. Although it seems that this arrangement is such that Rogerson is not paying Mr Thomas on a regular basis at the present time, I accept that he will ultimately be personally responsible for the payment of the fees of both Mr Thomas and his instructing solicitor.
	
	
	I turn to consider the principles which are applicable to the determination of the motion.
	
	
	In Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292, the majority (Mason CJ and McHugh J) observed (at [7]; 299-300) that the right of an accused person to receive a fair trial according to law is a fundamental element of the criminal justice system, but that there had been no judicial attempt to exhaustively list the attributes of a fair trial. Their Honours went on to consider the provisions of various international instruments, and declarations of rights in other countries, which had attempted to define some of those attributes.
	
	
	Their Honours ultimately concluded that the right of an accused to a fair trial is recognised in this country and that, depending on all of the circumstances of the particular case, a lack of representation may mean that an accused is denied that right. Their Honours also observed that such a conclusion was inextricably linked to the facts of the case and the background of the accused.
	
	
	Significantly, their Honours said (at [31]; 311):
	


A trial judge faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an unrepresented accused is therefore not bound to accede to the application in order that representation can be secured; a fortiori the judge is not required to appoint counsel. The decision whether to grant an adjournment or a stay is to be made in the exercise of the trial judge's discretion, by asking whether the trial is likely to be unfair if the accused is forced on unrepresented. For our part, the desirability of an accused charged with a serious offence being represented is so great that we consider the trial should proceed without representation for the accused in exceptional cases only. In all other cases of serious crimes, the remedy of an adjournment should be granted in order that representation can be obtained.


	
	Their Honours then continued (at [40]; 315):
	


In view of the differences in the reasoning of the members of the Court constituting the majority in the present case, it is desirable that, at the risk of some repetition, we identify what the majority considers to be the approach which should be adopted by a trial judge who is faced with an application for an adjournment or a stay by an indigent accused charged with a serious offence who, through no fault on his or her part, is unable to obtain legal representation. In that situation, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the trial in such a case should be adjourned, postponed or stayed until legal representation is available. If, in those circumstances, an application that the trial be delayed is refused and, by reason of the lack of representation of the accused, the resulting trial is not a fair one, any conviction of the accused must be quashed by an appellant court for the reason that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the accused has been convicted without a fair trial. 


	
	As will be evident from that last passage of their Honours' judgment, the principle which was articulated applies to an accused charged with a serious offence who through no fault on his or her part is unable to obtain legal representation. The issue of fault is one to which I will return.
	
	
	In a subsequent decision of Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58; (1995) 184 CLR 163, the High Court (Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) had cause to return to the observations made in Dietrich to which I have referred and said (at [21]; 183-184):
	


“The effect of those comments was to indicate circumstances in which a trial judge should grant an adjournment or stay until legal representation was available. The reference in them to an accused's inability to obtain legal representation being 'through no fault on his or her part' was not intended to indicate that every instance of misbehaviour, improvidence or other fault on the part of an accused which had contributed to his or her lack of representation must automatically preclude entitlement to a stay. In that regard, we agree with the view expressed by Olsson J in the Full court that:

'… what was in contemplation was a test which focused on the reasonableness of the conduct of the accused in all of the circumstances; and excluded situations in which it could be fairly said that the accused, by his gratuitous and unreasonable conduct, had been the author of his own misfortune.'“


	
	These principles were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Gilfillan [2003] NSWCCA 102. In that case Buddin J made reference (at [4]) to the strong public interest in ensuring, if at all possible, that a criminal trial which was well advanced proceeded to verdict. His Honour observed that accordingly, an adjournment would not readily be granted in such circumstances. However, he emphasised (at [5]) the desirability that an accused person be legally represented at a trial, particularly if he or she is facing very serious charges. His Honour also referred to the decision in BK v The Queen [2000] NSWCCA 4; (2000) 110 A Crim R 298 where Carruthers AJ emphasised (at [33]; 309) the need for a trial judge to be alive to the possibility that an accused person may withdraw instructions from counsel purely in order to obtain an adjournment.
	
	
	In the same case Smart AJ made a number of observations in relation to the approach to be taken in circumstances such as the present. Having referred to the decisions in Craig and Dietrich, his Honour said (commencing at [72]:
	


“[72] Where, as here, a trial has been proceeding for a number of days, and the accused has ceased to have legal representation including where he has withdrawn instructions the matters taken into account may be somewhat broader. They would include the interests of the witnesses, their health, if ill or aged, and their availability.

[73] Unreasonable dispensation of legal representation by an accused during a trial would amount to fault on the part of an accused and usually in such circumstances a trial would not be terminated. Whether an adjournment would be granted would depend on all of the circumstances, for example, fresh legal representation may be able to be obtained within a couple of days, thus enabling the trial to continue.

[74] In applying Craig this Court in DPP v Thomas James Allan (unrep 1 November 1995 per Allen J) observed that the touchstone of the common law was reasonableness and that that applied to the concept of fault.

[75] Circumstances may exist where it is reasonable for an accused to withdraw his instructions even at an advanced stage of the trial. For example, his counsel may be conducting his case in an obviously incompetent fashion or incorrectly disregarding instructions which were not improper or for personal reasons may not feel able to cross-examine a witness adequately. This list is not exhaustive.”


	
	In concluding that error had been established in that particular case, his Honour found that the trial judge had failed to consider the issue of fault or, in other words, had failed to consider whether it was reasonable for the accused to withdraw his instructions.
	
	
	It is against the background of all of those principles that I come to determine the present application.
	
	
	It is clear from the authorities to which I have referred that one of the matters I am required to take into account is the issue of fault, i.e. whether it was reasonable for McNamara to withdraw his instructions from Ms Shead. The only material before the Court which touches on that issue is the statement made by Ms Shead and the statements made by McNamara. Mr Waterstreet submitted that I should regard the statements made by Mr McNamara as evidence. They are not evidence. They are unsworn, untested and unsubstantiated assertions. They are deserving of no weight in those circumstances.
	
	
	On the present application, McNamara bears the onus of proof: BK at [12]; [24]; 305; 308. He has chosen not to give evidence on oath about the circumstances in which he withdrew his instructions from Ms Shead. That is his right. I am therefore left to determine the present application on the remaining evidence which is before me.
	
	
	Speaking purely hypothetically, it may be one thing for an accused to assert that it is unfair that he be forced to represent himself when the circumstances in which his instructions were withdrawn from counsel were no fault of his own. It will be quite another for an accused to assert unfairness in circumstances where the decision to withdraw instructions was made in a calculated fashion, or without proper cause. The evidence in the present case does not permit me to make findings as to the circumstances in which the accused's instructions were withdrawn. I am not able to determine, in the sense referred to in the authorities, that the present circumstances are not the fault of the accused. Equally, I am not in a position to determine that they are his fault. I must therefore resolve questions of suggested unfairness based on the evidence as it stands but in circumstances where, as I have said, McNamara bears the onus of proof.
	
	
	I have already made reference to the amendments which were effectively made to the motion in the course of submissions. In my view, however one might look at it, there are a number of difficulties with any proposal that the proceedings be adjourned, irrespective of the period of adjournment sought.
	
	
	The motion, as originally pleaded, sought a two week adjournment. It was suggested in argument that a period of one week should be allowed. No person has been identified at this stage as being able to appear for McNamara in one week (or for that matter in two weeks). Moreover, the suggestion that the adjournment could be limited to one week is fundamentally at odds with the affidavit evidence of Mr Abbas who asserted he would need at least two weeks, and possibly more, for the purpose of preparing the matter. How it could be suggested, in all of those circumstances, that there would be any utility whatsoever in adjourning these proceedings for one week (or for that matter two weeks) is not at all apparent. One asks, rhetorically, what would happen at the conclusion of such a period if it were to remain the case that no Barrister was identified as being available? The answer is that the matter would be no further advanced, but would have been further delayed.
	
	
	The suggested “fall back” position, as I have indicated, was that Mr Waterstreet could somehow re-arrange his diary and appear in the trial. Once again, on the evidence before me, Mr Waterstreet would require a period of two weeks for that purpose. On the evidence, there is no certainty that even if he is given that time, he will be available. Moreover, and whilst ultimately it would obviously be a matter for Mr Waterstreet, I am compelled to observe that in the course of these proceedings last year Mr Game SC appeared on Mr Waterstreet's behalf (Mr Waterstreet having previously appeared for McNamara) and informed me he had advised Mr Waterstreet that he was bound to return the brief: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 14) [2015] NSWSC 1157 at [10]. Mr Waterstreet’s return of the brief saw the trial vacated. It is not immediately apparent to me how, in those circumstances, Mr Waterstreet could now accept the brief, although I again stress that that would ultimately be a matter for Mr Waterstreet and not me.
	
	
	I accept that there have been inquiries made of a number of members of the Bar as to their availability to take over the trial. Those inquiries have met with no success. The proposal that the proceedings be adjourned for a week or two weeks in those circumstances, in my view, redolent with uncertainty. It serves no purpose whatsoever. The application for an adjournment should be refused.
	
	
	The application for a separate trial has already been dealt with: R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 3) (2015) NSWSC 965. In that judgment I concluded that the circumstances of this case required that the two accused be tried together. Those circumstances have not changed. Nothing has been put before me today to cause me to revisit the issue. I remain of the view that in all of the circumstances, the accused should be tried together.
	
	
	I turn to the application that the jury be discharged. The judgment of Smart AJ in Gilfillan recognised that in circumstances such as this, there may be a number of factors which impinge upon the exercise of the relevant discretion. His Honour referred, amongst other things, to a circumstance where a trial has been proceeding for a number of days. The present trial has been proceeding for a period of ten weeks. The Crown case is all but closed. The members of the jury have displayed an unwavering commitment to this trial. They have given up a significant portion of their lives in service to the community. While questions of public expense and convenience cannot be determinative, they are relevant. In the present case they weigh in favour of the trial proceeding, and very much against the jury being discharged.
	
	
	I must also take into account the circumstances of the co-accused Rogerson. He is not, as I have said, in receipt of a grant of legal aid. He is, in the way in which Mr Thomas outlined, privately funding in this trial. He is entitled to have the trial against him proceed. In circumstances where a separate trial is not appropriate, the circumstances of Rogerson also weigh in favour of the matter proceeding. Wherever the fault may lie for the present situation, it does not lie at his feet.
	
	
	For the reasons given, and in circumstances where he has chosen to adduce no evidence of the circumstances in which he withdrew his instructions from Ms Shead, McNamara’s trial must proceed, notwithstanding that he will be unrepresented.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The notice of motion is dismissed.
	
	
	The trial will proceed before the jury at 10am on Monday 11 April 2016.

2701808,Woods v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) ; Fantakis v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 447,"ex tempore judgment (rEVISED)


	
	Three applications for judicial review of various decisions of Magistrates in the course of committal proceedings have been listed for hearing before me today. There are two plaintiffs: Mr Andrew Keith Woods and Mr Terry Fantakis.
	
	
	Mr Woods challenges two decisions made in the course of the proceedings, both of which were made by his Honour, Magistrate Still. Mr Fantakis challenges the same two decisions of Magistrate Still but also challenges two decisions made by his Honour, Magistrate Mijovich on 11 January 2016 and 18 January 2016 respectively.
	
	
	On 24 April 2015, his Honour, Magistrate Still dealt with the application made by each of the plaintiffs under s 91 for the attendance of witnesses to give oral evidence at the committal proceedings. His Honour made certain orders for the attendance of witnesses by consent but denied other orders sought by each plaintiff requiring mainly police witnesses to attend to give oral evidence.
	
	
	The decision of 21 December 2015 was a procedural decision fixing Mr Fantakis' argument concerning a subpoena issued to the Commissioner of Police on 11 January 2016 and listing the committal for hearing on 18 January 2016.
	
	
	In any event, on the 18th the matter was allocated to his Honour, Magistrate Mijovich for the hearing of the committal proceedings. He also dealt with the subpoena argument on 11 January 2016.
	
	
	Mr Fantakis is aggrieved by the decision on the subpoena argument, in that most of the categories of document that he required to be produced under subpoena were disallowed by his Honour. As things transpired, the committal proceedings did not proceed on 18 January 2016 but were adjourned for a hearing commencing on 11 April 2016, that is to say Monday.
	
	
	On 12 January 2016 Mr Woods filed his summons seeking judicial review in this Court in Matter No 2016/10749. On 15 January 2016 Mr Fantakis filed his first summons in Matter No 2016/14432. Both of those summonses, as I have said, impugn the decisions of 24 April 2015 and 21 December 2015.
	
	
	Following the adverse decision from Mr Fantakis' point of view on the subpoena argument, Mr Fantakis made an application on 18 January for his Honour, Magistrate Mijovich, to disqualify himself from further involvement in the matter on the grounds of, substantially, apprehended bias but the summons has the flavour about it of alleging actual bias. As I have said, his Honour declined the application but it seems the proceedings were adjourned until Monday.
	
	
	The judicial review proceedings have been managed in this Court by the Common Law Case Management Registrar. After a number of adjourned directions hearings, which I need not detail, when the matter came before the Registrar on 4 April 2016 the urgency of the matter, given the closeness of the date for the hearing of the oral testimony in the committal proceedings, was appreciated and the matter was referred to Wilson J sitting as the Common Law Division Duty Judge.
	
	
	In an understandable, with respect, attempt to expedite the determination of these matters prior to the date fixed in the Local Court for the oral testimony in the committal proceedings, which have an estimate of five days, her Honour made orders for the urgent production of Local Court transcripts which she had in mind would enable the matters to be heard and determined by me today.
	
	
	One of the difficulties which the plaintiffs have encountered in preparing these matters for hearing is that they are both in custody on remand. The charge they each face, the subject of the committal proceedings, is one of murder.
	
	
	Mr Fantakis, in particular, has been attempting to obtain the transcripts of the various applications and hearings in the Local Court since 23 December 2015 to put himself in a position to prepare the matter for hearing in this Court. His attempts have been unsuccessful. I am prepared to assume that the lack of success has been due to the enormous pressure on the agency responsible for the production of transcripts of court proceedings. It is my experience that in the Local Court or the District Court, transcripts can take some months to be produced. And if an application is made some months after the hearing date, there may be added delay in the provision of the transcript.
	
	
	In any event, the plaintiffs wish to have the opportunity of considering the transcripts for the following dates: 24 April 2015, 22 July 2015, 23 July 2015, 18 December 2015, 21 December 2015, 11 January 2016, 18 January 2016 and 17 January 2016.
	
	
	To facilitate the hearing of the matter and to assist the plaintiffs in their preparation, Wilson J ordered that the agency responsible for the preparation of the transcripts produce a full transcript of the whole of the proceedings on each of those days to the Registrar of this Court by 9.30am on 7 April 2015. Her Honour further directed that upon the receipt of those transcripts the Registrar was to take all necessary steps to provide copies to each of the parties in each of these matters.
	
	
	Unfortunately, when the matter was called on for hearing before me today, it was apparent, or so it then seemed anyway, that her Honour's orders had not been complied with. The only transcript which my chambers had received was that of 17 March 2016, not a date on which any impugned order was made. It transpired that counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions and for the Commissioner of Police, who are joined as parties to each of the matters today, had transcripts for each of the 2016 dates but not for the 2015 dates.
	
	
	I caused enquiries to be made and it seems that the agency had produced the transcripts but there seems to have been a slip in the communication of them from that agency to the Court. Further enquiries have been made and four of the five transcripts from 2015 have now been received. The transcript of 22 July 2015 is yet to be received at all but I expect it is on its way.
	
	
	Mr Woods and Mr Fantakis both apply for an adjournment. They say that even had they received the transcripts yesterday they would have had insufficient time to prepare for a hearing today. It is impossible for them to consider the transcripts, even if they receive them soon, and mount any kind of argument in their cases today.
	
	
	The transcripts are likely to run into some hundreds of pages. The transcript for 11 January alone runs to 77 pages. It is obvious given the time now, no-one, not even an experienced lawyer, would be able to review the transcripts, digest them and summarise the salient features in sufficient time to mount an argument today. And the position of self-represented persons in custody on remand must be much worse, given the limited, perhaps almost non-existent, resources available to them.
	
	
	Mr Smith of counsel for the DPP and Ms Stevens of counsel for the Commissioner of Police accept that it is unreasonable to expect the plaintiffs to mount their arguments today, not having had the benefit of the transcripts previously.
	
	
	I have asked the plaintiffs why it is necessary for them to review the whole of the transcripts of evidence. It seemed to me, at least at first blush, that given the grounds of judicial review put forward – and I appreciate that the plaintiffs say there may be an argument available under Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001(NSW) in relation to questions of law about some of the matters – that only limited information would be necessary to mount what is essentially a legal argument. But having heard the response of each of the plaintiffs to my questions about those matters and given that an argument is to be mounted in relation to alleged breaches of the rules of natural justice, including the apprehended bias of the decision-makers, I accept that it may be relevant to have regard to the course of the proceedings before those decision-makers in order to decide those questions.
	
	
	Every party in litigation is entitled to a fair opportunity to present his or her case. And it seems to me, despite the best endeavours of this Court to attempt to provide an expeditious hearing, which are important to the plaintiffs, in the circumstances which have transpired, as I have detailed them, effectively forcing them on today would deny them that fair opportunity.
	
	
	In the circumstances I am persuaded that the interests of justice require me to adjourn the hearing of these summonses.
	


FURTHER LEGAL ARGUMENT – SEE TRANSCRIPT


	
	Mr Smith of counsel, argues that the adjournment should not exceed an adjournment over the weekend until Monday. His main purpose in making that submission is to attempt to preserve the five days that have been set aside in the Local Court; or at least as many of them as can be. It is obvious if the case is listed here on Monday, nothing can happen then at Burwood Local Court.
	
	
	To that end he has argued that the plaintiffs will have the weekend to pour over the transcripts. I can dispense with any requirement that they file written submissions and hear their arguments orally on Monday. Attractive as that proposition is to me, I have been persuaded by the plaintiffs that it would be unfair to them. I think weight has to be given, as I have said already, to the consideration that they are both self‑represented and that their circumstances are that they have access to limited resources only in custody. Although I did remark in the course of argument that Mr Woods’ document prepared earlier in these proceedings seems to have referred, not only to the most pertinent authorities but also to the most pertinent passages from those authorities in relation to his argument concerning apprehended bias.
	
	
	I am conscious of the fact that Mr Smith of counsel has worked very hard to produce a coherent written submission over the few days available since this matter was fixed earlier this week. Being self‑represented is not a privilege; it is a misfortune or a disadvantage. However, even recognising that consideration, I think courts have to accept that self‑represented people will take longer to produce useful documents than trained lawyers. Given that so much litigation is conducted these days with the benefit of written submissions and as both Mr Woods and Mr Fantakis have asked for the opportunity to prepare written submissions, I think it would be unfair to them to deny them that opportunity.
	
	
	Accordingly, I propose to make some directions concerning the filing of written submissions by the parties.
	
	
	My orders are:
	



	
	The hearing is adjourned.
	
	
	Mr Woods, the Plaintiff in Matter No 2016/10749, is to file and serve his written submissions by 22 April 2016.
	
	
	Mr Fantakis, the Plaintiff in Matters No 2016/14432 and 2016/36676 is to file and serve his written submissions by 29 April 2016.
	
	
	The First Defendant in the matter is to file and serve its written submissions by 7 May 2016.
	
	
	The Second Defendant is to file and serve its written submission by 7 May 2016.
	
	
	List the matter for directions before the Common Law Case Management Registrar at 9.00am on 10 May 2016.
	
	
	Direct the Registrar to issue orders for the appearance of the Plaintiffs by audio video link on 10 May 2016.

2701810,R v IL [2016] NSWCCA 51,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 4 January 2013, there was a fire in a house in Ryde. The fire was almost completely contained in the bathroom where a gas cylinder was connected by a pipe or hose to a ring burner. On the ring burner there was a cooking pot containing a liquid substance which, on the Crown case, was methylamphetamine or a substance proposed to be made into methamphetamine. On top of the cooking pot was a burning mattress. At the time of the fire, the respondent was present in the house with Mr Zhi Min Lan. Mr Lan was severely burned and later died of his injuries.

On 18 November 2014, the respondent was arraigned in the Supreme Court on an indictment that contained six counts. The first count charged her with manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The second count charged her with the murder of Mr Lan or alternatively, the manslaughter of Mr Lan. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth counts charged the respondent with the unauthorised possession of various firearms. The respondent pleaded not guilty to all 6 counts.

At trial, the Crown relied on the category of murder known as constructive murder. The Crown could not and did not seek to nominate any specific act or event which caused the ignition of the ring burner. The Crown therefore relied on the principles of joint criminal enterprise. The Crown alleged that the respondent was engaged, with Mr Lan, in a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Under s 33(3)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug is punishable by imprisonment for life and therefore is capable of being a foundational crime for constructive murder. The Crown argued that because the respondent and Mr Lan were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, the respondent was equally responsible for the act of ignition.

In relation to the manslaughter charge, the Crown relied on involuntary manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown case on manslaughter also depended on the principles of joint criminal enterprise. The Crown alleged that the act causing death (the ignition of the ring burner) was both unlawful and dangerous.

At the close of the Crown case, the trial judge directed the jury to return verdicts of not guilty in respect of the charges of murder and manslaughter. The jury duly did so. The trial proceeded on the remaining counts and on 9 December 2014, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each of the remaining counts.

Pursuant to s 107(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 (NSW), the Crown appealed against the directed verdict of acquittal of the respondent on the murder and manslaughter counts.

On appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge erred by not applying the correct test when determining that there was no prima facie case of constructive murder. Additionally, the Crown argued that the trial judge did not apply the correct test when determining that there was no prima facie case of involuntary manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act.

In response, the respondent contended that the Court lacked jurisdiction to determine the appeal because the grounds of appeal did not raise questions of law alone. The respondent also raised an argument against an order for a new trial on the count of murder. The respondent relied on the terms of s 18(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and submitted that on no view of the meaning of “malicious” could it be said that the act that caused Mr Lan’s death was malicious.

Held

Simpson JA (RA Hulme J and Bellew J agreeing) allowing the appeal and quashing the acquittal of the respondent on the murder and manslaughter charges:

(1)   Both grounds of appeal identified a question of law alone: [59]

(2)   In relation to the murder charge, it was not necessary to show that the respondent contemplated injury to or the death of Mr Lan. The principles of joint criminal enterprise were applicable to the foundational crime of drug manufacture. The relevant question was therefore whether the ignition of the ring burner was within the scope of that enterprise, or contemplated by the participants: [60], [61], [62], [63], [64].

R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 considered;

McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 considered;

R v Dermirian [1989] VR 97; 33 A Crim R 441 distinguished.

(3)   In relation to the manslaughter charge, it was not necessary to show that the respondent and Mr Lan acted together in lighting the burner. All that was necessary to show was that the ignition or lighting of the burner was an incident within the contemplation of the respondent in her participation in the commission of the drug manufacturing offence: [70]

(4)   (a)  Whether “malicious” in s 18(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is to be interpreted in light of the now repealed s 5 or absent that light, it would be open to a jury to conclude that the act causing death, the ignition or lighting of the ring burner was malicious: [92], [93], [95], [98]-[104].

(b)  Although the definition of “maliciously” initially contained in s 5 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was repealed with effect from 27 September 2008 (Crimes Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Sch 1, cl 2) its effect in relation to charges of murder is preserved by Sch 11, cl 65.

Judgment


	
	SIMPSON JA: On 18 November 2014 the respondent was arraigned in the Supreme Court on an indictment that contained six counts. The first count charged her with manufacturing a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine). The second count charged her with the murder and, alternatively, the manslaughter, of Zhi Min Lan. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth counts charged unauthorised possession of various firearms or weapons.
	
	
	A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. With respect to the count of murder, the Crown case was that the act causing death was done in the course of the commission, or attempted commission, of the drug manufacturing offence – the basis of murder that has come to be known as “constructive murder” and will be explained and discussed below. The manslaughter count was similarly based.
	
	
	On 2 December 2014 the trial judge directed the jury to return verdicts of not guilty on the murder and manslaughter counts, which the jury duly did. The trial proceeded on the remaining counts. On 9 December 2014 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on each of those counts.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions (“the Director”) now appeals, pursuant to s 107(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”), against the acquittal of the respondent on the murder and manslaughter counts. Section 107(2) permits the Director (or the Attorney General) to appeal against (inter alia) the acquittal of a person by a jury at the direction of the trial judge.  Such an appeal is confined to grounds that involve “question[s] of law alone”.
	
	
	Section 111(1)(b) of the Appeal and Review Act imposes a prohibition on publication of any matter that identifies an acquitted person the subject of a s 107(2) appeal, unless publication is authorised by an order of this Court (or, in the event of a retrial, the court of trial). No such order has been sought or made. The respondent will therefore be referred to by a pseudonym.
	
	
	The issues raised by the appeal involve consideration of certain principles of law with respect to the offences of murder and manslaughter and of offences committed in the pursuit of a joint criminal enterprise. Some difficult questions arise. The response made on behalf of the respondent calls for consideration of an even more difficult question, the proper construction of s 18(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and the effect (if any) of the repeal (in 2008) of s 5 of the same Act (which, when in force, defined “maliciously”).
	


Background


	
	It is necessary to identify the case the Crown sought to make at trial. Obviously, what follows ought not be taken as representing any findings of fact; the facts as stated are those asserted by the Crown in the evidence in the trial, drawn largely from an uncontentious Summary of Trial prepared on behalf of the Director.
	
	
	All offences were alleged to have been committed in January 2013. The Crown alleged that the respondent and Mr Lan were jointly engaged in a criminal enterprise of the unlawful manufacture of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine in a house in Ryde. Part of the manufacture took place in a bathroom in the house. Early in the morning of 4 January there was a fire in the house, almost completely contained in the bathroom, where a gas cylinder was connected by a pipe or hose to a ring burner. The central knob of the ring burner was slightly to the left of the “off” position. The valve of the gas cylinder to which the ring burner was connected was loose, and appeared to be partially open. On the ring burner was a cooking pot containing a liquid substance which, on the Crown case, was methylamphetamine or a substance proposed to be made into methylamphetamine. On top of the cooking pot was a burning mattress. Also in the bathroom was a pistol-shaped cigarette lighter. The respondent was present in the house, as was Mr Lan, who was naked and severely burned. The respondent attempted to prevent police officers opening the front door of the house.
	
	
	Mr Lan was taken by ambulance to hospital, where he died on 14 January. The medical cause of death was severe hypoxic brain injury caused by smoke inhalation, or burn wounds (causes of death given variously by different medical practitioners).
	
	
	The only evidence of the cause of the fire was that given by Detective Sergeant Agius, of the Forensic Services Group of the NSW Police Force. Detective Sergeant Agius was not able to say with certainty that, prior to the fire, the ring burner was lit. That the valve of the gas cylinder was loose indicated that gas could escape from the ring without it being ignited. However, ignition in those circumstances without human intervention would be very uncommon.
	
	
	Detective Sergeant Agius was not able to determine the cause of the fire. That was, in part, because of the introduction of the mattress, which he assumed to have been brought in, after the fire had begun, with a view to stifling or smothering, or at least impeding the spread of, the flames. Although he was unable to determine the process that started the fire, he canvassed several possibilities. These included (but were not limited to):
	



	
	heat from the gas ring igniting an object (on the assumption that the gas ring had been ignited);
	
	
	ignition of vapours by the gas ring (again, on the assumption that the gas ring had been ignited);
	
	
	ignition of vapours with the cigarette lighter;
	
	
	ignition of vapours by a spark caused by an electric fan or by a spark from the light switch.
	


Detective Sergeant Agius considered that there was a less than 5 per cent chance that the last of these explained the fire. There was no evidence that the cause was an explosion of vapours or gas. Although Detective Sergeant Agius acknowledged that there was no observable evidence that the ring burner was alight prior to the fire, it is a clear inference from the opinions he expressed, and from all of the circumstances, that that was the case. I will proceed on the basis that the ring burner was ignited, and that either the first or the second of the alternatives above was the cause of the fire, and that the ignition was the result of some human act. The act of igniting the gas ring was therefore the act that ultimately caused Mr Lan’s death. It is of some significance (as will later appear) that this was the act upon which the Crown relied, for the purposes of the counts of murder and manslaughter as the act causing death. The Crown was not able to say, with any degree of certainty, who had actually done the act that ignited the burner. It was a fair – indeed, virtually inevitable – inference that it was either the respondent or Mr Lan. But that was as far as the Crown was able to go in fixing the actual responsibility for the ignition on one or the other of the participants in the criminal venture. There was, importantly, no evidence on which it could be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the act of igniting the ring burner was that of the respondent. Indeed, having regard to his injuries, it is more likely that it was Mr Lan who took the step that caused the ring burner to ignite. It is appropriate to signal here that the inability of the Crown to prove that it was the respondent who ignited the burner is of fundamental importance to the Crown case on murder and manslaughter, and to the issues in this appeal. If the Crown could prove that the act of ignition was done by the respondent, the case against her would be a relatively simple one of constructive murder, or of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. The significance of the Crown’s inability to prove that critical fact will be discussed below.


	
	Expert evidence was given in the Crown case of the process of manufacture used in the premises. It is not necessary to go into the detail. It is sufficient to say that the process involved dissolving, in acetone and over heat, a substance containing a low level of methylamphetamine, for the purpose of extracting the methylamphetamine. Acetone is a flammable solvent. Heating flammable solvents generates flammable vapours which expand to fill a space. Once the concentration of vapours reaches an ignitable level it can explode if initiated by ignition. A combustible gas mixture, such as acetone in the air, can be ignited by a spark from electrical appliances, or by naked flames. The concentration of vapour depends, in part, on the space available; hence, an ignitable concentration is likely to be reached more quickly in a smaller space. In the experience of the expert, explosions or fires in clandestine methylamphetamine laboratories are usually caused during the evaporation of a flammable solvent.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to detail the evidence that implicated the respondent in the drug manufacturing enterprise, or the firearms possession, which resulted in her conviction on those charges.
	


The appeal


	
	To explain how the Crown case on appeal was put, it is necessary to begin by mentioning some legal principles, statutory and common law.
	


Murder


	
	Section 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) defines murder as follows:
	


“18  Murder and manslaughter defined

(1)  

(a)  Murder shall be taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, or thing by him or her omitted to be done, causing the death charged, was done or omitted with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm upon some person, or done in an attempt to commit, or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years.

(b)  Every other punishable homicide shall be taken to be manslaughter.

(2)  

(a)  No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.

(b)  No punishment or forfeiture shall be incurred by any person who kills another by misfortune only.”


	
	There are, therefore, in s 18(1)(a), four categories of murder. Three of the categories are defined by reference to the state of mind of the accused person at the time of the act or omission that causes death: that is, murder is committed when the act (or omission) causing death was done (or omitted):
	


(i)  with reckless indifference to human life;

(ii)  with intent to kill;

(iii)  with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm,

For the purposes of this case, those three categories of murder can be put to one side.


	
	The fourth category is different. An act that causes death is held to be murder when the act (or omission) is done (or omitted) by the accused or an accomplice of the accused, in the course of the commission or attempted commission, or immediately after the commission, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years. This is an offence formerly known as “felony murder”, more commonly now known as “constructive murder”. In cases of felony murder or constructive murder it is usual to refer to the crime in relation to which the death occurred as “the foundational crime”. I will adopt this terminology.
	


Manslaughter


	
	Two categories of manslaughter are recognised by the criminal law: voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter: Wilson v The Queen [1992] HCA 31; 174 CLR 313; Lavender v The Queen [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67; Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317.
	
	
	Voluntary manslaughter plays no part in the present matter. It can be put to one side. Involuntary manslaughter, in turn, is of two kinds – manslaughter by criminal negligence, and manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. It is the second of these upon which the Crown relies. In order to qualify as an unlawful and dangerous act for the purposes of this category of manslaughter, it is necessary that the act causing death be:
	



	
	unlawful – that is criminally unlawful; and
	
	
	dangerous, in the sense that, objectively, it carries with it an appreciable risk of serious injury.
	


Whether an act causing death is dangerous in the requisite sense, as explained in Wilson, for the purposes of this category of manslaughter, is a question to be determined by the jury. Whether the act asserted by the Crown as the act causing death is unlawful in the requisite sense is, of course, a matter for direction by the trial judge.

Joint criminal enterprise


	
	The law of criminal complicity has its complexities, which, in Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265 the High Court was invited (but declined) “to sweep away” ([27]). For present purposes, the relevant principles were stated in Johns (TS) v The Queen [1980] HCA 3; 143 CLR 108 and restated in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108, and adopted in Likiardopoulos.
	
	
	The statements of principle in Johns are succinct. Barwick CJ said:
	


“… The participants in a common design are liable for all acts done by any of them in the execution of the design which can be held fairly to fall within the ambit of the common design. In deciding upon the extent of that ambit, all those contingencies which can be held to have been in the contemplation of the participants, or which in the circumstances ought necessarily to have been in such contemplation, will fall within the scope of the common design.”

Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ said:

“The object of the doctrine is to fix with complicity for the crime committed by the perpetrator those persons who encouraged, aided or assisted him, whether they be accessories or principals. Broadly speaking, the doctrine looks to the scope of the common purpose or design as the gravamen of complicity and criminal liability.”


	
	The statement of principle in McAuliffe is as follows:
	


“12  The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime … the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime … If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

13  Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose …” (internal citations omitted)


	
	Those principles were affirmed in Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 and Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 231 ALR 500. The plurality in Clayton (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ) said:
	


“17  A person who does not intend the death of the victim, but does intend to do really serious injury to the victim, will be guilty of murder if the victim dies. If a party to a joint criminal enterprise foresees the possibility that another might be assaulted with intention to kill or cause really serious injury to that person, and, despite that foresight, continues to participate in the venture, the criminal culpability lies in the continued participation in the joint enterprise with the necessary foresight … That the participant does not wish or intend that the victim be killed is of no greater significance than the observation that the person committing the assault need not wish or intend that result, yet be guilty of the crime of murder.” (italics in original, internal citation omitted)


	
	The second quoted paragraph from McAuliffe, and [17] of Clayton state the doctrine known in Australia as “extended joint criminal enterprise” which involves fixing a participant in a joint criminal enterprise with liability for offences committed by one participant that were not within the common intention, where the possibility of such an offence was within the foresight, or contemplation of the other participant (or participants).
	
	
	That doctrine (extended joint criminal enterprise) does not arise for consideration in the present case. An understanding of the principles stated in Johns is sufficient. I mention the extension merely to emphasise that, in this case, there is no allegation of an offence over and beyond that (drug manufacture) being committed by either of the participants.
	


The murder count


	
	It is only the category of murder known as constructive murder that is applicable to the present case. (I have mentioned the other categories in order to explain a distinction to be drawn between certain of the authorities on which reliance was placed both before the primary judge, and before this Court.) The Crown’s allegation that the respondent was engaged, with Mr Lan, in a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, provides the basis for its case that the respondent was guilty of constructive murder. Manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug is a crime that is, by s 33(3)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), punishable by imprisonment for life, and thus capable of being a “foundational crime” for constructive murder. The Crown case on murder was that Mr Lan’s death was caused by an act of the respondent, in the course of the commission, or attempted commission, of an offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. However, as has been noted above, because the Crown was unable to nominate any act or event that caused the ignition of the ring burner, it was unable to nominate any specific act of the respondent that caused Mr Lan’s death. The Crown therefore relied upon principles of law relating to joint criminal enterprise, particularly those with respect to fixing one participant with criminal liability for the acts (or omissions), within the scope of their agreement, of another participant, or other participants. I will return to this.
	
	
	It was, thus, the Crown case that, because the respondent and Mr Lan were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise, the respondent was equally responsible for the act of ignition whichever of the two actually did it; that, in effect, if it were Mr Lan’s act that caused the ignition of the ring burner that act was, on the principles stated in Johns and McAuliffe, the respondent’s act. Since the respondent was thus responsible for the act causing death, and it was an act done in the course of the commission of an offence punishable by imprisonment for life, the respondent was guilty of the murder of Mr Lan.
	


Application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise


	
	The application of the principles of joint criminal enterprise is not limited to prosecutions for murder, although each of the cases mentioned (see [20] above] involved a charge of murder. There is an important point of distinction between those cases, and the present. In each case (Johns, McAuliffe, and Likiardopoulos) the accused person was charged with murder as a direct result of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise, the scope of which included the use of violence that might result in the death of the victim.
	
	
	In Johns, the appellant was charged as an accessory before the fact of murder; he was a party to an agreement, with two others, to an assault and armed robbery of another man. As a consequence of the assault and robbery, the victim was killed. Although he was not present at the time of the infliction of the violence on the victim, his participation in the agreement was sufficient to fix him with criminal liability for “an act contemplated as a possible incident of the originally planned particular venture” (p 131).
	
	
	Similarly, in McAuliffe, the two appellants were parties to an agreement with another man to assault a stranger. Two of the participants were armed, with, respectively, a hammer and a baton or stick. They encountered two men in a beachside park near a cliff and attacked them violently. One of the victims fell over the cliff, and died of injuries he then sustained. The two appellants were held to have been properly convicted of murder on the principles stated. From the facts of the case, and the judgment of the High Court, it is clear that the appellants were held to have been rightly convicted of murder because the infliction of (at least) grievous bodily harm was, in the circumstances, within the contemplation of the appellants.
	
	
	The circumstances in Likiardopoulos were not dissimilar. Likiardopoulos was party to a joint criminal enterprise, with several others, to assault the victim. The assaults took place over two days, and, as a result, the victim died. Likiardopoulos was not shown to have been present throughout. No single act could be identified as the act causing death. Nevertheless, Likiardopoulos was convicted of murder on McAuliffe principles, and the conviction was upheld in the High Court.
	
	
	None of these prosecutions proceeded upon an allegation of constructive murder. Each of those accused was charged with one of the categories of murder that depends upon proof that an act causing death was done with specific intent, either to kill, or to cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. Each was guilty because the act causing death was committed in the course of a joint criminal enterprise in which death or the infliction of grievous bodily harm was taken to be within the scope of the enterprise, or within the contemplation of the perpetrators.
	
	
	In the present case however, the Crown could not realistically proceed on the basis that death or the infliction of grievous bodily harm was within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise of drug manufacturing, nor that either was within the contemplation of the parties to that enterprise, the respondent and Mr Lan. In order to fix the respondent with liability for murder, the Crown was forced to rely on the final category of murder, constructive murder.
	
	
	R v Sharah (1992) 30 NSWLR 292 was a case in which the Crown relied (unnecessarily, in the view of Carruthers J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Smart J agreed) on alternative categories of murder – first, that the death was an incident in the course of the carrying out of a joint criminal enterprise (armed robbery) and therefore within McAuliffe principles; and, second, constructive murder. The Crown case was that Sharah took part with another man in an armed robbery with wounding, in the course of which the victim was killed. In those circumstances, it could readily be conceded that death or the infliction of grievous bodily harm was within the scope of the enterprise, or within the contemplation of the parties to it. However, the Crown also maintained the alternative basis of liability – constructive murder. Armed robbery with wounding was an offence punishable by imprisonment for 25 years, and therefore qualified as a foundational crime for constructive murder.
	
	
	Carruthers J set out the elements it was necessary for the Crown to prove, both for “common purpose murder” and “felony [constructive] murder”. With respect to the latter, his Honour stated the elements as follows:
	


“(i)  that there was a common purpose between the appellant and [the co-offender] in company to rob [another man] whilst [the co-offender] was, to the knowledge of the appellant, armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun;

(ii)  that during the course of the armed robbery [the co-offender] wounded [the other man] and during the course of such armed robbery with wounding or immediately thereafter, [the co-offender] discharged the gun causing the death of [the victim];

(iii)  that the discharge of the gun by [the co-offender] during or immediately after the armed robbery with wounding of [the other man], was a contingency which the appellant had in mind, whether or not the gun was fired intentionally and whether or not in furtherance of the common unlawful purpose.”


	
	It may be (and has been) questioned whether the third element was necessary, when regard is had to s 18 of the Crimes Act. In Batcheldor v R; Walsh v R [2014] NSWCCA 252, R A Hulme J (with whom Bathurst CJ expressly agreed) considered that the third element (foresight of the discharge of the gun) was an unnecessary importation into the offence of constructive murder. Foresight is an element of the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise, and necessary to render a participant in the joint criminal enterprise liable for acts of other participants; it had not previously been a requirement of constructive murder under s 18 (Batcheldor, at [128]-[132]).
	
	
	However, Sharah has never been overruled and, accordingly, remains a binding authority (on trial judges) for NSW. (It also remains a binding authority for this Court, unless the Court is satisfied that the decision was plainly wrong and that there are compelling reasons to depart from the earlier decisions (Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; 254 ALR 504).
	
	
	In this case, the principles stated above relating to joint criminal enterprise have no direct application to the counts of murder or manslaughter. By that I mean this: the respondent was not charged with either murder or manslaughter as a consequence of her participation in a joint criminal enterprise of which one of the contemplated incidents was the death of, or the infliction of grievous bodily harm on, Mr Lan (or somebody else). Rather, the principles are applicable to the foundational crime, drug manufacture. They are relied on by the Crown in order to fix the respondent with liability for the act of ignition of the burner, whichever of the two participants actually did that act.
	
	
	There was no real dispute that the Crown could make out a case that the respondent and Mr Lan were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. There could have been no real dispute that each bore criminal liability for all of the acts of the other that were within the scope of that joint criminal enterprise, or were contemplated by it. Plainly, the act of lighting the ring burner was such an act. Whichever of the respondent and Mr Lan did that act, the other was equally liable for it.
	
	
	It would be erroneous, however, to go on to say that, because the Crown could not establish that Mr Lan’s death was within the scope of the criminal enterprise of drug manufacturing, or within the contemplation of the participants in that enterprise, the respondent was not liable for conviction for that death. That is because the relevance of the principles stops at the point at which the respondent can be held liable for ignition of the ring burner, whether the specific act of ignition was committed by herself or by Mr Lan. It is the ignition of the burner (not Mr Lan’s death) that has to be shown to be within the scope of the criminal enterprise. There could be no dispute that it was. If it is shown that either the respondent or Mr Lan did the act that ignited the burner, and if it can further be shown that it was the ignition of the burner that caused the fire that, in turn, caused Mr Lan’s death, then the respondent can be convicted of murder.
	
	
	It would be necessary to direct the jury that, to convict the respondent of murder, they would have to be satisfied:
	



	
	that the respondent and Mr Lan were participants in a joint criminal enterprise to manufacture a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug;
	
	
	that it was within the scope of that agreement, or was contemplated by the participants, that the ring burner would be ignited;
	
	
	that the ring burner was in fact ignited;
	
	
	that, as a result of the ignition of the ring burner, the fire began;
	
	
	that Mr Lan’s death was caused by the fire.
	



	
	If all of those matters were proved, the act causing death was done either in an attempt to commit, or during the commission, by the respondent or her accomplice (Mr Lan), of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life.
	


The approach taken by the trial judge


	
	The trial judge reviewed the principles relevant to constructive murder and criminal complicity. Specifically, he noted the elements of constructive murder (felony murder) stated by Carruthers J in Sharah, and also the questions raised about the third of those elements by R A Hulme J in Batcheldor. As to those, he said:
	


“42  Taking the prosecution case at its highest, there is no evidence capable of supporting an inference that the [respondent] contemplated the possibility that somebody might be injured, let alone that they might die, in the course of the manufacturing process.”

He went on, however, immediately to say that that was not determinative.


	
	The trial judge went on to say:
	


“73  None of the evidence is capable of establishing that the fire or explosion was a deliberate act on the part of either [Mr Lan] or [the respondent]. The evidence of their respective injuries suggests that it was [Mr Lan], rather than [the respondent], who committed the act or omission that led to the fire …

74  There is nothing in the evidence that would allow an inference to be drawn that the fire was deliberately set. It was, on any rational view of the evidence, a misadventure caused by incompetence or carelessness on the part of [Mr Lan] and/or [the respondent].”

After referring to the passage in McAuliffe in which it was stated that if one or other or both of the parties do ‘all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime’ they are all equally guilty of the crime. His Honour said:

“80  In this case, the crime of which [the respondent] is alleged to be guilty is the crime of murder. It cannot be said that [Mr Lan] did all those things necessary to constitute that crime in accordance with the agreement.

81  The Crown eschews reliance on what was described in Clayton v The Queen [[2006] HCA 58; 168 A Crim R 174; 81 ALJR 439] (at [14] and [20]) as ‘extended common purpose’ (which makes the parties to the agreement liable for ‘any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose’ (McAuliffe at 114). The Crown says that it is unnecessary to rely on that principle because the act of lighting the burner was an act done in furtherance of the agreement to manufacture drugs. In any event, for extended common purpose to apply, it is necessary to establish ‘foresight of the possibility’ that the other party would act with the requisite intent to commit the crime (in this case murder or manslaughter) said to be within the scope of the common purpose. That is clearly not this case.

82  I accept the submission of [counsel for the respondent] that the criminal liability of [the respondent] is derivative. Properly analysed, if [the respondent] is liable for murder, she is liable as a principal in the second degree. That is, she was present at the scene and (allegedly) ‘aiding and abetting’ the commission of the crime (of manufacture). [Mr Lan] could not be convicted of his own murder …

83  The situation may be different if an innocent third party had been killed. Central to my decision is the fact that the victim (deceased) is the person who committed the act leading to death. He cannot be guilty of his own murder and thus the derivative liability of [the respondent] cannot be established.

…

85  I do not accept that the combination of principles of common purpose and constructive murder work together to make [the respondent] liable to conviction for murder in the circumstances of the present case. Whether the situation may be different where the deceased person was not the one who committed the act or where the death was of an innocent victim is not necessarily to decide in the circumstances of this case.”

The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal were pleaded as follows:
	


“Ground 1: The learned trial Judge erred by not applying the correct test when determining that there was no prima facie case of constructive murder on count 2a [the murder count] by –

deciding that the criminal liability of the respondent was derivative in a constructive murder charge.

finding that the accused was a principal in the second degree to the large commercial manufacturing charge, and that as a result of the derivative liability, she could not be guilty of constructive murder of the deceased who was the principal in the first degree to the large commercial manufacturing offence.

holding that it cannot be said that the deceased did all those things necessary to constitute the crime of murder.

Ground 2:  The learned trial Judge erred by not applying the correct test when determining that there was no prima facie case of manslaughter on count 2b [the manslaughter count] by holding that –

there was no evidence to suggest that the Respondent and the Deceased were acting together in lighting the burner.

the evidence was not capable of excluding the possibility that it was the act of the Deceased that caused his own death.”

Jurisdiction

Question of law alone?


	
	As mentioned above, by s 107(2) of the Appeal and Review Act, an appeal against an acquittal by direction lies only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.
	
	
	On behalf of the respondent it was contended that the grounds pleaded do not raise question[s] of law alone. If that is the case, the appeal is incompetent and this Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with it. It is for this reason that I have set out above the precise terms of the grounds pleaded.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the respondent raised a number of points in support of her contention. First, she referred to the decision of this Court in R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108, in which Spigelman CJ pointed out that the formulation “a question of law alone” is more restrictive than the formulation (found in some other statutes) “question of law”, and also held that a notice of appeal should identify with some precision the “question of law alone” said to be involved in the appeal. She submitted that the notice of appeal in this case also fails to comply with the requirement of specificity.
	
	
	In my opinion, neither criticism can be sustained. There are two grounds of appeal, each quite specific, identifying asserted errors of law in the approach taken by the trial judge, and, in each case, asserting failure to apply the correct test to the question whether there was a prima facie case of the relevant offence (murder or manslaughter), and specifying the respects in which the approach taken by the trial judge was erroneous.
	
	
	Identification of the correct test to be applied to the determination of an issue such as the existence (or otherwise) of a prima facie case in a criminal proceeding, like the construction of a statute (as in JS) involves a question of law alone. The first proposition advanced on behalf of the respondent must be rejected.
	
	
	Next, senior counsel argued that no error in a question of law has been identified. In written submissions, she called in aid the asserted lack of specificity (which I have already rejected) and argued that:
	


“The absence of sufficient particularisation in the notice is … symptomatic of the incapacity of these grounds to come within the restrictive terms of s 107(2) of [the Appeal and Review Act].”

This, she acknowledged, does not raise a jurisdictional issue, but, rather, exposed the absence of any identification of error in a question of law. For reasons to be given below, that should be rejected.


	
	Whether error of law has been established is, of course, a different question. A notice of appeal may plainly identify a statement of law upon which the trial judge acted, without succeeding in establishing that that statement was erroneous.
	
	
	The next proposition was that:
	


“It is antithetical to the requisite precision … and the need for identification of the legal proposition at the heart of each ground … to suggest that there might be found multiple questions of law in a single ground.”


	
	This, presumably, was a reference to the three particulars of the error asserted in Ground 1, and two particulars of the error asserted in Ground 2. It appears that the complaint would not have been made had the five separate asserted errors been pleaded as five separate grounds. If that is the proposition, I would reject it as no more than a pleading point. The question is whether either (or both) of the two grounds identifies a question (or questions) of law alone. Paragraphs (a)-(c) of Ground 1, and paragraphs (a) and (b) of Ground 2 specify the basis upon which error of law is asserted – they are, no doubt, included in order to meet the requirement of specificity or particularity.
	
	
	Senior counsel quite properly drew a distinction between articulation and application of the correct test; the former, she accepted, involves a question of law alone; the latter, she contended, a question of mixed fact and law, and therefore outside the appeal permitted by s 107(2).
	
	
	So much may be accepted: see R v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31 (conveniently referred to as “PL (No 2)”) at [37].
	
	
	Examination of the grounds reveals that the complaint made, in each case, concerns the legal principle to be applied. In the case of paragraph (a) of Ground 1, the complaint raises a clear question of law: is criminal liability for constructive murder derivative or direct? (I hold below that it is direct, and that, therefore, the error asserted has been established, but that is immaterial to the jurisdictional question.) In the case of paragraph (b) of Ground 1, the complaint, properly understood, is that the finding that the respondent could not be guilty of constructive murder was a direct result of the incorrect statement of legal principle identified in paragraph (a) of Ground 1. Paragraph (b) of Ground 1 asserts a legally incorrect reasoning process, in part as a result of the error asserted in paragraph (a). Paragraph (c) of Ground 1, properly understood, complains that an irrelevant consideration was taken into account, the irrelevant consideration being that it could not be said that Mr Lan did all those things necessary to constitute the crime of murder. Taking into account any irrelevant considerations is an error or law. Each paragraph of Ground 1 specifies an asserted error of law in the trial judge’s reasoning process.
	
	
	A similar analysis may be applied to Ground 2. Paragraph (a) of Ground 2 is a “no evidence” ground, clearly a question of law alone. Moreover, the fact of which his Honour found there was no evidence was that the respondent and Mr Lan were acting together in lighting the burner. That, too, is an irrelevant consideration, and therefore discloses – if made out – error in law in the approach to the issue. A relevant question would be whether there was evidence that the respondent and Mr Lan were acting together in the drug manufacturing enterprise, and whether the ignition of the burner was an act within the scope of that enterprise. Paragraph (b) of Ground 2 may be treated in the same way as paragraph (c) of Ground 1. It was not to the point – and therefore an irrelevant consideration – that the evidence was not capable of excluding the possibility that Mr Lan did the act that caused his death.
	
	
	In my opinion, each of the two grounds identifies a question of law alone, explicated by the specification of where the asserted error lies, or how it is exposed. This Court has jurisdiction to determine the appeal.
	


The substance of the appeal: has the Crown established error of law?

(i)  murder


	
	Paragraph [42] of the judgment reveals error in the reasoning process. In that paragraph the trial judge misapprehended the third element stated by Carruthers J in Sharah. What was there said to be a necessary element was foresight of the discharge of a gun by the co-offender during the course of the armed robbery. (That was the act that caused death.) Translating that to the facts of the present case, what the third element of Sharah required was foresight of the ignition of the burner.  As I have endeavoured to point out above, the relevant question was not whether the respondent contemplated injury to, or death of, Mr Lan; the relevant question on the issue of joint criminal enterprise was whether the respondent contemplated the possibility that the ring burner would be ignited – that is, was it within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise? If it was, and if the ring burner was ignited by the respondent or Mr Lan, it was an act committed by one or other of the participants within the scope of that enterprise, and was to be treated as the act of both participants; and it was the act that caused death.
	
	
	Paragraphs [80], [83] and [85] of the judgment are indicative of the same error as I have just identified in [42]. In [80] the trial judge applied the test for joint criminal liability taken from McAuliffe, not to the crime (drug manufacture) in which the respondent was alleged to have been a joint participant, but to the crime of murder. The Crown never alleged that the respondent was a party to a joint criminal enterprise that contemplated death or injury. The principles of joint criminal enterprise were applicable to the foundational crime of drug manufacture. To repeat, if the ignition of the burner was within the scope of that enterprise, then the respondent and Mr Lan were both liable for it.
	
	
	In observing (at [83]) that Mr Lan could not be guilty of his own murder, the trial judge was drawing on what he regarded as a “somewhat analogous case”, R v Demirian [1989] VR 97; 33 A Crim R 441. In that case the victim of an alleged offence had been party to a conspiracy with the person accused of his murder to cause an explosion in a consulate in Melbourne. In the course of the execution of the plan, the bomb detonated prematurely, killing one of the conspirators (the victim). The surviving conspirator was charged with murder. Although an appeal was upheld on other grounds, two judges of the Court of Appeal held that, because the victim could not be convicted of his own murder, the accused person could not be guilty as an accessory or principal in the second degree.
	
	
	As I have attempted to indicate, to focus upon whether injury or death was within the scope of the enterprise, or contemplated by the participants, is to deflect attention from the correct question. The correct question is whether the ignition of the ring burner was within that scope or contemplation; if it was, both participants were responsible for it, and liable for its consequences.
	
	
	Moreover, it was incorrect to characterise the Crown’s case against the respondent on murder as “derivative”. The Crown case was that, by reason of her participation in a crime punishable by imprisonment for life, she was directly liable in murder (for a death caused by an act done in an attempt to commit or during the commission of that offence).
	
	
	It was, in my opinion, incorrect for the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal on the count of murder.
	


(ii)  manslaughter


	
	The Crown case on manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act also depended upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise. As set out above, it is necessary that the Crown show that the act causing death was both unlawful (criminal) and dangerous.
	


The act causing death


	
	As stated above, the act causing death was identified, for the purposes of the Crown case, as the ignition (or lighting) of the ring burner in the bathroom. Igniting a ring burner is not, on its face, a criminal act. However, the Crown argued that the ignition of a ring burner in the course of, or for the preparation of, the manufacture of a prohibited drug, is a criminal act. No argument was advanced to contradict that proposition. It is in accord with the conclusion of this Court in R v CLD [2015] NSWCCA 114. The act of ignition in those circumstances was an unlawful act.
	
	
	There was, in the evidence in this case, ample basis for a conclusion that the ignition of a ring burner in a domestic bathroom in the course of illegal drug manufacturing was a dangerous act. The expert evidence concerning the process of manufacture, outlined above, is ample to establish that.
	
	
	The reasons given by the trial judge for directing a verdict of not guilty on the manslaughter count appear to be similar to those given for the directed verdict on the murder count, and are sufficiently contained in two paragraphs of the judgment, as follows:
	


“97  While it is open to the jury in the present case to find that the act of [Mr Lan] was an act in furtherance of the common purpose alleged by the Crown, there is no evidence to suggest that [the respondent] and [Mr Lan] acted together in lighting the burner. The case is not analogous to the situation (not resolved by the High Court [in Burns v The Queen [2012] HCA 35; 246 CLR 334, to which his Honour had earlier referred]) where two drug users inject one another with a dangerous drug.

98  The evidence is not capable of excluding the possibility that it was the act of [Mr Lan] that caused his own death. There is no evidence that [Mr Lan] was not acting voluntarily. There is no evidence that he was other than a fully informed and responsible adult.”

(The last sentence of the extract is a reference to a decision of the House of Lords in R v Kennedy (No 2) [2008] AC 269.)


	
	There is error disclosed in this reasoning. For the purposes of the joint criminal enterprise relied upon by the Crown, it was not necessary for the Crown to show that the respondent and Mr Lan “acted together in lighting the burner”. All that was necessary to show was, as I have indicated above in relation to the murder count, that lighting the burner (by one or other of them) was an incident within the contemplation of the respondent in her participation in the commission of the drug manufacturing offence. It may well have been the act of Mr Lan that caused the ignition of the burner, and, if so, that was an act that caused his own death. But the liability of the respondent alleged by the Crown was not derivative; it was, in effect, co-extensive with that of Mr Lan for all acts he undertook in the course of the drug manufacturing enterprise (just as the liability of Mr Lan for all acts undertaken by the respondent was co-extensive with hers).
	
	
	In my opinion it was erroneous to direct the jury to acquit on the manslaughter charge.
	


Disposition


	
	The orders available to this Court on an appeal under s 107(2) are set out in sub-ss (5) and (6) of the Appeal and Review Act. This Court may affirm or quash the acquittal (sub-s (5)); if it quashes the acquittal, it may order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit (sub-s (6)). The logical consequence of the conclusions that, in respect of the murder and manslaughter counts, a wrong test was applied, resulting in acquittals that were erroneous in law, is an order in each case quashing the acquittal. It will then be necessary to consider whether, pursuant to sub-s (6), to order a new trial.
	
	
	That is a discretionary decision. Senior counsel for the respondent raised an interesting, and novel, argument against an order for a new trial on the count of murder. (The argument does not apply to the count of manslaughter.)
	
	
	The argument depended upon the terms of s 18(2)(a) of the Crimes Act, set out above. To repeat, s 18(2)(a) provides:
	


“(2)

(a) No act or omission which was not malicious, or for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse, shall be within this section.”


	
	The exception for acts or omissions for which the accused had lawful cause or excuse can be put to one side. It has no present application. The central proposition advanced on behalf of the respondent was that, on no view of the meaning of “malicious”, could it be said that the act that caused Mr Lan’s death was malicious. Although it was never clearly articulated, it seems that the consequential proposition advanced was that, since the Crown could not establish that the act that caused Mr Lan’s death was done maliciously, it would be futile for this Court to order a new trial on the count of murder since any such trial would necessarily result in the respondent’s acquittal. If the central proposition is correct, futility of ordering a new trial would be a powerful discretionary reason for declining to do so, and for affirming the acquittal. Alternatively, the argument may have been directed to the proposition that the acquittal on the murder count was justified for a reason other than that given by the trial judge, and therefore should be affirmed. The argument in support of the consequential proposition was raised for the first time in response to the Director’s appeal.
	
	
	The essential proposition advanced on behalf of the respondent, as I understand it, may be reformulated in the following way:
	



	
	to come within s 18(1)(a), the act that causes death must be shown by the Crown to have been done maliciously;
	
	
	there was no evidence that the ignition of the ring burner was done maliciously;
	
	
	accordingly, the Crown is unable to succeed in proving an essential element of its case;
	
	
	the consequence is that (although for a reason other than those given by the trial judge) the acquittal ought to be affirmed;
	


alternatively


	
	if the acquittal at first instance was incorrectly entered because it was given on an erroneous legal basis, this Court should nevertheless decline to order a new trial (on the basis that a new trial would be, at least, a futility, or, at worst, an abuse of process).
	



	
	The argument hinges on the meaning of “maliciously” as it appears in s 18(2)(a). One complicating circumstance immediately emerges. In 1901, when s 18 was enacted (not precisely in its present form, but not different in a way that is material to the present argument), the Crimes Act contained, in s 5, an extended definition of “maliciously”. It could not be said that the definition cast a great deal of light on the question of the meaning of the word, or the concept. Section 5 was in the following terms:
	


“Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient of the crime.”


	
	The drafting of s 5 has been the subject of adverse comment. In Mraz v The Queen [1955] HCA 59; 93 CLR 493 Fullagar J described it (so far as relevant to that case) as:
	


“… a mere question-begging definition, saying no more than that ‘every act done of malice … shall be taken to have been done maliciously’.”


	
	Thirty five years later, in R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467, Hunt J (as he then was) said:
	


“… it should be stated (yet again) that the definition of ‘maliciously’ in s 5 is not a happily drafted one.”

His Honour went on to note the possible meanings that could be assigned to the various alternatives set out in the section.


	
	Section 5, when in force, was of general application. It has been observed that, so far as it related to murder within s 18, s 5 had no operation to any of the categories mentioned above other than the fourth, that is constructive (felony) murder: Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; 172 CLR 378 at 454 per McHugh J; Coleman at 474 per Hunt J.
	
	
	That was because the other categories of murder specified in s 18 were provable by evidence that the accused person had the relevant state of mind – reckless indifference to human life, intent to kill, or intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The necessity to prove the relevant state of mind left no room for proof of a further, alternative or different, state of mind called “malice”.
	
	
	By the Crimes Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), s 5 was omitted from the Crimes Act with effect from 27 September 2008: see Sch 1, cl 2. By the same amending Act, cl 65 was inserted into Sch 11 of the Crimes Act. Schedule 11 deals with “Savings and Transitional Provisions”. Clause 65 provides:
	


“The repeal of section 5 of this Act by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007 does not affect the operation of any provision of this Act (including a repealed provision) that refers to ‘malicious’ or ‘maliciously’ or of any indictment or charge in which malice is by law an ingredient of the crime.”


	
	The repeal of s 5 took place in the context of a general modernisation of provisions of the Crimes Act that had included “malice” as a fault element. From many such provisions (but not including s 18), the words “maliciously” and “malice” were omitted, and either “recklessly” or “intentionally” (or their noun counterparts) substituted. In his second reading speech in support of the proposed repeal, the Attorney General explained the revision as follows:
	


“The bill removes the archaic fault element of ‘maliciously’ from the Crimes Act and replaces it with the more modern fault elements of ‘recklessly’ and ‘intentionally’ where appropriate …”

He read out cl 5 of the Bill and went on:

“Members can imagine the difficulty in explaining this archaic formulation to juries who may be required to determine very serious cases based on this definition. The confusing and outdated nature of the definition has been raised by several judicial officers over a period of 50 years. For example, as long ago as 1955, the Honourable Justice Fullagar of the High Court in Mraz v R (1955) 93 CLR 493 described the definition of malice in the Crimes Act as ‘a mere question-begging definition’. The term ‘recklessly’ which will largely replace ‘maliciously’ is well-known to the criminal law and it is not proposed to codify or define this term at this time.” (New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 26 September 2007 at 2318)

(Notwithstanding that stated intention, less than two months later, the legislation inserted s 4A into the Crimes Act. Section 4A is as follows:

“4A  Recklessness

For the purposes of this Act, if an element of an offence is recklessness, that element may also be established by proof of intention or knowledge.”)


	
	The consequences of the repeal of s 5, without the deletion of the concept of “malicious” from s 18(2)(a), has been regarded as something of a mystery. In Chen v R [2013] NSWCCA 116, at [62] Button J labelled “remarkable” the fact that the concept of malice remained in s 18, after the deletion of the statutory definition. Button J said:
	


“I know of no decision of this Court as to what s 18(2)(a) should now be taken to mean.”

It may be that Button J’s attention was not drawn to Sch 11, cl 65. However, in Batcheldor, Hidden J (who expressly referred to cl 65) endorsed Button J’s observation.


	
	In my opinion, cl 65 is of significance, as I will explain shortly.
	
	
	It was not initially clear whether the respondent’s position was that the repeal of s 5 wrought a change in the proper construction to be attributed to s 18(2)(a), or that “malicious” in that context retained its original meaning even after the repeal. That question was eventually clarified during the course of oral argument, when senior counsel said:
	


“However, what needs to be grappled with in my submission is, what maliciousness means now that s 5 has been repealed.”

I take this to be an assertion that s 18(2)(a), since 2008, has a meaning different from that which it had prior to 2008.


	
	I am unable to accept that proposition. Some meaning must be given to cl 65 of Sch 11, opaque as it might appear to be.
	
	
	In my opinion, the answer is to be found in the Attorney General’s second reading speech. The repeal of s 5 took place in the context of the general (but not complete) excision of “malice” and “maliciously” from the Crimes Act, and their replacement with less “archaic” language. For some reason, “malice” in s 18(2)(a) escaped that scalpel – hence, what I read as the preservation (in cl 65) of s 5 for the specific purpose of s 18(2)(a) (and any other provisions that contained references to “malice” that also escaped the legislative scalpel). If that is correct, “malicious” in s 18(2)(a) is to be read and interpreted as though s 5 had not been repealed.
	
	
	It is then necessary to attempt to understand what “malicious” means in s 18(2)(a), in such light as the definition provided by s 5 casts.
	
	
	As mentioned, Hunt J in Coleman pointed out the various ways in which s 5 might be read. Unwise as it might seem to attempt an analysis or deconstruction of s 5, I see no way to avoid that potentially unrewarding exercise.
	
	
	In my opinion, the purpose of s 5 was to adopt and then extend the ordinary understanding of “malice”. Adoption of the ordinary meaning follows from the use of the word “malice” itself in the opening phrase. The fact that “malice” is twice used in the definition of “maliciously” indicates that it was used, and intended to be understood, in its conventional legal sense. I will return to consider what that conventional sense is. Omitting the subordinate clauses, the section would have read:
	


“Every act done of malice … shall be taken to have been done maliciously …”

This is in accord with what Fullagar J said in Mraz. The concept is then, by the subordinate clauses, extended to acts done:

“… without malice, but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure … in property or otherwise … and … without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly …”,

which acts are also:

“… taken to have been done maliciously …”


	
	It seems to me that the effect of s 5 is to declare that acts done with a variety of states of mind (other than those that come within the ordinary understanding of “malice”) are to be taken to have been done maliciously. Broken up into its component parts, the section begins by stating (tautologically) that:
	


“Every act done of malice … and without lawful cause or excuse … shall be taken to have been done maliciously.”

The section goes on to declare that certain acts done without malice shall nevertheless be taken to have been done maliciously. Those acts are:


	
	acts done with indifference to human life or suffering (and without lawful cause or excuse);
	
	
	acts done with intent to injure either a person or a corporate body (in property or otherwise) (and without lawful cause or excuse) (although it is difficult to see how an act done with intent to injure could be seen as other than malicious);
	
	
	acts done recklessly or wantonly.
	


(cf Coleman, p 472).

Thus, an act that comes within any of those descriptions (but done without malice) is, by s 5, taken to have been done maliciously.


	
	In Coleman, Hunt J explained “recklessness” (at 475) in the following way:
	


“… in statutory offences other than murder, the degree of recklessness required in order to establish that an act was done maliciously was a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done (that is, some physical harm – but not necessarily the degree of harm in fact so done) might be inflicted (that is, may possibly be inflicted) yet he went ahead and acted.” (italics in original; quoted by Beazley JA (as the President then was) in Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93; 81 NSWLR 119 at [68])


	
	These conclusions bring the debate back to the identification of the act relied upon by the Crown as the act causing death. That, it will be remembered (see [11]), was the act of igniting the ring burner. (That, in the circumstances of this case, where that act was an integral, but possibly relatively minor, part of the whole enterprise, might be an oversimplified approach. A more nuanced approach would suggest that Mr Lan’s death was not caused by a single act, but was a result of a series of acts, culminating in the ignition of the burner, the series of acts including all of the acts involved in the preparation for the manufacture, and the manufacture, of the drugs. However, for present purposes, it is necessary to adhere to the manner in which the Crown presented its case in the Supreme Court.)
	
	
	Once the issues are so stated, in my opinion the outcome is clear. At the very least, it would be open to a jury to conclude that the ignition of the ring burner, in the circumstances in which it took place, was done recklessly. (An act done recklessly is expressly within s 5.) It does not appear that s 5 requires the Crown to prove that an act done recklessly (or wantonly) was also done without lawful cause or excuse, as is necessary with respect to the first and second categories of non-malicious acts that are taken to have been done maliciously; but, even if the absence of lawful cause or excuse is a requirement, it is not an issue in the present case, because there can be no suggestion that, in the circumstances, the act was done otherwise than without lawful cause or excuse. In case it is necessary to explain why it would be open to a jury to conclude that that act was done recklessly, reference may be made to some of the circumstances. A plainly dangerous chemical operation was being undertaken, in a confined space, in wholly unsuitable premises, with primitive equipment. That emerges clearly from the expert evidence in the trial.
	
	
	Ironically, perhaps, my conclusion concerning the interpretation of “malicious” in s 18(2)(a) does not depart in any material way from that proposed on behalf of the respondent. In written submissions the following was put:
	


“60.  The respondent submits that with s 5 of the Crimes Act repealed, an act is not malicious within s 18(2) unless it is proved to be intentional or reckless as to consequences: R v Coleman … R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396.

61.  Alternatively, the respondent submits an act is not malicious unless it is an act of serious violence or one which clearly endangers life, in accordance with the common law attribution of malice in felony murder.” (italics added)


	
	It would clearly be open to a jury to conclude that the ignition of the burner was done recklessly (even without the explanation given by s 4A, inserted in 2008).
	
	
	If I am wrong in concluding that cl 65 of Sch 11 preserves, for the purposes of s 18(2)(a), the application of s 5, then a question remains as to the meaning of “malicious” in that subsection, absent the enlightening glow of s 5. “Malicious” then must be given its conventional, legal, meaning. In R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396, it was held:
	


“In any statutory definition of a crime, malice must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general but as requiring either (1) An actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (ie, the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it). It is neither limited to nor does it indeed require any ill will towards the person injured …”

These words were taken from C S Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, (1st ed 1902, Cambridge University Press) (repeated in the 1952 edition), and expressly endorsed by the court. The court summarised by saying:

“In our opinion the word ‘maliciously’ in a statutory crime postulates foresight of consequence.”

In Coleman, it was held that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that foresight was of the probability of consequences; foresight of the possibility was sufficient.


	
	In R v Rushworth (1992) 95 Cr App R 252, it was held that a direction to a jury that a defendant was acting maliciously if he was acting deliberately and was aware that some physical harm might, not would, result was correct.
	
	
	R v Safwan (1986) 8 NSWLR 97 concerned the adequacy of directions given to a jury in respect of the meaning of “maliciously” as the word appeared in s 33 of the Crimes Act as it then stood. Section 33 created various offences of wounding, infliction of grievous bodily harm, shooting or attempting to discharge loaded weapons at any person, in each case done maliciously, and with one of a number of specified intentions. The trial judge directed the jury in terms of s 5. He interpolated an explanation of “malice” by saying “that is, with evil intent …”. This Court (Street CJ, Lee and McInerney JJ) approved the explanation, but considered that the direction could have been simplified by deletion of parts of s 5 not applicable to that case. The direction their Honours preferred was:
	


“… every act done of malice; that is, with evil intent, or with intent to injure some person or persons, and in such case without lawful cause or excuse, shall be taken to have been done maliciously within the meaning of the Act.”


	
	It is apparent that their Honours were construing “malice” as it appeared in s 5, but without the expansionary content of s 5 – in other words, the explanation given to “malice” was an explanation of that word in its conventional, legal, sense.
	
	
	While the words “of evil intent” might now seem dated – even “archaic” – what can be accepted is that the word “malice” and its counterparts are to be given a broad meaning. They are well able to encompass a dangerous act undertaken in the course of an illegal drug manufacturing enterprise in inadequate premises.
	
	
	Accordingly, whether “malicious” in s 18(2)(a) is to be interpreted in the light of s 5, or absent that light, the respondent’s submission must fail.
	
	
	In these circumstances, I have concluded that the respondent has established no discretionary basis for taking either of the courses proposed, either of which would result in the affirmation of the acquittal on the murder charge.
	
	
	The Director also sought an order for a new trial. Although it may not strictly be necessary to do so (since once the acquittals are quashed, the charges have not been disposed of), s 107(6) of the Appeal and Review Act makes specific provision for such a course, and, accordingly, I propose that the Court make such an order.
	
	
	The orders I propose are:
	



	
	The verdict of the Supreme Court of 2 December 2014, pursuant to which the respondent was acquitted of the murder of Zhi Min Lan is quashed.
	
	
	The verdict of the Supreme Court of 2 December 2014, pursuant to which the respondent was acquitted of the manslaughter of Zhi Min Lan is quashed.
	
	
	There be a new trial on the charges of murder and manslaughter.
	



	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson JA. I would only add that I have no doubt about the correctness of her Honour’s primary view that cl 65 of Sch 11 preserves, for the purposes of s 18(2)(a), the application of the repealed s 5. If it were otherwise I am unable to discern to what end that particular provision was inserted into the “Savings and Transitional Provisions” Schedule of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	BELLEW J: I agree with Simpson JA. I also agree with the additional observations of R A Hulme J.

		05 May 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701816,McKinley v R [2016] NSWCCA 53,"Judgment


	
	BASTEN JA: On 23 October 2014 Judge Wilson SC sentenced the applicant for one offence of robbery in company pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The sentence imposed was one of 3 years 10 months to date from 1 March 2014, with a non-parole period of 2 years 10 months. At the same time, the applicant was sentenced for the breach of a number of bonds which appear to have involved nine separate offences. For each she was sentenced to three months imprisonment, to be served concurrently and to date from 30 November 2013. The sentence for robbery therefore commenced the day following the completion of the sentences with respect to the bonds. Given the number of offences involved and the fact that all sentences were to be served concurrently, there could be no error in requiring the full term of three months to be served before commencing the fresh sentence.
	
	
	The only basis of challenge was that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed on her for the robbery with the sentence imposed on her co-offender, Fine Anthony Langi.
	
	
	The applicant’s submissions stated that she was sentenced to 3 years 10 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 7 months: that was not correct; the non-parole period was 2 years 10 months (34 months), with a balance of term of 12 months. That correction is important because the ratio of mandatory custody to the balance of the term reflected the operation of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW); the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being more. The sentencing judge expressly declined to find that there were special circumstances, for reasons which are not challenged. There could, therefore, be no separate complaint based on the length of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The co-offender was sentenced by Cogswell DCJ later than the applicant, namely on 17 November 2014. Mr Langi was sentenced to an aggregate term for the offence of robbery together with breaches of bonds with respect to four offences. Two factors are significant for present purposes. First, the indicative sentence for the robbery in company was specified as 3 years 10 months, being identical with the sentence imposed on the applicant. Secondly, in specifying a non-parole period, Cogswell DCJ found there were special circumstances with respect to the co-offender, thus entitling him to vary the statutory proportion so as to permit a longer period to be served in the community.
	
	
	It is therefore apparent that the only comparable factor is the head sentence for the robbery in company, which was identical for each offender.
	
	
	The applicant sought to avoid this conclusion by calling in aid the approach adopted by this Court in Ruge and Cormack v R [2015] NSWCCA 153. In a judgment delivered by Hamill J (Leeming and Simpson JJA agreeing) the applicant asserted that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to find special circumstances. Hamill J noted at [29] that “the way in which the matter was argued involved the submission that that failure gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when comparison is made with the non-parole component of the sentence later imposed on [a co-offender].”
	
	
	The case turned on its own facts and the arguments raised. The error identified was “an unjustified inconsistency, in the approach to special circumstances taken in the two cases”: at [36]. There was, as a result, a disparity between the respective non-parole periods. Unlike the present case, Ruge involved an explicit challenge to the failure of the judge to find special circumstances; no such challenge was available in the present case.
	
	
	In these circumstances, there is no need to set out the facts involved in the offending, nor the subjective circumstances of the offender. All of the relevant matters were set out by the sentencing judge in her reasons. They demonstrate that the offender played a significantly greater role in the offending. The application is entirely without merit.
	
	
	The application was filed late, but only a few days after the expiration of the last extension granted. That date was 12 months after the sentencing of the co-offender. The judgment in that matter was apparently not received until 24 August 2015. The unwarranted delay was probably about two months, not a long period by some standards, but one of concern as the applicant had, by the time the application was filed, served more than half her non-parole period. Nevertheless, she should have an extension of time, although it will provide no benefit.
	
	
	The Court should make the following orders:
	


With respect to the sentence imposed by Wilson SC DCJ in the District Court at Newcastle on 23 October 2014,

(1)   extend the time for filing the application for leave to appeal to 24 November 2015;

(2)   refuse leave to appeal against sentence.


	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with Basten JA.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Basten JA.

		12 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701817,R v Jenkins [2016] NSWSC 414,"Mr Jenkins is accused of murder. The events which have given rise to the matter occurred on 18 September 2013 at Doonside when he is said to have murdered Cheyne Stuart Duncan by stabbing him.
	
	
	Mr Jenkins has entered a plea of not guilty and on 6 November 2015 the Criminal List Judge, Johnson J set the matter down for a trial to commence on 4 April 2016 with a three-week estimate.
	
	
	The matter was initially allocated to Mathews AJ but at a directions hearing conducted by her Honour on 18 March 2016, it was indicated that Mr Scragg of learned counsel who is briefed, and has been briefed for some time, on behalf of Mr Jenkins, would be unable to appear this week because of prior important professional commitments.
	
	
	At the same time it was indicated to her Honour that the issues that had emerged were such that the estimate may be more like four to five weeks than three and in those circumstances her Honour indicated that she was not available to conduct the trial.
	
	
	The matter was reallocated to me and came before me on 23 March for a directions hearing. At that stage I learnt that the defence had yet to provide its disclosure notice under s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and that the real issues for determination by the jury therefore were still attended by a degree of uncertainty.
	
	
	The significance of that was that until the Crown knew, as it in modern practice is entitled to know, how much of its notified case was in dispute and whether any positive defences were likely to be raised, it was unable to finalise the brief of evidence for the trial.
	
	
	Having regard to the Easter period intervening I directed that the notice under s 143 be provided no later than 30 March 2016. When the notice was provided a number of things became apparent.
	
	
	For reasons that Mr Green has explained relating to, I use his expression neutrally, Mr Jenkins’ mental state, the circumstances leading to the stabbing of the deceased are in issue. The notice also said “the accused concedes there is evidence available to the Crown if accepted by a jury is capable of establishing the accused stabbed the deceased which caused the death of the deceased”. I understand that not to be a denial of the actus reus but rather a statement which puts the Crown to proof of an essential element of the offence.
	
	
	However, importantly the notice stated in para 1(b) that self-defence, mental illness and substantial impairment were issues, and in para 1(g) that substantial impairment was relied upon. By Pt 2 of the notice, the accused served a total of five experts reports from three experts: a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist and a toxicologist/pharmacologist. Those reports range over the period 8 May 2015 to 27 March 2016 (Easter Sunday).
	
	
	When the matter came before me to confirm its readiness to proceed on Monday 4 April 2016, the Crown, I must say with great fairness, indicated that these reports had been received and that they gave rise to a serious triable issue about whether Mr Jenkins was entitled to rely upon the partial defence of substantial impairment in the alternative to the defence already telegraphed of self-defence or defence of another. I was informed by the learned Crown Prosecutor, Mr Herps, that inquiries at that time indicated that the Crown could not put itself in a position to deal with this evidence for some weeks.
	
	
	I should point out the following circumstances. Under Criminal Procedure Regulation 2010 (NSW) cl 20, the defence is required to give notice of reliance on the defence of substantial impairment no later than 35 days before the commencement of the trial. In this case that would have meant that the notice should have been given no later than at the last week of February 2016.
	
	
	Moreover, when the matter was before the Arraignments Judge in September Mr Green, solicitor who represents Mr Jenkins, informed Johnson J that a report had been obtained from Dr Allnutt, being his first report of 8 May 2015, and that further inquiries were being made in relation to the availability of the defence of substantial impairment.
	
	
	For that reason his Honour adjourned the arraignment hearing to 6 November. On that occasion Johnson J raised the question again directly with Mr Green and Mr Green replied that at that stage substantial impairment was not to be relied upon. Now I appreciate the nuanced qualification but I must say, as I have said to Mr Green in the course of the hearing today, that I would have thought that if, as clearly was the case, investigations in relation to that issue were continuing, that should be made clear to his Honour and a further adjournment sought until those inquiries had been completed and the defence were in a position to make a decision about whether to raise those circumstances as an alternative partial defence to the most serious charge that Mr Jenkins is facing.
	
	
	There are a number of reasons why that was necessary. The first and foremost is the lawyer’s duty of complete candour. The second is that the interests of the administration of justice require that trials be ready to proceed when they are set down. Murder trials in the Supreme Court of New South Wales typically take weeks or even months. Once hearing time is allocated to a particular trial it is impossible to call on another trial to replace it if there is to be an adjournment.
	
	
	Now I acknowledge that not infrequently there may be a change of plea and a person who has pleaded not guilty will then plead guilty to the charge and the trial becomes unnecessary. However, in circumstances like this where it has become necessary for the Crown to apply for an adjournment of the trial, the net effect is four to five weeks which the court had available for the conduct of a murder trial is simply wasted. The secondary effect is of course that Mr Jenkins, who is held in custody on remand awaiting his trial, is deprived the opportunity of standing trial at this time.
	
	
	It seems to me that the result of an adjournment will be that a trial date is unlikely to be available in the Common Law Division until at the very earliest late this year or perhaps the first half of next year and that delay is to be greatly deprecated.
	
	
	I return then to the merits of the Crown’s application. In the circumstances the defence do not object, and indeed consent, to the adjournment. This is a proper attitude for the defence to adopt.
	
	
	When the matter was before me on Monday the Crown informed me that inquiries made at that stage indicated that it was likely to be some weeks before the Crown could put itself in a position to meet the new material served out of time by the defence.
	
	
	Anxious as I was to do all that could be done to preserve the hearing dates, even if that meant pushing the commencement date back somewhat, I asked that inquiries be made this week to see how quickly expert witnesses could be qualified to meet the material served by the defence.
	
	
	In support of the application for an adjournment Mr Herps has read the affidavit of his instructing solicitor Ms Britten sworn on 7 April 2016. From it I am satisfied that she has made diligent inquiries to attempt to secure the assistance of relevantly qualified experts to meet this new case.
	
	
	I had hoped, I suppose by way of hope over experience, that perhaps arrangements could be made that would enable the new issues to be met during the running of the lay evidence in the trial but of course the Crown must have the opportunity to investigate these matters for a number of reasons. One, of course, is to determine whether it agrees that Mr Jenkins has available to him the partial defence of substantial impairment. It must also be put in a position where it can meet and test the evidence likely to be led in the defence case. That is to say, learned counsel needs to have the benefit of independent experts qualified by his own instructing solicitor to equip him to test and cross-examine the evidence of the defence experts, always bearing in mind the defence carries the onus of proof on this issue on the balance of probabilities and that the prosecution is entitled to call its evidence relevant to the issue in reply.
	
	
	From Ms Britten’s affidavit I accept that it is likely to be six to eight weeks before the process of gathering relevant expert evidence is complete. I also accept that, given the issue, the number of lay witnesses who have to be called will necessarily increase.
	
	
	It is obvious from my reading of the reports that have been served by the defence that there are at least two competing versions of primary fact relevant to the expressions of opinion by experts in this area and testimony of lay witnesses who saw the accused on 18 September 2013 before, during and in the aftermath of the events that led to the death of Mr Duncan, will be very material.
	
	
	Given the length of time that it will reasonably take the Crown to put itself in a position to meet this new issue and given the necessary extension of the estimate previously given, I have no option other than to accede in the interests of justice to the application made by the Crown today.
	
	
	Accordingly, I make the following orders:
	



	
	The trial of the matter of R v Brandon Jenkins is vacated.
	
	
	List the matter in the Arraignment’s List before Johnson J on 6 May 2016.

2701820,Woods v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) ; Fantakis v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 448,"ex tempore judgment (rEVISED)


	
	For reasons given earlier today, I have adjourned the hearing of these applications for judicial review arising in the context of committal proceedings in the Local Court for the offence of murder.
	
	
	The plaintiffs who are to face committal proceedings commencing on Monday in the Burwood Local Court with a listing of five days have applied for a stay of those proceedings pending the disposition of their applications for judicial review. It had been hoped that this Court could dispose of the applications today and orders were made in that regard on Monday by Wilson J to attempt to give effect to that purpose. For the reasons I have explained earlier, that has not been possible.
	
	
	Generally speaking the power of an appellate court to order a stay of proceedings in lower courts proceeds on the basis of established principles, as Mr Smith of counsel has reminded me. Essentially, although referred to as a stay, such an order amounts to the grant of an interlocutory injunction. Generally to justify a stay of legal proceedings it is necessary for the applicant to demonstrate a fairly arguable case for the relief sought in this Court and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of the stay. When one speaks of the balance of convenience in this context, it is usually necessary to show that the benefit of the remedy sought in the Supreme Court is likely to be rendered nugatory if the stay is not granted.
	
	
	These general principles are not exhaustive statements of the relevant considerations which inform the exercise of this power. Matters such as those referred to by Mr Fantakis like the futility of allowing the proceedings below to continue also have some relevance and may be weighed when assessing where the balance of convenience lies. In truth, the real question is what the interests of justice, and the administration of justice, require.
	
	
	This is a very complicated case. The brief of evidence apparently runs to 50 volumes. It seems clear to me, the plaintiffs and Mr Smith of counsel, that it is very unlikely that the committal proceedings will conclude within the available of five days.
	
	
	The substantive point made by the plaintiffs is that if Mr Fantakis' summons based upon what he asserts is the bias, actual or apprehended, of the learned Magistrate is made good, the whole proceedings will be rendered nugatory and will have to start again involving a great waste of public money. So much may be accepted. Because of the circumstances which have led to the adjournment today, it has not been possible for Mr Fantakis to take me through the material which he relies upon to demonstrate the basis for his claim that the learned Magistrate has, or at least appears to have, materially prejudged these matters. Therefore, I am simply not in a position to make an informed decision about whether the contention is fairly arguable. As that is not a fault that can be laid at Mr Fantakis' feet, given the efforts he has made to obtain the necessary material before the matter came to Court, I am prepared to assume in his favour that his claim in that regard is at least fairly arguable.
	
	
	I turn then to the balance of convenience. It is certainly true that the costs of next week, both the public cost, and the private cost to the parties are likely to be wasted if the plaintiffs win this case. They will equally be wasted if I order a stay of them now. And it seems to me that that consideration is neutral for that reason. Moreover, it is inherent in the process of judicial review that if the case is successful a legal decision already made is set aside and generally speaking the decision has to be made again by the Lower Court, either constituted by the same officer or constituted by another officer if bias is made good.
	
	
	Given that it seems very unlikely that the case will finish next week in the Local Court, and even assuming a fairly arguable case of bias, I am not persuaded that the benefit of any order Mr Fantakis and Mr Woods persuade this Court to grant, will be lost or rendered nugatory. I am of the view that the balance of convenience, given that these are essentially challenges to what are interlocutory determinations made in the committal proceedings - I acknowledge the importance of the case so far as it relies upon bias - favours the committal proceedings continuing.    I repeat, I acknowledge that that may result in a waste of time and money. Should I stay the proceedings now at the same time and the same money will be wasted.
	
	
	I am conscious of the fact that Mr Fantakis has organised a new legal team. And that they are not available to represent him at the committal next week. As I sought to explain in the course of argument that is not a matter relevant to the determination I have to make today. I am not exercising a power to simply adjourn proceedings in the Local Court.
	
	
	For these reasons I am not satisfied that grounds for granting a stay have been made out. And I refuse the application for a stay.

		18 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701821,Khoder Addouj v R [2016] NSWDC 47,"Judgment


	
	Khoder Addouj (the appellant) appeals against conviction entered by her Honour Magistrate Keogh at the Downing Centre Local Court on 30 October 2015. The appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of resisting police in execution of their duty contrary to s. 546C Crimes Act 1900. The appellant was convicted and fined the sum of $600.
	
	
	At about 9.50pm on 22 May 2015 the appellant was observed by police in the vicinity of the Beresford Hotel in Surry Hills where he spoke to another male. He got into a car and drove a short distance. The appellant was stopped by the police in Oxford Street. He was asked to get out of the car and the police searched it. The police located some steroid cream and the appellant was arrested for possession of that item. At that time the appellant was handcuffed. The police called for a caged police vehicle to attend and the appellant was strip searched in the rear of the caged vehicle. In the meantime, the police continued to search the car.
	
	
	In the car the police located the sum of $3,700 in cash. Of that sum, $1,400 of it was in the console of the car and the appellant told the police it was his. That sum was later returned by the police to the appellant. The police located a further $2,300 in cash and a Nokia mobile phone secreted under the dashboard of the car. The appellant told the police that he did not own the car and that he had no knowledge of the origin of the $2,300 in cash or the Nokia mobile phone. He told the police that he owned a Samsung mobile phone. The police noticed the Samsung mobile phone in the possession of the appellant when they stopped him. When he got out of the car after being stopped by the police the Samsung phone remained on the front passenger seat of the vehicle. During the course of the search the police observed that it rang a number of times and that the appellant received multiple text messages.
	
	
	It is unclear from the evidence as to how long the appellant had been detained by the police before he was subjected to the strip search, but he was kept in the caged police vehicle for approximately 30 minutes while the strip search was undertaken.
	
	
	After a further period, Sergeant Wall (the informant) told the appellant that he was seizing the cash and that he was no longer under arrest. The appellant protested and asked the informant for the names of all of the police involved. He was then released from the police vehicle. He retrieved the Samsung mobile phone from the car and unlocked it.
	
	
	The informant asked the appellant to hand over the phone. At the same time, the informant put his hand on the Samsung mobile phone, which was still in the appellant’s hand. The informant also said, “You are still being searched. Hand over the phone”. The appellant moved his hand back causing the informant to lose his balance. Other police came forward and restrained the appellant and they all fell to the ground. The informant forcibly removed the Samsung mobile phone from the appellant’s grip and he was placed under arrest for resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty.
	
	
	The appellant did not put in issue the legality of the search of the car or of his person. The appellant accepted that the police had the power to do so by reference to sections 21 and 36 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (the Act). At the time the appellant’s person was searched he was under arrest and the police also had the power to search him pursuant to sections 23, 23A and 24 of the Act.
	
	
	The only issue in the appeal was whether I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the informant was acting in the execution of his duty when he requested and took hold of the phone without first giving a warning that the appellant was required by law to comply with the request in compliance with section 203(1) of the Act.
	
	
	The prosecution contended that a warning was not required because the appellant had already complied with or was in the process of complying with the direction, requirement or request: section 203(2) of the Act. The appellant’s contention was that the police officers requirement that the appellant be detained for the purpose of a search of the car and his person ended with he was told he was no longer under arrest and could leave.
	


The relevant law


	
	The applicable principles to be applied in determination of the appeal are as follows.
	
	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31];
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22];
	
	
	Whilst the magistrate’s reasons are not part of the certified transcripts referred to in section 18(1), recourse may be had to them since the appellate function could not properly take place without reference to them: Charara [23]-[24];
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	
	
	Section 21 of the Act relevantly provides
	


21   Power to search persons and seize and detain things without warrant


	
	A police officer may, without a warrant, stop, search and detain a person, and anything in the possession of or under the control of the person, if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that any of the following circumstances exists:
	



	
	the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained,
	
	
	the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control anything used or intended to be used in or in connection with the commission of a relevant offence,
	
	
	the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control in a public place a dangerous article that is being or was used in or in connection with the commission of a relevant offence,
	
	
	the person has in his or her possession or under his or her control, in contravention of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, a prohibited plant or a prohibited drug.
	



	
	A police officer may seize and detain:
	



	
	all or part of a thing that the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds is stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained, and
	
	
	all or part of a thing that the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds may provide evidence of the commission of a relevant offence, and
	
	
	any dangerous article, and
	
	
	any prohibited plant or prohibited drug in the possession or under the control of a person in contravention of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985,
	



	
	found as a result of a search under this section.
	
	
	Section 203 of the Act relevantly provides
	


203   Police officers to give warnings when giving or making directions, requirements or requests that must be complied with


	
	A police officer who exercises a power to which this Part applies that consists of a direction, requirement or request must give a warning to the person subject to the exercise of the power that the person is required by law to comply with the direction, requirement or request.
	


Note. A failure to comply with the direction, requirement or request does not constitute an offence unless a warning under this section has been given—see section 204B.


	
	A warning is not required if the person has already complied with or is in the process of complying with the direction, requirement or request.
	
	
	A police officer must comply with this section as soon as is reasonably practicable after the direction, requirement or request is given or made.
	
	
	If 2 or more police officers are exercising a power to which this Part applies, only one officer present is required to comply with this section.
	



	
	The power of entry, search and seizure are an interference with the rights of a person to resist against conduct that would amount to trespass to the person and or a trespass to property.
	
	
	When a power of search is given by statute the exercise of that power must be strictly in compliance with the statutory power and with the clearest of authority: Henderson v O’Connell [1937] VLR 171 at 176 and applied by the Full Federal Court in Noordof v Bartlett (1986) 12 FCR 209 and cited with approval by McHugh J in Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1 at [118]-[120].
	
	
	The requirements in sections 202 and 203 of the Act are conditions of a police officer’s power to search a person both under the Act and at common law: section 201 of the Act.
	
	
	The police do not have a common law right to commit a trespass by continuing their investigations when their statutory power that authorises the commission of a trespass comes to an end: Kuru v State of New South Wales (2008) 236 CLR 1.
	


Material considered on the appeal


	
	Tendered before me were the police statements and the transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court.
	
	
	In the Local Court the police statements were tendered without objection. Only four of the officers were required for cross-examination.
	


Analysis of the magistrate’s reasons


	
	On the relevant issue, the magistrate found that the informant was entitled to hold a reasonable suspicion for the search of the phone. She concluded that the reasonable suspicion had not been extinguished by the search of the car and the appellant’s person.
	
	
	Whilst I would agree with the magistrate’s conclusion on this point that the informant had the proper basis for conducting a further search of the appellant, it does not in my view deal with the argument that was advanced on behalf of the appellant.
	
	
	The question was not did the informant have a proper basis for conducting a further search, but rather did the informant make it clear to the appellant by observing the requirements of sections 203(1) of the Act that he was obliged by law to comply with the request because either that the initial search was continuing or that a new search was being initiated.
	


Consideration


	
	The evidence clearly established that the police detained the appellant for the purpose of searching the car and his person. Those searches took about 1 hour. The appellant was clearly informed after the search of the car commenced that he was under arrest. There was no evidence to suggest that he acted in anyway inconsistently with that. He was subjected to a very lengthy strip search in the rear of a caged police vehicle that was parked in a public street. There was no evidence to suggest that he was other than co-operative in the police undertaking that search. There was evidence that he was angry at the end of that process. That is hardly surprising.
	
	
	The police had clearly delineated up to that point that he was not free to leave. He complied with their requests to search him. At the time his person was searched he was under arrest for possession of the steroid cream.
	
	
	During that extensive period of time the Samsung mobile phone was in the effective possession and control of the police on the front passenger seat of the car. Constable Gordon tried to access the phone but could not because it was locked. The police had the power to request that the appellant give them the PIN code during that period. They had the power to seize the phone and to have it examined.
	
	
	The informant expressly told the appellant that he was no longer under arrest and that he was free to leave. The actions and words of the informant made the situation patently clear. The appellant was no longer under arrest, no longer being detained and the search of his person was over.
	
	
	The informant’s direction to hand over the phone was a new direction requirement or request. The informant could not rely on the appellant’s prior co-operation with the earlier search of his person to excuse his failure to warn the appellant, in reliance on section 203(2) of the Act. The informant was required to make it clear to the appellant that he wanted to further search his person and warn the appellant in terms of section 203(1) to make the new search of his person lawful.
	
	
	The informant’s direction to the appellant to hand over the phone was simultaneous with the informant’s attempt to take the phone from him. That act involved a trespass to the person of the appellant and a trespass to the appellant’s property.
	
	
	I am satisfied that that the informant acted unlawfully by failing to warn the appellant and by committing a trespass to his person and his property and thereby I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the informant was acting in the execution of his duty. The appellant is entitled to be acquitted
	


Orders


	
	Orders I make are as follows:
	



	
	The appeal against conviction is allowed.
	
	
	I set aside the conviction and the penalty imposed by the magistrate.

		11 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701822,SafeWork (NSW) v Romanous Contractors; SafeWork (NSW v John Allen Romanous [2016] NSWDC 48,"Judgment


	
	Romanous Contractors Pty Ltd (Romanous Contractors) has pleaded guilty to an offence that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Wojciech Czyz to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	
	
	John Allen Romanous has pleaded guilty to an offence that as an officer of Romanous Contractors who had a health and safety duty under section 27(1) of the Act, he failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Wojciech Czyz to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $300,000.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts that can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors conducted a business in construction and construction management. At the time of the offence Romanous Contractors was the principal contractor on a multi-storey retail construction being undertaken at 84D Roberts Avenue, Mortdale (the premises). Romanous Developments Pty Ltd (Romanous Developments), the owner and developer, had authorised Romanous Contractors to have responsibility for the control and management of the premises. Romanous Contractors began work at the premises in around May 2012
	
	
	Mr Romanous was the sole director and shareholder of Romanous Contractors and was the Site Manager at the premises. Mr Romanous attended the premises daily and supervised subcontractors engaged by Romanous Contractors.
	
	
	Mr Czyz was a sole trader operating a bricklaying business under the name Wojciech Czyz Bricklaying (WC Bricklaying). Romanous Contractors had engaged Mr Czyz to perform masonry block laying and labouring duties at the premises. Mr Czyz began this work in around May 2012 and reported to Mr Romanous.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors employed approximately 6 workers at the premises and engaged a number of sub-contractors including WC Bricklaying and Quickform Pty Ltd.
	
	
	In around August or September 2012 a concrete slab was poured on the second level of the premises and included a penetration of approximately 1 metre by 1 metre on the north-western side of the slab which was designed to accommodate a smoke vent. The penetration was approximately 5.1metres above the level below. At this time there was formwork in place, however the formwork was removed approximately 1 week prior to the incident occurring, creating a hole under the penetration.
	
	
	On or about 14 September 2012 prior to the formwork beneath the penetration being removed, Mr Romanous instructed Mr Adams to cover the penetration with plywood and bolt it to the concrete slab. Mr Adams covered the penetration with plywood, however did not bolt it to the slab. At some time after 5pm Mr Adams informed Mr Romanous that his tools had been stolen and he was unable to bolt the plywood down. Mr Romanous instructed Mr Adams to nail down the plywood until another drill could be obtained, and Mr Adams responded that he would do so the following morning prior to other workers coming onto the site. Mr Adams had not stripped or covered a penetration prior to the incident.
	
	
	The following morning Mr Adams saw that two timber planks owned by Mr Czyz had been placed underneath the plywood covering the penetration. Mr Adams did not check whether the penetration had been covered securely. Mr Romanous did not check that the plywood had been secured to the slab.
	
	
	At approximately 7am on 20 September 2012 Mr Czyz and a number of bricklayers commenced work at the premises. Mr Romanous arrived at around 7.10-7.15am to inspect the site and instruct workers. Mr Romanous spoke with Mr Czyz at approximately 8am and provided him with instructions before leaving the premises at approximately 8.10am.
	
	
	At approximately 8.25am the bricklayers saw Mr Czyz driving a forklift on the north east corner of the slab. Mr Czyz was then seen by Mr Hanna near the penetration, but disappeared from view shortly after. Mr Hanna went to the area where he had seen Mr Czyz. Mr Hanna observed the penetration to be only partially covered by plywood and Mr Czyz lying directly beneath the penetration on the concrete floor. Mr Hanna called out to other co-workers who went to Mr Czyz to render assistance.
	
	
	Mr Czyz sustained fatal head injuries and died at the scene.
	
	
	At about 11.30am Inspector Sandra McCarthy inspected the premises. Inspector McCarthy observed a plank of wood positioned across the penetration with a piece of plywood resting on top partially covering the penetration. Neither had been nailed down or otherwise secured. A Nissan forklift was seen to be parked approximately 4 metres from the penetration.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors had a Site Safety Management Plan and OHSE Management Plan in place prior to the incident, however these plans did not address the risk of a person falling through an unsecured penetration. There were no other procedures or systems in place to address this risk. There were no procedures in place to record planned or actual control measures for penetrations at the premises.
	
	
	At the time of the incident the National Code of Practice for the Prevention of Falls in General Construction and the WorkCover Code of Practice for Managing the Risk of Falls at Workplaces both provided that holes in floors should be made safe immediately after they are formed and should be guarded with material strong enough to prevent objects or persons falling through.
	
	
	Clause 299 of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (the Regulations) requires that a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) be developed before undertaking high risk construction work. The work being controlled by Romanous Contractors was high risk construction work because it involved a risk of a person falling more than 2 metres: clause 291 of the Regulations. Romanous Contractors did not ensure that a written SWMS was in place for working near unsecured penetrations prior to commencing work at the premises.
	
	
	Prior to commencing work at the premises WC Bricklaying submitted a SWMS for Masonry Works and a Hazard Management Design Risk Assessment. QuickForm submitted a SWMS for Formwork. These documents did not address the risks associated with working near penetrations, or checking that penetrations were securely covered. Romanous Contractors did not have a system in place for reviewing SWMS and risk assessments submitted to it prior to working near penetrations.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors did not inform workers at the premises of the existence of penetrations on the second floor and a number of workers were unaware of the penetrations prior to the incident.
	
	
	Following the incident Romanous Contractors implemented a number of safety measures including among other things;
	



	
	Reinstating false-work frames under the penetration;
	
	
	Bolting a plywood cover over the penetration and installing guardrails around the penetration;
	
	
	Establishing formal hazard reporting;
	
	
	Holding regular toolbox talks;
	
	
	Engaging a safety coordinator; and
	
	
	Having a safety auditor consulted to prepare an audit to report on the safety hazards at the premises.
	


The Offenders’ Evidence


	
	The offenders relied on two affidavits of Allen Romanous sworn 18 March 2015 (the first affidavit) and 15 March 2016 (the second affidavit). Mr Romanous was present in court at the sentence hearing and was cross-examined.
	
	
	Mr Romanous holds a Bachelor of Building and Construction Management from the University of Technology Sydney and has been working in the construction industry since around 1990.
	
	
	In about 1996, Mr Romanous began working for his father’s company Romanous Construction Pty Ltd (Romanous Construction) and continued in that employment until around 2009. During this time Mr Romanous worked on a number of major projects including a large commercial development at Hurstville, as well as apartments and units throughout Sydney. Mr Romanous deposed that by 2009 he was working as a site supervisor/manager on a large project for Romanous Construction and was responsible for managing occupational health and safety issues in this role.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors was established on 1 March 2010 and was licensed to build domestic, industrial and commercial premises in New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Romanous deposed that he had known the deceased for approximately 20 years when the Mortdale project commenced and that they socialised weekly. Mr Romanous gave the deceased responsibility for everything to do with masonry blocks on the premises.
	
	
	Mr Romanous was the health and safety officer on the premises between 1 April 2012 and 30 June 2013.
	
	
	When any sub-contractor came on site for the first time Mr Romanous would carry out a site induction. This site induction would consist of a sit down meeting to discuss site safety issues and procedures, including going through the Site Safety Management Plan. Following the meeting workers would sign a Site Induction Form, the Induction Register and have their white card numbers recorded. Mr Romanous believed that the deceased and his employees were inducted on 11 April 2012.
	
	
	Daily toolbox talks were held by Mr Romanous with all people who would be working at the premises on that day.
	
	
	Mr Romanous deposed that he would identify penetrations, assess the risk presented and identify control measures to address the risk. When a new penetration was created he would direct a worker to cover the penetration, usually with plywood secured by nails.
	
	
	The slab was not originally designed to have penetrations, however the design was modified a few days prior to the concrete pour to include 6 penetrations of approximately 1 metre by 1 metre. The concrete slab was poured on 21 August 2012, and the formwork stayed in place until about 14 September 2012. Removal of the formwork created the penetration.
	
	
	In addition to the steps set out in the Agreed Facts, Mr Romanous deposed that on the morning of 18 September 2012 he instructed Mr Czyz to erect a pedestrian crash barrier around the penetration as it was his belief that a plywood cover would not be sufficiently strong to withstand the weight of the Nissan forklift. The barriers were about 2 metres long, 1 metre high and weighed approximately 1 tonne when filled with water.
	
	
	Mr Romanous deposed that on the morning of the incident he noticed that Mr Czyz had not erected barriers as instructed. At about 7:45 Mr Romanous instructed Mr Czyz to erect a number of barriers on the slab, including around the penetration, and that the forklift was not to be used until those instructions had been complied with.
	
	
	Mr Romanous gave evidence in his affidavit that prior to the incident involving Mr Czyz, there had only been two other minor safety incidents on sites at which he was site manager. There had not been any safety incidents on Romanous Contractors projects or at the premises.
	
	
	Following the incident penetrations were securely covered, sign posted and mesh was used where possible.
	
	
	Mr Romanous deposed that he was devastated by the death of Mr Czyz. Mr Romanous said in his affidavit that he is still close to the family of Mr Czyz and assisted them in organising Mr Czyz’s business affairs following his death. Mr Romanous offered the family financial assistance, however this offer was declined. Mr Romanous spent the first anniversary of Mr Czyz’s death with his family and went to the cemetery with colleagues on the second anniversary.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors has not taken on any new work since completing the Project. Mr Romanous deposed that he has been suffering anxiety and depression since shortly after the death of Mr Czyz and has sought help from his GP in this respect.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors has ceased trading. Mr Romanous deposed that he had no intention to return to work in the construction industry in the near future and was not in any form of paid employment in 2013, causing him to encounter financial difficulties.
	
	
	In his 15 March 2016 affidavit Mr Romanous deposed that he is still unable to carry out full-time work responsibilities, but does work 1 day per week for Siesta Inn Pty Ltd (Siesta Inn) and holds shares in that company. Mr Romanous is living with family and has credit card debt of approximately $34,812.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors currently owes the Australian Taxation Office $30,824.
	
	
	Romanous Construction has lent money to Mr Romanous to pay for legal fees in these proceedings and is currently owed $70,685.
	


Factual issues


	
	The parties disagreed on a number of factual issues that were outside the Statement of Agreed Facts. In order for me to take these matters into account on sentence the prosecution must prove any fact that is adverse to the interests of the offender beyond reasonable doubt and the offender must prove any fact favourable to the offender on the balance of probabilities: R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27].
	


The Mesh Issue


	
	One method of eliminating the risk posed by the penetration was to embed mesh into the formwork before pouring the concrete. The result being that when the formwork was removed, a person could not fall through the penetration. The mesh is removed at a later time when the ducting is installed through the penetration. After this point the penetration must be sealed with a plywood cover, because the mesh cannot be reinstated once removed.
	
	
	Mr Romanous deposed that it was not reasonably practicable to install mesh in the penetration because it had anchor points on it to enable the stressing of steel cables laid in the concrete after it was poured. A process known as post-tensioning.
	
	
	The Prosecution tendered an expert report of Christopher Turner dated 4 March 2016. Mr Turner was present in court at the sentencing hearing and was cross-examined. In his report Mr Turner noted that while eliminating the risk of falling through a penetration by the installation of mesh is preferable, it is often not reasonably practicable, including where it is intended to carry out post-tensioning. Mr Turner did not visit the site and was reliant on analysing a few photos taken by an Inspector. He agreed that it was possible that the marks on the opening of one side of the penetration could have been consistent with where post-tensioning anchors had been. He also agreed that covering the penetration with plywood that was secured to the concrete would have complied with both Codes to eliminate the risk.
	
	
	I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was reasonably practicable to use mesh in order to eliminate the risk of falling through a penetration. The penetrations had only been incorporated into the plan a few days before the slab was poured which may not have allowed a sufficient amount of time for mesh to be obtained. The mesh was always going to have to be removed in order for ducting to be installed which would then create the risk of falling through the penetration in the future. The installation of a plywood cover that was properly secured would have eliminated the risk or minimised it so that it was present for a very short time.
	


Prior Safety Incidents


	
	The prosecution led evidence to rebut the evidence of Mr Romanous in [181] of his first affidavit that there had been only two other minor safety related incidents on the sites where he had previously worked as site manager. [1]  Those incidents resulted in one worker sustaining a broken jaw and another suffering a broken ankle.
	
	
	The Prosecution tendered a Statement of Inspector Stephen Cooper dated 5 August 2015. Inspector Cooper was cross-examined before me on 16 March 2016.
	
	
	Inspector Cooper’s Statement was prepared in relation to visits made by Inspector Cooper to 9 The Avenue, Hurstville (the Hurstville site) between 17 October 2006 and 30 April 2007. The principal contractor of the site was Romanous Construction and Mr Romanous identified himself to Inspector Cooper as the construction manager. Inspector Cooper noted multiple floor penetrations and voids with no fall protection, gaps between scaffolding and the building, and unprotected stair landings.
	
	
	Inspector Cooper issued Prohibition and Improvement notices to Romanous Construction regarding the fall hazards identified. These notices were served on Mr Romanous. These notices were not immediately complied with. Further notices were issued on subsequent visits which were also not immediately complied with. Inspector Cooper was required to make a number of visits to the Hurstville site during which he would speak with Mr Romanous about fall hazards and the need to provide a safe system of work.
	
	
	The Prosecution also tendered a Statement of Inspector Phillip May dated 4 August 2015. Inspector May was cross-examined before me on 16 March 2016.
	
	
	Inspector May visited the Hurstville site on a number of occasions between 20 December 2006 and 9 February 2007. On his 20 December 2006 visit, Inspector May noted inadequate fall and edge protection around voids, and a lack of edge protection in a number of areas. Inspector May issued a number of Improvement Notices which were served upon Mr Romanous. These notices were not immediately complied with. Further notices were issued during subsequent visits which were also not immediately complied with.
	
	
	The Prosecution tendered a Statement of Mr Romanous dated 21 January 2009 which was prepared in relation to a potential claim of a worker on the Hurstville site against Romanous Constructions for an injury sustained whilst working at the Hurstville site. In this statement Mr Romanous stated that he would randomly check that penetrations had been securely covered to ensure the safety of employees.
	
	
	The evidence led in [181] of the first affidavit is relevant to whether Mr Romanous was a person of good character. Mr Romanous sought to prove that he was a person of good character because he had in the past demonstrated himself to be a professional and safe site manager. This was a matter to be taken into account pursuant to section 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The prosecution was entitled to call evidence to rebut the evidence led by the offender.
	
	
	I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Romanus has established that he is entitled to have the lack of “safety incidents” taken into account as a mitigating factor in the present sentencing exercise for the following reasons.
	
	
	First his description of “2 minor safety incidents” is apt to mislead. In both instances a worker suffered injury. Safety cannot be ensured when a risk to safety is present. Safety incidents often occur without the infliction of injury to a worker. Second, the evidence led by the prosecution details Mr Romanous’ prior contact with the prosecutor where safety of the workers for whom he was responsible was actually put at risk in a similar fashion to the incident the subject of these proceedings. The evidence demonstrates that risk to safety of a similar nature to the subject matter of these proceedings has been present more often when he was a site manager than he stated in [181] of his first affidavit.
	
	
	By reference to the fact that he has no prior convictions Mr Romanous is generally considered to be a person of good character and will be entitled to a reduction in sentence by reference to that, but not otherwise.
	


Mr Romanous’ credit


	
	The prosecution challenged the veracity of Mr Romanous’ evidence.
	
	
	In response to a request from two Inspectors, on two separate occasions, after the incident, Mr Romanous produced an ‘OHSE Management Plan’ of Romanous Contractors dated 27 February 2012 relating to the work at the site. The document identified an employee, John Mouyat, as the safety officer for the site.
	
	
	Mr Mouyat was called to give evidence on 16 March 2016 and was cross-examined. He gave evidence that he was not appointed the safety officer for the site until 20 September 2012. He told the Inspectors investigating the incident about that in a record of interview that took place on 20 November 2012. Before he was appointed it was his understanding that there was no safety officer appointed.
	
	
	In cross-examination Mr Romanous was asked if the OHSE Management Plan was created after the incident. He denied that proposition. He stated that the reference to Mr Mouyat as safety officer in the document was incorrect. He stated that it may have been intended at the time of preparation of the document that Mr Mouyat would take that role but for some reason he was not appointed until later. He gave evidence that he filled that role in February 2012, until when Mr Mouyat was appointed.
	
	
	It was submitted by the prosecution that I should find that Mr Romanous was not telling the truth on this issue. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he gave false evidence on this point.
	
	
	The prosecution submitted that I should not accept Mr Romanous’ evidence about the directions he gave to Mr Czyz on the day of the incident. The prosecution did not put to Mr Romanous in cross-examination either that he did not give the alleged directions to Mr Czyz or that what he deposed to about giving those directions was untrue. Whilst it is trite to say that this type of evidence should be carefully scrutinised [2] , because what the deceased was told cannot be tested, the prosecution did not give the opportunity to Mr Romanous to respond in cross-examination and therefore to reject his evidence on the point would be substantially unfair to him.
	


Consideration

Objective Seriousness


	
	The proportionality principle requires that a sentence should neither exceed nor be less that the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472, 485-6, 490-1 and 496. At common law, the term “objective circumstances” was used to describe the circumstances of the crime. The gravity of the offence was assessed by reference to its objective seriousness: R v McNaughton (2006) NSWLR 566 at [15].
	
	
	The task requires the court to consider where in the range of conduct covered by the offence the conduct of the offender falls: Baumer v R (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. This assessment will generally indicate the appropriate range of sentences available which will reflect the objective seriousness of the offence committed, and set the limits within which a sentence proportional to the criminality of the offender will lie: BW v R [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [70].
	
	
	The sentencing judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly regarded as circumstances of aggravation or mitigation: R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].
	
	
	The existence of a reasonably foreseeable risk to safety that is likely to result in serious injury or death is a factor relevant to the gravity of the offence: Capral Aluminium Limited v Workcover Authority of New South Wales (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [89]. The question of foreseeability of the risk is to be determined objectively.
	
	
	The actions of Mr Romanous were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence committed by him and the offence committed by Romanous Contractors.
	
	
	The risk presented by an unprotected penetration was obvious. Mr Romanous took some inadequate steps to have the penetration sealed by Mr Adams. After Mr Adams’ initial effort, Mr Romanous knew that the penetration was not adequately secured.
	
	
	Mr Romanous had actual knowledge from his prior interactions with the prosecutor about the danger presented by unguarded penetrations and the steps that should be taken to eliminate or minimise the risk of falling through an unguarded penetration. Mr Romanous demonstrated his awareness of the risks posed by unguarded penetrations in his 21 January 2009 statement and his prior behaviour of checking that penetrations had been properly secured in order to minimise the risk.
	
	
	There were very simple measures available to minimise the risk, and these measures were known by Mr Romanous. Had Mr Romanous checked that the plywood had been secured by Mr Adams, he would have discovered that the penetration was not adequately guarded and remedial action could have been taken.
	
	
	The death of Mr Czyz is a matter relevant to the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	Romanous Constractors failed to develop a written SWMS to identify the risk and implement control measures. The Project involved high risk construction work and a written SWMS was required by clause 299 of the Work Health and Safety Regulations 2011. The system adopted by the offenders was ad hoc, unplanned and wholly inadequate.
	
	
	On any given day 15 to 20 people may be working at the site, and at least 4 other people were working on the slab on the date of the incident. At least 4 workers were exposed to the risk.
	
	
	The risk was present on site for approximately one week.
	
	
	The conduct of the offenders fell well short of that expected from responsible persons involved in high risk constriction activity.
	
	
	The offences fall slightly above the middle range of objective seriousness.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is some need for specific deterrence in this case. The offenders have not accepted responsibility for their failings that led to Mr Czyz’s death. It is likely that Romanous Contractors will be wound up at the conclusion of these proceedings and will not operate a business involving high risk construction activity in the future. It is possible that Mr Romanous will return to building work including high-risk construction activity in the future.
	


Aggravating Factors


	
	The harm caused by the offence was substantial: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Mitigating Factors


	
	Neither Romanous Contractors nor Mr Romanous have any record of prior convictions: section 21A(2)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This factor should be assessed by reference to the fact that Romanous Contractors had only been in operation for approximately 2.5 years at the date of the incident. Mr Romanous was 35 years of age at the date of the incident.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it is no longer trading. It owes money to the ATO and has no income. It is likely to be wound up at the conclusion of theses proceedings.
	
	
	Both offenders entered a plea of guilty: sections 21(3)(k), 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of the plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32].
	
	
	The proceedings against both offenders were commenced by Summons filed on 23 September 2013. The proceedings were first mentioned on 4 November 2013 and were adjourned on 4 separate occasions before being listed for mention on 5 May 2014. On 5 May 2014 Mr Romanous entered a plea of not guilty and his matter was set down for hearing on 18-20 August 2014. Romanous Contactors entered a plea of guilty on that date and its matter was listed to be dealt with following Mr Romanous’ matter.
	
	
	On 18 August 2014 the hearing was vacated and relisted for 23-27 March 2015. On 23 March 2015, the first day of the hearing, Mr Romanous changed his plea to a plea of guilty. A sentence date was fixed for 10 August 2015. That sentence date was vacated on 10 August 2015, an amended summons was filed and the matter was relisted for sentence on 16 March 2016, when the matter came before me.
	
	
	The appropriate discount for Mr Romanous’ plea is 5%.
	
	
	The appropriate discount for Romanous Contractors’ plea is 15%.
	


Capacity to pay a fine


	
	I have had regard to section 6 the Fines Act 1996.
	
	
	The Court is required to have regard to this provision before imposing a fine. Where an offender seeks to have a fine reduced on the basis of a limited capacity to pay, it bears the evidentiary onus of convincing the Court that it should exercise its discretion to limit the amount of the fine. The offender’s capacity to pay is relevant but not decisive: Jahandideh v R [2014] NSWCCA 178 at [16]. A substantial fine may still be warranted as a result of the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	Mr Romanous gave evidence that in March 2015 he was a director of Romanous Contractors and was working managing a hotel run by Siesta Inn. Mr Romanous was a director of Siesta Inn for a period of time and resigned as a director with the intention of going on an overseas holiday for an extended period, although he did not actually do so.
	
	
	Mr Romanous gave evidence that he has not become a director of Siesta Inn again as he is planning on going overseas at the conclusion of these proceedings and will borrow money from family or friends in order to do so.
	
	
	Siesta Inn operates an accommodation venue in Sydney. The evidence does not disclose the hours that Mr Romanus works for Siesta Inn. In the 2014/2015 financial year Mr Romanous earned approximately $26,000 from his employment with Siesta Inn. Mr Romanous gave evidence that he received both cash and electronic payments from Siesta Inn, and that Siesta Inn would pay bills on his behalf from time to time.
	
	
	Mr Romanous had control of, and was a signatory for the bank account of Siesta Inn. Mr Romanous deposed that he occasionally bought things for Siesta Inn on his personal credit card and then reimbursed himself from Siesta Inn’s bank account.
	
	
	Mr Romanous agreed that in August 2012 he had nearly $29 000 in credit card debt and it he accepted that he had always arranged his finances by running his credit card at close to the maximum limit. He agreed that his current credit card debt is not attributable to an inability to work following the incident.
	
	
	Mr Romanous gave evidence that he does not have a written loan agreement with Romanous Construction and that he does not know when he will repay them. He deposed that Romanous Construction will not lend him any more money as they are currently in dispute over a civil case.
	
	
	Mr Romanous gave evidence that there has been no communication with the ATO about the debt owed by Romanous Contractors and that he was unsure how this debt would be paid off.
	
	
	Mr Romanous made a deliberate decision for Romanous Contractors to cease trading and for him not to undertake any work due to these proceedings and the consequences that may flow from them: [204]-[205] of his first affidavit.
	
	
	Mr Romanous states that he has been suffering from anxiety and depression following Mr Czyz’s death and from headaches after falling off a ladder in 2014.
	
	
	The evidence presented on behalf of the offenders as to their respective capacity to pay is seriously inadequate. As a minimum I would have expected the offenders to present a schedule of assets and liabilities and a schedule of income and expenditure, supported by objective documentation ordinarily available to them, including bank statements, tax returns, statements of earnings and the like. I was also unimpressed with the lack of evidence about the financial arrangements relating to the cessation of trading by the company. In my view this is evidence that was reasonably and practicably available to the Court if the offenders had chosen to present it.
	
	
	The offenders have not discharged their evidentiary onus on this issue. The evidence given by Mr Romanous in cross-examination did not assist. He was unable to satisfactorily explain any of the bank statements he was taken to, notwithstanding that he was the person who operated those accounts. His evidence on the financial relationship between the various family companies, how he was paid by those companies and the other support he was provided by his family was evasive. I do not accept Mr Romanous’ evidence on this issue.
	


Victim Impact Statement


	
	The Court received and considered a Victim Impact Statement of the daughter of the deceased, Samantha Czyz. I find that it was appropriate to do so.
	


Penalty


	
	I did not find much of the extensive material presented in Mr Romanous’ first affidavit as particularly mitigating. Mr Romanous did not accept responsibility for his own omissions or the omissions of Romanous Contractors. The explanation shifted the blame to Mr Adams and the deceased. Mr Romanous did not say that he failed to check that the penetration had been secured by Mr Adams as directed. The directions to the deceased had the effect of requiring him and others to work in the vicinity of the risk. The photographic evidence depicted that there were other unsecured penetrations on the site at the time of Inspector McCarthy’s visit shortly after the incident. There was no explanation as to why there was no SWMS. As I have found the conduct of both offenders fell well short of the standard expected of those involved in high risk construction activity.
	
	
	The evidence led by the prosecution rebutted Mr Romanous’ claims that he was a safe and professional site manager.
	
	
	I accept that the death of Mr Czyz has had some psychological effect on Mr Romanous. The evidence is insufficient to allow me to determine how significant that effect has been. For example, there was no medical evidence to support Mr Romanous’ assertion that he was unable to work for medical reasons.
	


Penalty – Romanous Contractors


	
	This is a case that calls for the imposition of a substantial fine as a result of the objective seriousness of the offence, the need for specific and general deterrence and the need for denunciation of the conduct of Romanous Contractors.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $500,000 that will be discounted by 15% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	Romanous Contractors is convicted.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $425,000.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that Romanous Contractors pay the prosecutions costs as agreed or assessed.
	


Penalty – John Allen Romanous


	
	This is a case that calls for the imposition of a substantial fine as a result of the objective seriousness of the offence, the need for specific and general deterrence and the need for denunciation of the conduct of Mr Romanous. It is unlikely that he will have the capacity to pay the fine.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $90,000 that will be discounted by 5% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	John Allen Romanous is convicted.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $85,500.
	
	
	I order pursuant to section 122(2) the Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that John Allen Romanous pay the prosecutions costs as agreed or assessed.

		11 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701824,Parkinson v R [2016] NSWCCA 49,"Judgment


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Button J.
	
	
	BUTTON J: On 12 December 2014, Darren James Parkinson (the applicant) was found guilty by a jury in the District Court of New South Wales at Newcastle of a number of offences of child sexual assault. He was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment by her Honour Judge Syme. There is no application for leave to appeal against that sentence. He has notified and pressed two grounds of appeal against conviction.
	
	
	One of them asserts a misdirection in the summing-up. Because no redirection was sought by defence counsel at trial, reliance upon the ground requires leave, pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW).
	
	
	The other is based upon contentions of fact – namely, that the verdicts are unreasonable and unable to be supported, not only in light of the evidence as a whole, but also in light of a number of verdicts of acquittal that the jury returned at the same time – and therefore also requires a grant of leave.
	
	
	In order to explain the bases of the ground of appeal founded on questions of fact, and my resolution of it, it will be necessary for me to quote from, and to summarise, the evidence in the trial at length.
	


Indictment


	
	On 8 December 2014, the applicant was arraigned before her Honour and a jury panel on an indictment containing the following counts.
	
	
	Count one averred that, between 1 December 2012 and 31 December 2012, the applicant had sexual intercourse (by way of digital/vaginal penetration) with the complainant, a child then aged 13 years (s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).
	
	
	Count two averred that, on or about 12 January 2013, the applicant provided the complainant, a child then under the age of 14 years, with an intoxicating substance with the intention of making it easier for him to procure her for unlawful sexual activity (s 66EB(3) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count three averred that, on or about 12 January 2013, the applicant indecently assaulted the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years (s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count four averred that, on or about 12 January 2013, the applicant incited the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years, to commit an act of indecency upon him (s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count five averred that, on or about 8 March 2013, the applicant had sexual intercourse (by way of digital/vaginal penetration) with the complainant, a child then aged 13 years (s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count six averred that, on or about 8 March 2013, the applicant incited the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years, to commit an act of indecency upon him (s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count seven averred that, on or about 21 April 2013, the applicant had sexual intercourse (by way of digital/vaginal penetration) with the complainant, a child then aged 13 years (s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count eight averred that, on or about 21 April 2013, the applicant indecently assaulted the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years (s 66M(2) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count nine averred that, on or about 29 April 2013, the applicant had sexual intercourse (by way of digital/vaginal penetration) with the complainant, a child then aged 13 years (s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act).
	
	
	Count ten averred that, on or about 29 April 2013, the applicant indecently assaulted the complainant, a person then under the age of 16 years (s 66M(2) of the Crimes Act).

Overview of evidence and trial


	
	Before turning to a detailed analysis of the evidence placed before the jury with regard to each count (including those counts upon which the applicant was acquitted), it is convenient to provide an overview of the evidence.
	
	
	The complainant, aged between 13 and 14 years at the time of the offences, and 15 years at the time of the trial, was the daughter of a woman who was friendly with the female partner of the applicant. Each family had children in the household. The two families socialised together, and on occasion the family of the complainant stayed at the home of the applicant. Indeed, on occasion, the applicant, a man then aged about 50 years, slept on a lounge with the complainant, a girl then aged 13 or 14 years.
	
	
	On Christmas Day 2012, the complainant received an iPod as a Christmas present. Thereafter she made a number of entries in that device that were in the nature of reasonably contemporaneous electronic diary entries. On occasions, she and young friends made entries in the device by way of a “conversation” between the two of them; for example, when they wished to communicate surreptitiously in a classroom, they did so by typing into the device in turn whilst hiding it under a desk.
	
	
	Between January 2013 and April 2013, the complainant made a number of entries in the iPod that strongly suggested on their face that she had had sexual contact with the applicant shortly before the making of each entry.
	
	
	On 3 October 2013, the mother of the complainant discovered the entries on the iPod. She confronted the complainant. The complainant remonstrated with her mother for invading her privacy. On 5 October 2013, the mother of the complainant brought the matter to the attention of the police.
	
	
	On 8 October 2013, the complainant sent a Facebook message to the applicant, which became trial exhibit 3. It strongly suggested that she had deep romantic feelings for him.
	
	
	Thereafter, on three separate occasions, the complainant engaged in recorded interviews with the police: on 11 November 2013; on 25 November 2013; and on 9 January 2014. Those interviews constituted, in due course, the bulk of her examination-in-chief in the trial.
	
	
	At the trial, the complainant gave supplementary oral evidence-in-chief on 8 December 2014, and was thereafter cross-examined by counsel then appearing for the applicant. The case advanced at trial by defence counsel was that the contents of the diary were fantasies, and furthermore that, as a result of a combination of her mental and emotional conditions with prescribed medications, the complainant was prone to hallucinations.
	
	
	Other witnesses gave evidence in the prosecution case, including the mother of the complainant, the partner of the applicant, the police officer in charge of the investigation, and a close friend of the family of the applicant. Still and all, the iPod entries and the evidence of the complainant that they were (to a large although not complete degree) accurate, formed the centrepiece of the Crown case.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the defence case. He denied committing any sexual offence against the complainant. He also raised character by way of leading evidence that he had never been convicted of a crime in his life.
	
	
	To conclude this brief thumbnail sketch, it was accepted by both parties on appeal that there had been a significant misapprehension about the evidence at the time of the trial. In short, a document tendered in the Crown case derived from the digital interrogation of the iPod showed the dates and times at which diary entries had been made. Although it was assumed by both parties at the trial that those times reflected the time in New South Wales, in fact they reflected Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which used to be referred to as Greenwich Mean Time. In other words, although the point was never made to the jury, one needs to add on to the times recorded in the diary a period of something in the order of ten or eleven hours (depending on whether Daylight Saving Time was in operation) to obtain the time in New South Wales.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	The following grounds of appeal were notified and pressed at the hearing:
	


1. The verdicts of guilty on counts 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 15 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence generally and to the verdicts of not guilty on counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 16.

2. In the circumstances of the case the trial judge’s directions as to complaint (Summing up p 16 - 18) were inappropriate and misleading.

The evidence in support of each count


	
	I now provide a detailed summary of what was said by the complainant about each individual count. Generally, I shall recount the statements given in chronological form, quoting (verbatim) first the iPod entry if any; thereafter moving through the three interviews; and concluding with what was said by the complainant in her oral evidence-in-chief and in her cross-examination. I shall also emphasise by italics the portions that are significant to my determinations, for the reasons that I shall explain later in this judgment.
	
	
	It is convenient to group the counts in accordance with whether or not they were said by the complainant to be part of a single incident that included other counts.
	


Count 1 (digital penetration)


	
	This count was not said to be part of an incident that founded other counts.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this count.
	
	
	The complainant made no entry in her iPod in relation to this count.
	
	
	In the first interview, the complainant said the following about this count:

…


	
	There was no evidence with regard to this count in the third interview.
	
	
	The complainant did not say anything about the first count in her oral examination-in-chief.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the complainant was asked about what she had said in the first interview about the first count. In response to a question suggesting the complainant was deliberately evasive in her interview, she replied that she did not “know what comes out of her mouth when I don’t take my medication but I know that this happened” (09/12/14 trial transcript (TT) 64.4 - 64.6).
	
	
	The discrepancy between questions and answers 565 and 566 and question and answer 579 (recorded in the trial transcript as 759) in the first interview was also raised in cross-examination. The complainant maintained that she did not make up the incident (09/12/14 TT 64.35 - 65.4).
	


Count 2 (provision of alcohol to procure sexual activity), Count 3 (indecent assault), and Count 4 (incite act of indecency) 


	
	These counts arose from the one incident that was said to have taken place around 12 January 2013.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the applicant was found guilty of count 3, but not guilty of count 2 and count 4.

Q209   I don't want you to go into detail, I need you to do is tell me what the word wanking means? What did you have to do to him?

A   I don't want to answer it but.

Q210   [34:40] O.K. I know you've typed it all here and I appreciate that but I just need to clarify [name of the complainant], that's all.

A   I don't want to, O.K. I've had enough, I just don't want to talk about it. I want him to get spoken to.

Q211   Yeah.

A   Or he's just going to get away with it.

Q212   Yeah.

A   Well what do you want me to do, God.

Q213   O.K. I guess I just need you to start with talking to me here - - -

A   I don't want to talk any.

Q214   I know you don't want to talk about it and I know how you feel about, you're being used.

A   You don't know how I feel like.

Q215   O.K.

A   O.K.

Q226   That's all right. So I just need you to, I need to know so I can go and talk to him about what the word wanking means, what you think it means and what you have to do to him.

	In the third interview, the complainant said the following about these two counts:
	


…

Q143   Yep. I understand that. That's perfectly fine to get embarrassed, O.K. I understand that. I guess one specific one that I wanted to ask you about is, is a question that I asked you in the second interview and it was talking about a, a note that you typed on the 9th of March, 2013.

A   9th of March.

Q144   Yeah. About the, it says, I'll just read it to you. You typed, ""OMFG,"" -

- -

A   Oh, yeah. I know.

Q144   - - - which standed for oh my fucking God. ""I love [sic] last night because when I was on the lounge - - -

A   Yeah, I know.

Q144   - - - yep, Daz started fingering me. It was so good. Then I was wanking him. Fuck it was good."" And I said to you, ""Can you tell me about that?"" And you said, ""I don't know. I can't remember."" Can you tell me why you - - -

A   I still don't remember what happened then.

Q145   Yep.

A   But I know all that's true because I wouldn't have writ it if it wasn't true.

Q146   Yep.

A   Except for the doggy style. I don't know why I writ that.

Q147   O.K. So it did happen to you?

A   Yeah, it happened to me.

Q148   Can you tell me later, you, you go on to describe to me about, you tell me about him fingering you. You just don't provide me with any, any details about the background of how it happened or the, that actual incident. Is that because you, as you said, or, or, or tell me why you, you couldn't tell me that?

A   About the one on the 9th of March?

Q149   Ah hmm.

A   'Cause I didn't remember.

Q150   [10:30] O.K.

A   Look, I don't remember half, any of that but I know it's true. If it wasn't true I wouldn't have writ it.


	
	These counts were not discussed in any detail in the oral evidence-in-chief or cross-examination of the complainant at the trial.
	


Count 7 (digital penetration) and Count 8 (indecent assault)


	
	These counts arose from the one incident said to have occurred around 21 April 2013.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the applicant was found guilty on both count 7 and count 8.
	
	
	The relevant iPod entries are as follows:
	


Entry: 819:

	The complainant did not say anything about these counts in the first interview.
	
	
	In the second interview, the complainant said the following:
	


…

Q248   [41:29] O.K. All right. So it says here that Daz was fingering you - - -

A   Yeah.

Q250   - - - three times, is that three different incidents during that night or all

at the same time?

A   I don't know.

Q249   Sorry?

A   I don't want to talk about that one.

Q250   O.K. How come?

A   Because I just, the reason I don't want to talk about all this is I get really bad nightmares    I panic a lot, O.K., I get really bad anxiety attacks.

Q251   Yeah.

A   O.K., I don't really want to have one and I don't want to panic.

Q252   O.K.

A   And I don't even want to think about the cunt, I hate him.

Q253   All right. O.K.

A   And I'm not ringing him either, I'm not going to court for this shit.

Q254   O.K.

A   I'm not you maybe think I could have a go at ringing but you don't know, he's not like any other guy, he will just hang up, he'll just tell me to fuck off and hang up.

Q255   O.K.

A   He's not like any other guy, he's got a really bad attitude.

Q256   Yeah.

A   So I'm not ringing him and I'm not going to court for all this shit because it, it's not my fault.

Q257   No, that's right.

A   But it's his.

Q258   [42:48] Yeah.

A   So he can go to court, I'm not going.

Q259   Yeah.

A   I don't want to talk about this shit. I'm over it. I have fucken nightmares every night. I think about it every day. I cry every day.

Q260   Yeah.

A   O.K. So I don't even want to talk about it, especially that one.

Q261   O.K. What's so different about that one?

A   I don't know it's because, I don't know, I just don't want to talk about

that one.

Q262   O.K. Is that because you made a reference to ""Like I was, it was

good and that you were enjoying it and - - -

A   Yes. I was talking to…..

Q263   O.K. All right. And you said it's not your fault?

A   Yeah so why do I have to go to court for it?

Q264   O.K., well we can talk about that after we finish talking today.

A   I'm not ringing him either.

Q265   O.K.

A   He can go get fucked. I hate him.

Q266   O.K. I just, there's another one you've typed up here - - -

A   Can I read it?

Q268   - - - on the 22nd, yeah, it says ""Oh my fucking God, OMFG, I still can't

get over what me and Daz did last night. It was a dream come true, we were like doing doggie style and I was wanking him and he was fingering me. Fuck, it was the best thing ever, like I mean ever but it was awkward when Daz said that this is fun - - -

A   Yeah.

Q268   - - - and like ""Fuck yeah"". So and it finishes with ""and NBSP"" which my understanding of that NBSP is no bullshit please.

A   I didn't write that in any of the notes.

Q267   O.K. Because there's a few of the notes that I notice that it finishes. I understand what fingering is, you've told me about and I don't need you to tell me about that anymore - - -

A   Yeah. And I know what wanking is too.

Q269   - - - and wanking, and I know, yeah.

A   I know what it is

Q268   [44:59] Yeah. And I know what you mean it is now and I don't need to talk about that.

A   So what ok good I don't want to talk about.

Q269   All right. All I need you to do to clarify this one is that you said you were like doing doggie style, tell me about that?

A   Yeah I know, I write things that weren't even true. I haven't been raped by him I promise O.K.

Q270   I ..

A   If I was raped I would have told you.

Q271   There's no mention of the word rape.

A   I know the doggie style, technically rape.

Q272   No, I just need you to tell me, I'm not referring to being raped or

anything like that. I just want you to clarify for me - - -

A   Yeah, well I don't know.

Q274   - - - and you say doing doggie style, what position is that?

A   I don't know, I was retarded back then. I wasn't thinking because I had no brain.

Q273   When you say that it was awkward, but it was awkward?

A   Yeah. It was because he kept on asking me all these questions if it was good or not.

Q274   O.K. Yeah. You told me in the first interview that he never put his penis inside your vagina?

A   No, he didn't.

Q275   He didn't?

A   No.

Q276   O.K. So what was awkward about that? Was it the position that you were, that he was doing stuff to you in or - - -

A   I don't know.

Q277   O.K. So he was fingering your vagina, you've got it was doggie style. So what position is doggie style?

A   I don't, I don't know, O.K., I write things that weren't true.

Q278   [46:32] So is this true or not true?

A   What, the whole thing?

Q279   Yeah.

A   No, the, ah it was true but the doggie style wasn't.

Q280   O.K. All right. So just the doggie style?

A   Yeah.

Q281   Everything else in there, ""I was wanking him and he was fingering me"", that was true?

A   Yes.

A   [Darren’s partner]'s son.

Q52   The truth is it happened three times.

A   Yeah.

…

Q54   All right. Well how about you tell me the last time that you had to - - -

A   Yeah. Um, I don't remember the, I only remember the first time that I was in the room, the playroom thing um, exercise room. I don't remember the second time it happened. I know it happened three times though but the third time it happened was when, I think it was the last time I saw him was in September and um, [Darren’s partner] wasn't home. That was that time. And we slept over.

Q55   Yep. O.K.

A   And um, I went to bed and woke up, he woke me up at 4.00 and yeah, he made me do it.

Q56   O.K. So that's an incident that we've discussed in detail in the first interview.

A   Yeah, but I didn't tell you about that did I? I don't know if I did or not.

Q57   I wasn't aware that, that, that you had - - -

A   Yeah.

Q58   - - - had to suck his penis on that time, you hadn't told me that. So I guess, can you tell me everything that happened in relation to that incident, so just the incident where you had to suck his penis, from beginning to end?

A   How am I supposed to do that….

Q59   O.K., so I guess the second, in the first interview on the 12th of November you talked about, in detail about an incident where it was the very last time that you'd been at Darren's house, Darren and [Darren’s partner]'s house?

A   Yeah.

…

Q61   And you stayed over. Your mum had some alcoholic drinks with Darren.

A   Yeah.

Q62   And you stayed over that night and on two separate occasions he sexually assaulted you.

A   Yep.

Q63   You've just told me now that part of the second incident which was around 4 o'clock in the morning - - -

A   It was the, this whole thing that I had to do to him - - -

Q64   Yep.

embarrassed.

Q67   Yep. That's fine.

A   Oh, I don't know. He, he woke me up at, l went to bed at like 12.00 and he fell asleep next to me and then went into his room. And then he woke me up at, I think 'cause he had to go to work early in the morning - - -

Q68   Ah hmm.

A   - - - and he woke me up before, he woke me up at 4.00 or something. And like, yeah, he was, he woke me up at 4.00 and he was getting ready for work. And I was just laying on the lounge, I was really cold and everything and I went to the toilet and came back, I sat on the lounge for a bit playing my iPod and he came over and like, he came over and then like, he grabbed my head and pulled down his pants and made me do it. And then he heard something and he pulled his pants up and walked out. And then no one was there. And then he did it again for about I think like five minutes. And then he had to quickly go get ready. And then he um, walked over to me and said, ""See you. I've got to go to work."" And went to work.

…

Q79   O.K. So tell me about, you, you used the words that he grabbed your, your head. Or he pulled your pants, he pulled his pants down first?

A   Yeah, he pulled his pants down and then like, grabbed my head.

Q80   [10:20] So when he pulled his pants down what did he use to pull his pants down?

A   Hands.

Q81   O.K. And what could you see when he pulled his pants down?

A   Him taking his pants off.

Q82   Yep. What else could you see when he took his pants off?

A   Penis.

Q83   Yep. And what did his penis look like?

A   How am I supposed to answer that?

Q84   O.K. Well just describe it to me.

A   I don't want to describe a penis. It was just a normal one.

Q85   O.K. So was it hard, soft or something else?

A   I don't remember.

Q86   O.K. So you said that he grabbed your head.

A   Yes.

Q87   Tell me about that.

A   Well he like, grabbed me round there and like - - -

Q88   Yep. So where's there, where are you describing?

A   There, and then pushed - - -

Q89   Yep. What part of your head's that?

A   The back of my head.

Q90   [10:21] Yep.

A   And pushed me forward like, to his penis. And then - - -

Q91   O.K. What did you do then?

A   Well, I didn't know what to do because I couldn't yell out to anyone and I didn't want to tell anyone what happened so I just did it.

Q92   Yep. What did you do?

A   Put my mouth on his penis.

Q93   O.K. And you said that that lasted for about five minutes, is that right?

A   Yeah, the first time he did it like, it happened twice. Like - - -

Q94   Yep.

A   - - - he did it for about two minutes and then he heard something. He thought like, someone was awake so he went down the hallway and checked. And then no one was awake and he came back and did it for about five minutes.

Q95   O.K. So did you hear the noise that he heard?

A   Yeah. It sounded like someone was getting up, but he pulled his pants up quickly and looked in the hallway and then came back.

Q96   O.K. So when he came back what did he do?

A   Did the same thing as the first time.

Q97   O.K. Did he say anything to you?

A   No. He doesn't say anything to me when this happens. I don't think so.

Q98   All right. So when he came back to you what did he do?

A   Did the same thing.

Q99   Yep. What was that?

A   Pulled his pants down, grabbed my head and made me do that.

Q100   [10:23] O.K. And the second time when you say made you do that what did you have to do?

A   Suck his penis.

Q101   O.K. What did you use to suck his penis with?

A   My mouth.

Q102   All right. And you said that that lasted for five minutes.

A   Yeah.

Q103   Yeah. What made it stop?

A   He had to go to work or he would be late.

Q104   O.K. When you were sucking his penis did anything else happen?

A   No. Don't think so.

Q105   O.K. So he stopped because he had to go to work.

A   Yep.

Q106   What happened after that?

A   He went to work.

Q107   O.K.

Q108   So that's the last time you saw him?

A   Yeah, 'cause we had to get up early for some reason. We got, mum woke me up at 7.30.

Q109   Righto. So the time you described an incident where you had to suck his penis in your first interview with me on the 12th of November.

Q112   Yep.

A   I don't remember the second time but I know it happened three times.

…


	
	The complainant did not give any oral evidence-in-chief relevant to this count.
	
	
	In cross-examination, the complainant accepted the (incorrect) proposition that she had made no mention of being made to perform fellatio on the applicant (09/12/14 TT 55.21-55.36). In fact, as I have shown, there is evidence of that nature in the first interview, and counsel asked questions about portions of the first interview dealing with this count in cross-examination.
	
	
	The complainant was asked about the number of times she claimed that the act of fellatio had occurred, in light of the discrepancy between her answers in the first interview, in which the complainant alleged that it occurred 5 or 6 times (09/12/14 TT 65.43-65.49); the second interview, in which the complainant alleged that it occurred only on one occasion (09/12/14 TT 66.1-66.33); and the third interview, in which the complainant alleged that it happened on three occasions (09/12/14 TT 66.35-67.28). In cross-examination the complainant gave evidence that “it did happen three times” (09/12/14 TT 67.36-66.38).
	
	
	The complainant was also asked in cross-examination about the evidence she gave in her first interview as to why she stopped performing oral sex on the applicant, as well as whom and what she saw at that time (09/12/14 TT 70.14-73.10). The focus of the cross-examination was upon her evidence that she had seen another person through a keyhole the diameter of a pen, and heard that person walk past the room.
	


Count 14 (digital penetration), Count 15 (indecent assault), and Count 16 (indecent assault)


	
	These counts arise from the one incident, said to have occurred on or about 29 September 2013.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the applicant was found not guilty of count 14 (digital penetration of the complainant), guilty of count 15 (touching the complainant’s breasts), and not guilty of count 16 (kissing the complainant on the lips).
	
	
	There were no iPod entries in relation to these counts (the complainant received a new iPod on or about 7 June 2013, which was not available at the trial).
	
	
	In the first interview, the complainant said the following:
	


…

Q116   Can you tell me everything that happened from the beginning to the

end?

A   Like that, that night.

…

Q126   Yeah.

A   And it was about 2.00 or 1.00 in the morning Darren woke me up and he, he started touching me around my boobs and all that and like I was really uncomfortable. And like he was really rough, and like I was too scared to say no to him because I thought he would get angry. So I just laid there and then he did it for about half an hour - - -

Q127   [10:29] Yeah.

A   - - - and then he went to bed. He got up and went in his own room to go to bed and then I went straight to sleep. And he woke me up again. He came out and woke me up again 'cause he does, he works at like early, early in the morning.

A   I, I heard someone and then he came up to me, and like I think he like grabbed me or something and I, I woke up, and then he, he said, ""Good morning"", and I was still like half sleep 'cause he only just woke me up. And he was finished getting ready for work and then he started touching me on the boobs and all that.

A   Like he just reached and then he just grabbed my boob like with one hand, and then like he pushed me onto the lounge and then like, he was like got both hands and he was just really rough. And like I didn't know, I didn't know what to say.

…

Q362   O.K. All right. So I just, I'm, I'm a little bit confused and may be that's me. But initially you told me that he woke you up - - - 

A   Yeah.

Q368   - - - and I'm not sure whether we're talking about the same incident here. O.K. 'Cause you said that around 1.00 or 2 o'clock in the morning he woke you up and he started touching me on the boobs. It was really rough. I just laid there and he did it for about half an hour and then you said he got into, he got up and went into his own room and went bed, and I went back to sleep. Then you said he gets up early for work. He woke me up again touching me on the vagina about twenty minutes. He gave me a kiss, then he went and got ready for work. So I just wanted to talk about - - -

A   Yeah I think I was a bit mixed up with the first time - - -

Q363   Yeah.

A   - - - and like 'cause it happened twice in that night.

…

Q366   Lets talk about, lets [sic] talk about the first time then

A   O.K. The first, the first time - - -

Q380   Yeah.

A   - - - and, and yeah I was already awake, and, and then he woke up,

and then he started touching me on the boobs.

…

Q384   [58:34] O.K. So tell me what, how, how he touched you on the boobs?

A   He like, he grabbed me. Like he reached for 'em and then with one hand, and then he got both hands and was doing it rough like, yeah.

…


	
	The complainant did not provide evidence in relation to these counts in either the second or third interview.
	
	
	During cross-examination of the complainant about these counts, the Crown prosecutor conceded that there was no iPod entry relating to them. It was also put to the complainant in cross-examination that what she had said in the third interview about these counts was not consistent with what she said about them in the first interview.
	
	
	That concludes my summary of the evidence specific to each individual count. I now turn to discuss the evidence adduced generally in support of sexual contact between the complainant and the applicant. Again, I shall emphasize by way of italics those portions of the evidence that are significant to my determinations.
	


The evidence with regard to all counts


	
	As I have said, the mother of the complainant gave evidence in the trial about her discovery of the entries on the iPod, and of her subsequent conversations with the complainant. At 10/12/14 TT 12.30-13.20, she said the following:
	


Q. And you said, ""I've been through your iPod and I've seen the notes. You need to tell me the truth. Did he touch you?""

A. Yes.

Q. And she said, ""Yes""?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And you then said, ""Whereabouts did he touch you?""

A. Yes.

Q. And she said, ""Between my legs and my boobs""?

A. Yes, that's correct

Q. You said, ""Did he touch you inside?""

A. Yes.

Q. And she said, ""Yes"". And at that point she lost it.

A. Yep.

Q. She threw a pen at the wall and said, ""How fucking dare you go through my stuff. You were never meant to find out about it.""

A. Yes, that's right, she was very angry at me for reading through her iPod.

Q. And you said that you're glad you did, or, ""I'm glad I did"".

A. Yes.

Q. She said, ""He fucking cares about me.""

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. ""Don't you dare get him into trouble. I will hate you for the rest of my life."" A. Yep. That's exactly what she said.

Q. And she then said, ""Are you going to tell [the partner of the applicant] about this?""

A. Yes.

Q. And you said, ""Yes.""

A. Yep.

Q. She became aggressive, and you didn't want her to hurt herself or property, so you stopped the conversation. 

A. Yeah, it was a very uncomfortable conversation, understandably.


	
	As I have said, part of the Crown case was a Facebook message sent by the complainant to the applicant on 8 October 2013 after the police had become involved. That message read as follows:
	


I miss you daz and I’m so sorry this has happened I guess u know know about what [Darren’s partner] told you I wish I could take back time but…unfortunately I cant (its really hard for me to tell u the truth you are like a dad to me you have made me who I am today I would do anything just to see you one more time I guess I have liked you in a way no one can explain I cant stop thinking about you daz the times we had im sorry I mess things up its you that I seem to think about all the time. Love you so much xox <3 can u message me when you get this Love [complainant] xox


	
	Other evidence relevant to all of the counts was as follows.
	
	
	The complainant’s mother and the complainant herself gave evidence that the complainant had been hospitalised in the Nexus Unit (an inpatient psychiatric unit) at John Hunter Hospital Newcastle on three occasions in 2013.
	
	
	The complainant suffered from a form of depressive disorder, engaged in self-harm, and was prescribed Fluoxetine. It was agreed between the parties at trial that a side effect of that drug can be hallucinations in a very small percentage of patients.
	
	
	As I have shown, in the first interview the complainant spoke of being on medication and writing things on her iPod that did not happen. As well as that, the complainant said in cross-examination that she understood what hallucinations were, and had indeed been suffering from hallucinations (9/12/14 TT 28.11-28.49).
	
	
	It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that her allegations were fantasies, and that she had made up her evidence to the effect that the iPod entries were (generally) true because she did not want to tell her mother the truth; namely, that the entries were untrue. Initially the complainant agreed with this proposition; however clarification by her Honour showed that the complainant did not understand the word “fantasy”, which was an important part of the questioning. Once the word was explained, the complainant denied that the iPod entries were fantasies (9/12/14 TT44-48).
	
	
	Turning to the evidence of the applicant, as I have said he confirmed that he had never been convicted of a crime in his life. He denied all allegations that he had engaged in any behaviour of a sexual nature with the complainant. He also denied that he had ever provided the complainant with alcohol.
	
	
	In cross-examination, he gave evidence that he would sometimes be alone with the complainant (10/12/14 TT40.48-40.50). He was close to her, and sometimes gave her “male advice”: 10/12/14 TT41.15-41.33. He also gave the following evidence (at 10/12/14 TT42.10-42.20):
	


Q. Are there occasions that you would fall asleep on the lounge watching television?

A. Yes.

Q. And was it normal for [complainant] to sleep on the lounge?

A. Yes.

Q. You would wake up and she’d be the only person in the room?

A. Yes, on occasions.

The impugned direction


	
	I now turn to set out the direction that forms the basis of the second ground of appeal. I also set out some of the context, with the precise direction that founds the ground bolded by me:
	


Importantly, the evidence contained in I think it was exhibit 2, the printout from her iPod, the complainant made notes on her iPod at various times and you have heard a lot of evidence as to how and when and where she made that. Clearly, a lot of those notes were made in the early hours of the morning. She told you about her sleeping difficulties. This is, according to the evidence and it is suggested by the Crown and probably not much in dispute, a type of diary entry that people of that age obviously make. They were electronic entries made documenting what she said were important things in her life, as or shortly after things happened.

Now, it is for you to decide what these entries mean. She gave you evidence of what these entries mean, it is for you to decide whether you accept what she said about that. It is for you to decide what weight you give these iPod notes.

In relation to those entries, the Crown suggested that she was embarrassed about them when they were discovered. She was embarrassed and angry with her mother when they were discovered. It is for you to decide, with your knowledge of people and human affairs, whether this is likely to be evidence that you would accept.

The Crown say that the entries support her version of events and the Crown have set out in their written document to you where, in each of the separate charges, the complaint is made in the record of interview and where, if it exists, it is supported by those diary entries.

Now, it is for you to decide what those iPod notes mean, it is for you to decide whether they support the complaints of sexual assault or not. If you find that the notes substantially support the version given by the complainant in her evidence, then you can use that evidence to support what the complainant said in her evidence, that those assaults did occur. That is, you can use the notes as some evidence independent of the evidence given to you about these incidents by the complainant in the witness box.

The law says that because of the circumstance in which the complaint was made, a jury is entitled to use what was said in those complaints, in those notes, if you find them to be complaints, as evidence of the truth of what was said by the complainant in her evidence in the witness box or in those three interviews.

A jury is entitled to find that the complaint was made at the time and the manner that it was made would indicate that the allegation was reliable and the allegation is less likely to have been fabricated by her, more likely to be accurate.

[emphasis added]

Ground two


	
	It is convenient to deal with this ground first.
	
	
	The basis of the ground was explained by senior counsel for the applicant as follows.
	
	
	He did not submit that the iPod entries were inadmissible evidence. Nor did he submit that, if the complainant had said something about a count in her evidence-in-chief (whether by way of one or more of the recorded interviews, or orally before the jury), then that evidence could not be “supported” by an iPod entry, if any, about the same count.
	
	
	But if the evidence-in-chief given by the complainant was nothing more than confirmation that the iPod entry made by the complainant was true and correct, then, senior counsel submitted, it was an error for her Honour to have told the jury that that evidence-in-chief could be bolstered by the iPod entry. That would constitute, he submitted, the form of circular reasoning colloquially known as “bootstrapping”.
	
	
	He submitted that the evidence in support of counts three, five, seven, eight, and ten fell into the category of featuring an iPod entry but no real examination-in-chief, and are therefore affected by the misdirection.
	
	
	In response, the Crown accepted that, if it were the case that the evidence-in-chief founding a count on the indictment was merely confirmation of the correctness of the iPod entry, then the iPod entry could not support the evidence-in-chief. But it was submitted that her Honour had not asked the jury to approach the matter in that way, and the jury would not have understood her Honour as having done so.
	
	
	Separately, it was submitted by the Crown that the particular impugned direction must be read in context. That context included the reference by her Honour in the preceding paragraph to a written document of the Crown, which had been provided to the jury at the trial, and a copy of which was provided to us at the hearing of the appeal. That document provided a summary of the evidence upon which the Crown relied in support of each count. With regard to those counts in which there was an iPod entry, that was set out in its entirety. With regard to those incidents in which there was no iPod entry, a summary of the evidence-in-chief was provided.
	
	
	In other words, the Crown submitted, viewed in the context of the reference made by her Honour (moments before giving the impugned direction) to a document that clearly set out each of the counts, grouped them into incidents, and set out whether there was evidence-in-chief or an iPod entry that formed the basis of the Crown allegation, it could not be the case that the jury somehow used the direction to engage in illogical bootstrapping.
	
	
	Separately, the Crown submitted that the direction, when seen in context, was not erroneous. That is because the direction made clear to the jury that it was only if, with regard to any particular count, there was both an iPod entry and evidence-in-chief that went beyond the iPod entry, that the former could support the latter. In other words, it was said that the jury would not have understood mere confirmation of the correctness of an iPod entry as having been a “version” given by the complainant in her evidence.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, I accept the general proposition of the applicant that a prior representation of a witness cannot be used to corroborate or support subsequent evidence from that witness, if the subsequent evidence is nothing more than an assertion that the prior representation is correct. That would indeed be bootstrapping.
	
	
	Here, however, I do not consider that her Honour was saying anything that had that flavour. Nor do I consider that the jury would have understood her Honour to have been doing so.
	
	
	Seen in context, I consider that the direction was to the effect, and would have been understood by the jury as being to the effect, that, if there were an iPod entry, it could be used to support subsequent substantive evidence from the complainant about an incident. That is my reading of the portion of the direction that reads “you can use the notes as some evidence independent of the evidence given to you about these incidents by the complainant in the witness box”. That is also my reading of the reference by her Honour to the jury being entitled to use the diary entries “as evidence of the truth of what was said by the complainant in her evidence in the witness box or in those three interviews”.
	
	
	Secondly, I consider that the fact that her Honour had, a very short time before, spoken to the jury of the document that set out clearly whether, with regard to each count, the Crown was relying upon an iPod entry, or substantive evidence-in-chief, or both, bolsters my interpretation of what her Honour was saying, and how the jury would have understood it.
	
	
	Thirdly, the fact that defence counsel at trial did not raise any concern about the direction (with the result, as I have said, that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to this ground) supports the proposition that that is how the direction was understood by those who were present in the courtroom. To express that concept another way, if defence counsel had interpreted what her Honour was saying as illogical bootstrapping that was strongly adverse to the applicant with regard to some counts, one would have expected him to have complained about it and sought a re-direction.
	
	
	In short, although I accept the submission made by senior counsel for the applicant as a general proposition, in the particular circumstances of this trial and this summing-up, I do not consider that the impugned direction has occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	For those reasons, I would not grant leave to argue this ground.
	


Ground one


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant explained at the hearing of the appeal that the ground asserting that the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable or unable to be supported has two separate bases. The first is the proposition that the verdicts of guilty are unable to be reconciled rationally with the verdicts of not guilty. The second is the proposition that, when one considers the evidence in the trial in its entirety, each of the verdicts of guilty is unreasonable or unable to be supported.
	
	
	It is convenient to consider each of the bases of this ground separately.
	


Inconsistent verdicts?


	
	Senior counsel submitted that there is no rational basis upon which the jury could have drawn the distinctions it did between the counts and their verdicts. It was said that each of the counts was founded upon the evidence of the one complainant; that there was no evidence emanating from a source other than the complainant that could support the conviction counts but not the acquittal counts; and that there was no other basis upon which the jury could have drawn a distinction between the counts. It was said that, in those circumstances, the convictions founded upon the verdicts of guilty must be quashed.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the applicant invited attention in particular to counts 7 and 9, each of which averred digital/vaginal penetration. Count 7 resulted in a verdict of guilty, and count 9 resulted in a verdict of not guilty. He asked rhetorically: what possible basis was there in the evidence for the jury to draw a distinction, by way of a verdict of guilty and a verdict of not guilty, between those two particular counts?
	
	
	In response, the Crown submitted that there were indeed points of distinction within the evidence, and indeed within the nature of the counts themselves, that permitted the jury to differentiate in the way that it did. That submission was developed by way of a detailed analysis.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this basis of ground one, I accept the validity of the analysis provided by the Crown, and substantially adopt it. To my mind, if one works one’s way carefully through the evidence and the counts, one can see that, although at first blush the submission made on behalf of the applicant is attractive, there was indeed a rational basis for the discernment made by the jury: see generally MacKenzie v the Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348. I proceed to engage in that analysis.
	
	
	It will be recalled that count one, an allegation of digital/vaginal penetration, resulted in a verdict of not guilty. As can be seen from my summary of the evidence above, this count did not feature an iPod entry. That was a basis upon which the jury could draw a sharp and simple distinction with other counts upon which the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	Quite apart from that, my extended extract from the first interview shows that the evidence of the complainant as to whether or not there actually had been penetration of her genitalia was by no means clear. It would not have been surprising if the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been penetration founding this count.
	
	
	Count two was allegedly providing a child with an intoxicating substance in order to procure unlawful sexual activity. It also resulted in a verdict of acquittal. There was a perfectly rational explanation for that verdict.
	
	
	Neither the iPod entries; nor the verbal response of the complainant when her mother discovered those entries; nor the Facebook message, support the proposition that the applicant incited or forced or procured the complainant to engage in sexual contact with him. To the contrary, it was well open to the jury to find that the complainant purported to “consent” to the sexual contact with the applicant; of course, that provided no defence whatsoever to the counts that averred sexual contact with a person under the age of 16 years. But to my mind, the acquittal on count two can readily be explained on the basis that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did anything with intention to “procure” sexual contact between himself and the complainant.
	
	
	Count three was said to have occurred on the same occasion as count two. It alleged aggravated indecent assault, not digital/vaginal penetration. It resulted in a verdict of guilty. It was supported by the iPod entry of 5:11 AM UTC on 14 January 2013. Without recounting it again, the detail of that iPod entry provided a sound basis for the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant touched the complainant on the outside of her vagina.
	
	
	Count four averred that the applicant had incited the complainant to commit a sexual act with him. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty. For the reasons that I have given in my analysis of count two, that verdict of acquittal was quite open in the context of convictions on other counts. On the evidence in the trial, it was quite rational for the jury not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant incited the complainant to engage in sexual contact with him.
	
	
	Count five alleged sexual intercourse by way of digital/vaginal penetration. It was founded on the iPod entry of 11:14 PM UTC on 9 March 2013, which I have extracted above at [57]. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, thereby demonstrating that it had found beyond reasonable doubt that there had indeed been penetration as alleged. I consider that there is force in the submission of the Crown that the complainant, in that entry, provided graphic details about the offence, including her emotional and physiological reaction to penetration. In those circumstances, the verdict of guilty can be rationally distinguished from verdicts of not guilty on other counts, including other counts averring digital/vaginal penetration.
	
	
	Count six alleged that the applicant incited an act of indecency. It resulted in a verdict of not guilty. It required the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had incited the complainant to engage in sexual contact with him. I consider that it is open to the same analysis that I provided with regard to count two and count four. That analysis provides a sound rational basis for the verdict of acquittal in the context of convictions.
	
	
	Count seven alleged sexual intercourse by way of digital/vaginal penetration. It was founded upon the iPod entry of 12:49 PM UTC on 21 April 2013, which I have extracted above at [64]. It was also founded upon what the complainant said in her very first interview with the police; again, I have extracted the relevant portion above. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on count seven.
	
	
	Again, in light of the way that the complainant described in the iPod entry her emotional and physiological reaction to the sexual offence that was being committed against her, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had indeed been penetration to some degree of her genitalia. Furthermore, I consider that the particularity of the iPod entry with regard to this count provides a rational point of distinction with those counts averring digital/vaginal penetration and with regard to which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	Count eight alleged aggravated indecent assault by way of the applicant touching the breasts of the complainant. It was founded upon the same iPod entry, along with what was said in the first interview. It resulted in a verdict of guilty. Because of the structure of the sexual offences in the Crimes Act, any consent to an indecent assault that the complainant may have purported to have given constituted, of course, no defence to the offence, in light of her age. But that was a different matter from the question of the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had incited the complainant with regard to any count, or procured her to commit the act that founded any count.
	
	
	Again, the level of detail and repetition with regard to the offence committed by the applicant provides a rational basis for the distinction drawn by the jury between this count and counts upon which a verdict of not guilty was returned.
	
	
	Count nine averred sexual intercourse by way of digital/vaginal penetration. It was based upon an iPod entry of 12:58 AM on 30 April 2013, which I have extracted above at [71], along with what was said in the first interview. It resulted in a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	I accept the submission of the Crown that the evidence in support of count 7 was more detailed than the evidence in support of count 9. The evidence of the complainant in relation to count 9 did not go beyond her indicating that she was standing up and the applicant started to “finger” her. The complainant was not asked to expand upon or to provide a definition of what such activity involved. I consider that there was a rational basis in the evidence – that is, the particularity of the iPod entries with regard to count seven – that founded the verdict of guilty of counts seven and a verdict of not guilty on count nine.
	
	
	Count 10 averred aggravated indecent assault. It was based upon an iPod entry of 12:56 AM on 30 April 2013, which I have extracted above at [71], along with what was said by the complainant in the first recorded interview. It resulted in a verdict of guilty. That verdict was supported by a detailed electronic diary entry, along with a detailed description in the first complaint made to the police. On that basis, the verdict of guilty is not irrationally inconsistent with any of the verdicts of acquittal.
	
	
	Count 11 averred that the applicant incited the complainant to commit an act of indecency. It was founded upon the same iPod entry, and resulted in a verdict of acquittal. For the reasons that I have explained above with regard to other counts founded upon incitement or procurement, that verdict of acquittal was not inconsistent with other verdicts of guilty.
	
	
	Count 12 alleged that the applicant incited an act of indecency on the part of the complainant. It was derived from the iPod entry of 12:58 AM on 30 April 2013, along with the contents of the first interview. It resulted in a verdict of not guilty. For reasons given previously, the fact that the jury acquitted on a count, an essential element of which was incitement, does not demonstrate any inconsistency with the counts upon which a verdict of guilty was returned.
	
	
	Count 13 averred sexual intercourse between the applicant and the complainant, by way of her performing oral sex upon him. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this count. It was not the subject of any iPod entry at all. It is also the case that, as I have shown in my detailed collation of the evidence in support of this count, the complainant gave inconsistent evidence about how many times she had performed oral sex upon the applicant; I shall not repeat those variations. She also gave at one stage a version that was open to serious question, in that it featured the proposition that she was able to see a person through a keyhole. In light of the absence of a contemporaneous iPod entry, the diverging evidence as to how many times this particular sexual contact had allegedly occurred, and the assertion of being able to see through a keyhole, the verdict of not guilty is not inconsistent with any verdict of guilty returned on other counts.
	
	
	Count 14 alleged sexual intercourse by way of digital/vaginal penetration. That was said to have occurred at about 4:00 AM one morning in September 2013. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on that count. The complainant had made no iPod entry about it, but discussed it in her first interview. In that interview, she had given neither detailed evidence about penetration, nor evidence of her emotional or physiological response to it. That verdict of not guilty is not inconsistent with the verdicts of guilty with regard to other counts averring digital vaginal penetration, or any other verdicts of guilty. That is because those verdicts of guilty are founded either upon iPod entries, or upon graphic descriptions, or other evidence.
	
	
	Count 15 averred an aggravated indecent assault by way of the applicant touching the breasts of the complainant. That was said to be after a motion picture had been watched on television, and both the applicant and the complainant slept on a lounge. It was not founded upon an iPod entry, but rather upon what the complainant had said in her first interview with police. It resulted in a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	It was open to the jury to be satisfied that the applicant touched the complainant on her breasts, whilst at the same time not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had digitally penetrated her, and not being satisfied that the alleged kiss was indecent (that allegation is analysed immediately below).
	
	
	Finally, count 16 averred an aggravated indecent assault, by way of the applicant kissing the complainant on her lips, again in September 2013. It was not the subject of an iPod entry, but had been discussed by the complainant in her first interview. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
	
	
	I consider that that verdict can be rationally explained in a way consistent with the verdicts of guilty on other counts; namely, by way of the jury not being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was contrary to community standards of decency for the applicant to kiss the 14-year-old complainant, who was “consenting” to that conduct, briefly on the lips. That basis of differentiation on the part of the jury is perhaps surprising; nevertheless, I consider that it is a rational one, especially bearing in mind the criminal onus and standard of proof.
	
	
	In short, I consider that a detailed analysis of the counts, the verdicts, and the evidence demonstrates that there was a rational basis for differentiation with regard to each and every verdict of guilty and not guilty. Far from the jury simply disregarding its duty by returning verdicts capriciously or in order to give effect to an irrational compromise, I consider that analysis shows that there were indeed bases for the process of subtle and careful discernment in which I believe the jury engaged. For that reason, I consider that this basis of ground one is not persuasive.
	


Verdicts generally unreasonable?


	
	I turn to consider the second basis of ground one; namely, the submission that the evidence as a whole was so lacking in cogency and persuasiveness that the verdicts of guilty cannot be maintained.
	


Submissions for the applicant


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there were a number of aspects of the evidence that would lead us to regard the verdicts of guilty as unreasonable or unable to be supported, and to quash the convictions. He made it clear that the submission was not dependent upon success with regard to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts. The following aspects of the evidence were emphasised.
	
	
	First, whether one looked to the iPod entries, the Facebook post, the things said to the mother of the complainant, the interviews with police, or the evidence of the complainant in court, the fact is that the Crown case emanated entirely from one person.
	
	
	Secondly, the complainant had suffered from mental and emotional problems sufficient for her to be an inpatient at a psychiatric clinic in a hospital.
	
	
	Thirdly, she had been taking medication which, in a very small percentage of persons, can induce hallucinations.
	
	
	Fourthly, during one interview with the police, she said that “Because I’ve got like a depressive disorder so, I see things”, “And I hear things…”, and “…that’s why I writ stuff [sic]” (IV3 Q&A 126-128).
	
	
	During cross-examination, she seemingly accepted that she suffered from “hallucinations” (9/12/14 TT28.14-28.49).
	
	
	Fifthly, the iPod entries were a significant, if not central part of the Crown case. In those entries, the complainant recorded more than once that the applicant had had penile/vaginal sex with her from behind. There was nothing on its face to distinguish that written claim from the other claims of sexual crimes against the applicant. And yet, when interviewed by police, and when questioned on oath, the complainant firmly maintained the position that that claim was untrue. Furthermore, she was unable to provide any explanation as to why she had recorded something in her iPod diary that she subsequently stated was completely false.
	
	
	Sixthly, the quality of the evidence taken as a whole, and including the evidence with regard to counts upon which there were acquittals returned, was concerning.
	
	
	For example, as I have shown above, the complainant gave very inconsistent evidence as to how many times she had allegedly performed oral sex upon the applicant.
	
	
	Separately, the evidence about the final incident that reflected counts 14, 15 and 16 was confused to the point of being very difficult to follow in terms of timing and circumstances.
	
	
	As well as that, the iPod entry with regard to the presence of the son of the partner of the applicant was said by the complainant to be flatly wrong: her firm position in cross-examination was that that young person was simply not present at any relevant state.
	
	
	With regard to the first count, the complainant told police that after it occurred she had made an iPod entry about it. In fact, there was none.
	
	
	Seventhly, the complainant asserted in her evidence that when the offences occurred she was shocked, frightened, and on occasion frozen with fear. And yet the iPod entries do not suggest that at all; quite the contrary.
	
	
	Eighthly, the applicant gave evidence, subjected himself to cross-examination, and raised character. There was nothing to suggest any previous criminality on his part, and certainly no suggestion of a sexual interest in children.
	
	
	In short it was said that, leaving aside the question of the rational reconciliation of the verdicts of guilty and not guilty, the state of the evidence is such that this Court would come to the view that the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable.
	


Submissions for the Crown


	
	The Crown accepted that the evidence emanates from one person, and that no doubt the jury needed to reflect upon that evidence with great care. It was said, however, that it was ultimately open to the jury to return the verdicts of guilty that it did. The following particular points were made.
	
	
	First, one has to approach criticisms of the quality of the evidence of the complainant with an appreciation that the Crown case was that the complainant was a young girl who had been physically and emotionally taken advantage of by a much older man who was also a family friend. At the time she was mentally and emotionally fragile. On three separate occasions, she was taken in detail by police to entries in her iPod that she had never expected anyone to discover, and that were private details of her sexual contact with another person. After the contents of the diary were revealed, the complainant sent a message to the applicant that strongly suggested that she believed that she had romantic feelings for him, and that she regretted the revelation of what had occurred between them. Many of the criticisms of her evidence (whether given by way of interview or in the witness box) made on behalf of the applicant can be explained by reflection on that context.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown did not put forward on the appeal a hypothesis with regard to the claim made in the iPod of sex from behind said to support the credibility of the complainant. Still and all, it was said that her readiness to admit that it was false bolstered her credibility with regard to the allegations that were maintained.
	
	
	Thirdly, as I have said, the Crown accepted that its case was founded on the evidence of one person. Nevertheless, it invited attention to the undisputed evidence that a middle-aged man would sleep on a lounge whilst a young girl would sleep on a lounge that was, at the least, part of the same lounge suite, whilst his romantic partner was sleeping alone in the same premises.
	
	
	Fourthly, the point was made that the jury was in a position to undertake a collective assessment of the credibility of the complainant and of the applicant. It was said that, even bearing in mind that much (but not all) of the evidence-in-chief of the complainant was recorded, none of her oral evidence-in-chief or her cross-examination or re-examination was available in that form. Nor, of course, was the evidence of the other Crown witnesses, nor the evidence of the applicant. It was said that great weight should be given by us to the assessment of those matters by the jury.
	
	
	Fifthly, in short it was accepted that this Court must make its own assessment of the evidence as a whole. But it was said that we would ultimately find that the verdicts were not unreasonable.
	


Determination


	
	Although it was not the subject of controversy before us, and although the test to be applied is derived from a well-known decision of the High Court of Australia of over two decades ago, I think it appropriate to refer briefly to my understanding of the applicable test.
	
	
	It was most recently reiterated by a plurality of the High Court of Australia in Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29 as follows (in the context of an appeal from a trial by judge alone):
	


[12] Authority makes plain that a jury's finding of guilt is not to be disturbed unless it appears that there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the evidence is all the one way, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or unless there has been a misdirection leading to a miscarriage of justice. It follows perforce of s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act that, in the case of an appeal against a judge's finding of guilt, the finding is not to be disturbed under the first limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act unless there is no or insufficient evidence to support the finding, or the finding is otherwise unreasonable, or the evidence was all the one way, or the judge has so misdirected himself or herself on a matter of law as to result in a miscarriage of justice. It is, however, to be borne steadily in mind that, as with a jury's verdict, so also with the judgment and verdict of a judge alone, in most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which the judge ought to have experienced. To adopt and adapt the language of M v The Queen:

…

Thereafter the High Court of Australia referred to a well-known passage from M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 which is as follows:

[9]…It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence…


	
	Subsequently to the delivery of the judgment in Filippou v The Queen, in Glover v R; Stuart v R [2015] NSWCCA 285, McCallum J considered what was said in M v The Queen about how a Court of Criminal Appeal should approach this ground of appeal. Her Honour reflected on a possible tension between, on the one hand, this Court considering whether the jury must have had a reasonable doubt (in a sense, an error-based appeal), and, on the other hand, members of this Court reflecting upon whether they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of an applicant (in a sense, a de novo appeal).
	
	
	I think it worthwhile to extract the entirety of what her Honour said (without demur on the part of Basten JA, and with the agreement of R A Hulme J) about this question:
	


[97] Glover’s appeal invokes the power of this Court under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to set aside the verdict of a jury if the Court is of the opinion that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. Although the principles to be applied in determining such a ground are well-established, I wish to emphasise an aspect of the relevant jurisprudence which has influenced my conclusion. I am here in part repeating or refining what I said in Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83 at [476] to [480].

[98] It is well-established that, in determining such a ground, this Court must make an “independent assessment of the evidence”. The existence of that function has long been recognised: Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 at 516.1 per Barwick CJ; Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) [1984] HCA 7; 153 CLR 521 at 534 per Gibbs CJ and Mason J; Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 463, 473, 478. It is clear that it is a function which must be discharged carefully, with a view to assessing the “probative value” of the evidence (Morris at 463 per Mason CJ) both as to its sufficiency and its quality (Morris at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ).

[99] It is important to bear in mind the purpose for which that function is performed, which is to determine whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused: Chamberlain at 534.3; Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113] per Hayne J (citing M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 492 to 493). One of the issues considered in the joint judgment in M was whether, in stating the test in such terms, it was necessary to qualify the statement of Barwick CJ in Ratten that the same task could equally be expressed by reference to a doubt entertained by the appellate court itself. The majority in M did not think the difference mattered. It was in that context that the majority said, famously (at 494), “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.”

[100] That quote and the remarks that follow it are frequently cited in this Court as a seminal statement of principle governing appeals of this kind. There is no vice in doing so, provided the passage is read in context. The assertion as to what will be the position “in most cases” was not itself a statement of principle. It was the explanation for the view stated in the previous sentence that it is “possible to make too much both of the view expressed by Barwick CJ and of the qualification suggested”. The “qualification” was explained in the preceding paragraph:

To ask only whether the court has a doubt may place insufficient emphasis upon the fact that the jury, having seen and heard the evidence given, was in a position to evaluate that evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.

[101] If there is no difference between Barwick CJ in Ratten and Chamberlain, I prefer the formulation approved in Chamberlain, that is, whether the jury, acting reasonably, must have entertained a reasonable doubt or, as it was put by Hayne J in Libke at [113] (emphasis in original):

“the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.”

[102] My reason for preferring that formulation is that it is more accurate, since it acknowledges the function of the jury as the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence (a point reiterated in an earlier passage in M at 493.8). In an appeal, the Crown does not have to discharge an onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt for a second time; this Court is entrusted with the function of undertaking an independent assessment of the evidence for a different purpose. Submissions invoking the frequently quoted-passage from M sometimes appear to suggest otherwise.

[103] For the reasons stated by R A Hulme J, my own assessment of the evidence has not persuaded me that the jury must or ought to have entertained a doubt as to Glover’s guilt of the first two robberies.

[104] This Court is of course able to make an assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence in a circumstantial case but the advantage enjoyed by the jury in such a case is, in my view, important. It is not confined to the benefit each individual juror has of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The strength of 12 jurors as a tribunal of fact derives also from their number, their diversity and their opportunity to hear the evidence continuously and to deliberate as a group in private throughout the trial, evaluating the evidence together as it is given rather than reading the transcript afterwards on one’s own.


	
	I respectfully agree with the entirety of what McCallum J has said in those paragraphs. In particular, I do not interpret what was said in M v The Queen and very many subsequent decisions of the High Court as meaning that I am to undertake a de novo process whereby the Crown must prove its case all over again. Rather, the question is whether, bearing in mind all of the advantages that the jury enjoyed, and the fact that it is the time-honoured tribunal of fact with regard to proof beyond reasonable doubt of serious offences, the applicant has demonstrated that, on the evidence, the jury must have experienced a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	All of the points made by senior counsel for the applicant have sound force, and require serious reflection. In the ultimate, however, I am not satisfied that the applicant has made good this ground on the second basis. I say that for the following reasons.
	
	
	First, the graphic, detailed, and intimate entries in the private iPod diary of a young girl constituted compelling evidence against the applicant.
	
	
	Secondly, the fact that the complainant never expected those entries to be seen by a person in authority, and reacted angrily when her mother located them, adds probative weight to them. In other words, there could be no suggestion that the entries were made in order to inculpate the applicant falsely, for some reason or another. In fact, she wished very much to keep them secret, and was upset when her mother discovered them.
	
	
	Thirdly, the entries about sexual contact between the complainant and the applicant are scattered throughout a much larger body of entries that are about any number of other topics. They certainly show that the complainant was suffering from emotional and perhaps mental difficulties. But a careful reading of the entirety of the iPod diary shows no entry inherently suggestive of delusions or irrationality.
	
	
	Fourthly, the Facebook post – sent after discovery of the entries by the mother of the complainant, but before the intense involvement of the police – strongly supports the proposition that there had been an intimate and purportedly romantic relationship between the complainant and the applicant.
	
	
	Fifthly, it is true that there are discrepancies and confusions in the evidence of the sexual contact. But that is to be expected with regard to a young girl who, with regard to a large number of incidents of sexual contact, was interviewed three times, on 11 November 2013, 25 November 2013, and 9 January 2014, and gave evidence-in-chief, was cross-examined and re-examined in December 2014.
	
	
	Sixthly, it is true that at one stage in cross-examination the complainant agreed that she had been hallucinating. But at a later stage she denied that proposition, and firmly maintained that the vast majority of the iPod entries were true: see 9/12/14 TT28.14-28.49. There was also a crossed wire with regard to the meaning of the word “fantasy” in cross-examination. Taken as a whole, the cross-examination of the complainant showed that she was maintaining before the jury that everything in the iPod entries (except the claim of sex from behind) was correct.
	
	
	Seventhly, the situation of a young girl being repeatedly asked to elaborate upon intimate and graphic diary entries detailing her sexual contact with a much older man by police officers in recorded interviews, and thereafter by lawyers in court, inevitably gave rise to embarrassment and shame on her part. And, in the unusual circumstances of this case, those consequences were far more pronounced than in the “usual” child sexual assault trial (in which the complainant alleges that he or she did not enjoy the sexual contact in any way whatsoever). Those emotional consequences surely played a role in the deficiencies in the evidence of the complainant and the jury surely assessed them.
	
	
	Eighthly, it was quintessentially a matter for the jury to determine whether the good character of the applicant and his sworn evidence caused them to have a reasonable doubt with regard to the counts that resulted in a verdict of guilty.
	
	
	Ninthly, it is true that the position of the complainant changed from proclaimed love for the applicant and enjoyment of their sexual contact (at the time of the iPod entries and the Facebook message) to hatred for him, and to a claim (at the stage of the interviews and the trial) that, at the time of the sexual offences, she was fearful and oppressed. But the jury was entitled to reflect upon the degree to which that change of position damages the credibility of the complainant, as have I. I think that one would expect such a change to be adopted by a young girl, in the unusual circumstances of this matter.
	
	
	Tenthly, the withdrawal of the claim in the diary that the applicant had sexual intercourse from behind with the complainant, and the lack of any explanation whatsoever for the original making of the claim, is a very significant aspect of the evidence. It has caused me to reflect at length. Ultimately, however, I consider that it was the task of the jury to reflect upon possible explanations for a state of affairs whereby a young girl refers in a private diary to penile/vaginal intercourse in perhaps crude terms (“doggie style”); expresses in the diary her purported enjoyment of the sexual contact generally; thereafter sends a message to the applicant expressing her regret for the discovery of the diary entries by her mother, and her “love” for him; insists to the police that the man whom she had “loved” had not “raped” her; withdraws the particular claim and maintains that withdrawal; and, finally, is incapable of providing an explanation for the making of the original claim.
	
	
	Eleventhly, and finally, one knows from experience as counsel and judge that transcripts of criminal trials are a very ineffective record of what actually occurred at the trial in the presence of the jury, in terms of capturing the demeanour of witnesses and the prevailing atmosphere. The undoubted advantages that the jury enjoyed in assessing the evidence in the trial over me deserve to be fully respected.
	
	
	In short, the Crown case had undoubted weaknesses; apart from anything else, the fact that the applicant was acquitted on a large number of counts shows that. But I am not persuaded that the Crown case was so weak that the jury must have entertained a reasonable doubt with regard to the counts upon which verdicts of guilty were returned. In particular, I consider that the jury was entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the contents of the iPod diary were neither fantasies nor hallucinations, whether medication-induced or otherwise.
	
	
	It follows that I do not consider that the second basis of ground one has been established.
	


Conclusion regarding ground one


	
	Whether one considers each basis of ground one individually, or their combined force, I do not consider that the ground has been established.
	


Conclusion regarding appeal


	
	No ground having been established, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed.
	


Orders


	
	I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal with regard to ground two refused.
	
	
	Leave to appeal with regard to ground one granted.
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.

		11 April 2016",2016-04-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701829,Turner v Wheeler [2016] NSWSC 345,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff, Ms Turner, seeks leave to appeal under s 53(3)(b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Act”) from an interlocutory order made on 2nd April 2015 in the Local Court Queanbeyan. Dick LCM refused her leave to withdraw pleas of guilty entered to 26 of 84 counts of larceny by a servant contrary to s 156 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). She had earlier pleaded not guilty to 23 of the 84 (see [6] below).
	
	
	Contrary to Part 51B Rule 5(3) Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), the summons seeking leave to appeal was not filed until 11th June 2015. As the defendant does not object, I will make an order under Rule 5(5) extending the time for filing the summons to 11th June 2016.
	


Factual background


	
	The defendant, Detective Wheeler, is the officer in charge of the investigation and the informant named in the 84 Court Attendance Notices bringing the matters before the Local Court.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that the plaintiff was employed by a transport company from 10 October 2008 until her resignation in 2013. Her last day of employment was 15th March 2013. An audit subsequent to her resignation identified 84 instances of deposits of company funds into various bank accounts controlled by the plaintiff between 23rd January 2012 and 15 March 2013. The total amount allegedly involved is $243,966.81.
	
	
	The matters were first before the Local Court on 2nd December 2013, when the plaintiff was represented by an experienced solicitor acting as duty solicitor. All matters were adjourned to 20th January 2014 for the provision of further particulars. On that day the plaintiff was self-represented. She sought a further adjournment because her Legal Aid application had not been finalised.
	
	
	On the further adjourned date, 10th February 2014, the plaintiff was again self represented and entered pleas of guilty to 61 of the charges, and not guilty to 23 of them, being sequences 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 22, 23, 30, 32, 35, 40, 41, 42, 52, 54, 62 and 83. At the time of the entry of the pleas the following exchange took place between the learned Magistrate (Bone LCM) and the plaintiff (Court Book 50):
	


“His Honour:   … [C]an I ask this question, is there any particular reason why you are pleading guilty to some and not guilty to others?

[the Plaintiff]:    Because the others, I can prove I didn’t do them.

His Honour:   You didn’t do them?

[the Plaintiff]:   No

His Honour:   OK

[the Plaintiff]:   They’re in relation to business transactions that were done on behalf of the company.” [Emphasis added]


	
	The matter was listed on a number of further occasions during 2014 (the learned Magistrate noted that there had been 16 listings of the matter between December 2013 and April 2015: CB 39), including twice later in 2014 for a defended hearing. The plaintiff failed to appear on hearing through illness, or misadventure. Convictions were entered in her absence and warrants issued for her arrest. Upon the provision of the explanation for her non-attendance, the convictions were annulled.
	
	
	In her affidavit sworn on 22nd December 2014, read before the learned Magistrate on the application to withdraw the pleas, the plaintiff explained that she now wished to plead not guilty to a total of 47 of the charges. She swore that she had understood the advice of the duty solicitor given in December 2013 to be that:
	


“(a) The police case against me appeared very strong based on what was contained in the fact sheet; and

(b) Unless I could prove that I did not steel the money, I should plead not guilty to the charges.” (CB 129)

This had remained her understanding until she received advice from her current solicitor. She also sought to explain the long, subsequent history of the matter, including the misadventure and illness that had befallen her.


	
	About the advice of her current solicitor she said:
	


“… I understand that the police must prove its case against me and I did not have to prove my innocence. I did not understand this before speaking with Mr Herring in his office.” (CB 131).


	
	She also set out a summary of the evidence she intends to give in her own defence. She said that she wished to maintain her plea of guilty to 37 charges involving $134,475.60, but plead not guilty to a total of 49 charges totalling $108,491.21.
	
	
	She was cross-examined on her affidavit at the hearing on 2nd April 2015. One must bear in mind that the atmosphere created by, or feel of, the cross-examination cannot be recreated in an appellate court. However, it was not expressly put to the plaintiff that the evidence in her affidavit was untrue. It was established that the pleas of guilty had been entered after she had legal advice from the duty solicitor and had taken the opportunity to check documents she had at home. The following exchanges occurred:
	


“Q.   … Why do you want to change your pleas now?

A.   Because I’ve obtained further advice, I have been advised by my solicitor now that I can plead … not guilty to charges when I haven’t got concrete evidence (CB 32-3).”

and

“Q.   So effectively today you’ve been told something from [your solicitor] -

A.   Yes.

Q.   You’ve got a defence or -

A.   Yes.

Q.   Some information to suggest that you’re not guilty of that -

A.   Yes.

Q.   - Charges?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you want to exercise that right. Is that right?

A.   That’s correct.” (Emphasis added.)

Arguments below


	
	On behalf of the plaintiff it was argued before the Magistrate that the pleas of guilty did not “reveal a consciousness of guilty” as the plaintiff did not understand the incidence, burden and standard of proof. Her misunderstanding that she had to prove her innocence was a fundamental misunderstanding of the criminal justice system. Being held to the pleas of guilty in the circumstances would result in a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Despite not having challenged the truthfulness of her account directly in cross-examination the police prosecutor argued that the plaintiff’s evidence “can’t be true” (CB 38). He also pointed to what most lawyers would regard as the unfortunate history of the proceedings, “16 adjournments in this case either for mention, for hearing or for other matters” and to the “late stage” which the application was made (CB 39). He argued that the purpose of the application was to “[delay] the inevitable” (CB 39). Again, it had not been put to the plaintiff that what she said was a device. The prosecutor reminded the Magistrate that pleas of guilty may be validly entered by persons who believe they are innocent for a variety of reasons that the accused perceives to be in his or her own interest.
	
	
	Although it is not put forward as a ground of appeal, I think it important to say that the requirements of ethical advocacy do not permit a witness’ credibility to be called into question, as occurred here, unless the witness has been given a fair opportunity to answer the accusation whilst giving evidence. Indeed, such a matter goes beyond the ethical obligation of advocates to the fairness of the trial process itself: Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. However, as I read the learned Magistrate’s reasons, he did not decide the case adversely to the plaintiff because he accepted these particular prosecution submissions that her explanation was not true or that the proposed change of plea was a delaying tactic.
	


The Magistrate’s reasons


	
	In a succinct ex tempore judgment, the learned Magistrate refused the application “to traverse the pleas”. His Honour recognised that leave was required, and that the onus lay upon the plaintiff (on the balance of probabilities) of establishing “good and sufficient reason for allowing the application” (CB 40). His Honour also directed himself that he “should approach the application with caution”.
	
	
	His Honour referred to a “ready reckoner as such” in relation to considerations that “I have to employ today” (CB 40) and listed relevant cases. His Honour directed himself that he was to “have regard to the matters outlined in those cases”. Amongst the considerations to which he had to “have regard [was] whether the plea of guilty was entered free and voluntary” (sic). At the outset decided his Honour “that it was” (CB 40). His Honour went on to consider the other factors which he considered arose out of the cases to which he referred. His Honour was “not satisfied that the plea was not – attributable to consciousness of guilt” (CB 41). His Honour concluded:
	


“I do find that at the time [the plaintiff] had possession of all of the facts, knew exactly what she was facing and entered that plea of guilty in relation to each of those matters of her own free will and informed decision.”


	
	Before leaving the reasons for the Magistrate’s order, it is important to record that, with respect, that his Honour misapprehended the plaintiff’s evidence (and therefore argument) in a material way. He said (CB 40.35):
	


“The plea of guilty to my mind was entered unequivocally, but (the plaintiff) seeks to change her plea on the basis of (her solicitor’s) advice. In her words today the prosecution does not have concrete evidence against her.”

Grounds of appeal


	
	As I have said, it is common ground that the order of the learned Magistrate refusing leave to withdraw the pleas and dismissing the application is an interlocutory order under s 53(3)(b) of the Act. Accordingly an appeal lies only on the ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave.
	
	
	The grounds of appeal propounded by the plaintiff are as follows:
	



	
	The plaintiff contends that his Honour erred by applying the wrong test of law when determining the plaintiff’s application to traverse a plea of guilty in the Court below
	
	
	The plaintiff contends that his Honour posed a series of rhetorical questions that did not reflect the appropriate test and summary of principles as enunciated by Howie J in Ming Yuk (Raymond) Wong v The Director of Public Prosecutions 2005 NSWSC 129.
	


The argument of the parties


	
	Although Ground 1 is couched in the language of “applying the wrong test at law”, it is clear that both grounds of appeal taken together essentially involve a misdirection point. That is to say, that the learned Magistrate “has defined other than in accordance with the law the question of fact which he [had] to answer” to decide the application: Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Limited (1985) 4 NSWLR 139; 9 ALN N245 at 156 by Glass JA.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s argument was essentially that the learned Magistrate misdirected himself because he failed to address the question whether the plaintiff’s plea was vitiated because she misunderstood the incidence, burden and standard of proof. That is to say, the ground she advanced was that from the advice she had received (it is not necessary for the purpose of the argument to say that it was wrong) the plaintiff formed the misunderstanding that she would carry the onus of establishing her innocence by providing concrete evidence that she was entitled to the funds transferred to her account rather than appreciating that she was presumed to be innocent unless and until the prosecution proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and that that burden and standard of proof at all times remained upon the prosecution.
	
	
	The application of his Honour’s ready reckoner led his Honour to consider, as it were, fixed categories of circumstances sufficient to enliven the discretion to give leave for the pleas to be withdrawn. Moreover, his Honour’s misapprehension, and misstatement, of the evidence of the plaintiff demonstrated that he had not defined the question of fact on which this case turned according to law.
	
	
	The defendant argued that errors in applying a legal test are generally errors of fact or involving mixed questions of fact and law: R v P L [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A CrimR 199 at [26]; Azzopardi at 156C and 157B. Moreover, the defendant also argued that his Honour identified the right question by asking whether the plea was freely and voluntarily entered; that his reference to the consideration which had been discussed in previous decided cases was apposite; and there was nothing in his ex tempore reasons to suggest that he had misdirected himself in any way about the applicable principles.
	


Applicable principles


	
	The governing principles are discussed in Meissner v The Queen [1995] HCA 41; 184 CLR 132. At page 141 Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ said:
	


“A person charged with an offence is at liberty to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge, whether or not that person is in truth guilty or not guilty. … A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if a court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not in truth guilty of the offence.” [Emphasis added]

In the same case Dawson J in an oft-cited passage (at 157) said the following:

“… an accused person has a right to enter a plea of guilty and to do so whether or not that person believes himself to have committed the offence with which he is charged. It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person's belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. Ordinarily that will only be where the accused did not understand the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the facts admitted by the plea he could not in law have been guilty of the offence. But the accused may show that a miscarriage of justice occurred in other ways and so be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and have his conviction set aside.” [Emphasis added]

Clearly, from the sentence I have emphasised, Dawson J was not intending to state the circumstances in which a plea might be permitted to be withdrawn exhaustively.


	
	In Maxwell v The Queen [1996] HCA 46; 184 CLR 501, after stating in substance the principles I have set out above, Dawson and McHugh JJ said (at 511):
	


“The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered. But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty.” [Emphasis added]

Gaudron and Gummow JJ (at 531) said:

“There is more to the grant of leave to withdraw a plea than alteration of the record. Ordinarily, it involves a consideration of the circumstances in which the plea was made, with leave being granted if it resulted from a mistake of fact or a misunderstanding of the law, inability to obtain legal representation or if the interests of justice otherwise require.” [Emphasis added]


	
	It is clear from these statements of principle that the categories of cases in which a court will grant leave for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty are various, not fixed, and not closed.
	
	
	In Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 129; 155 A Crim R 35 at 42 [18] – [19] Howie J said:
	


“But where the resolution of the application depends upon the magistrate forming a view as to the integrity of a plea of guilty as an acknowledgment or confession of guilt, and where that matter can only be resolved by forming a view as to the defendant’s knowledge and understanding of the effect of a plea of guilty or by determining the circumstances in which the plea was given, there is no room for short cuts or informality. There may be cases where the objective facts make it plain that a doubt must arise about the integrity of the plea, but that would be an exceptional state of affairs.

A plea of guilty is clearly a very significant step in a criminal prosecution. The ramifications arising from the plea are obvious. Yet a court is entitled to rely upon that plea as an acceptance by the defendant of his guilt and to convict and sentence him relying solely upon the plea: Meissner v R at 141. The plea of guilty in the Local Court is so significant that a defendant can only appeal to the District Court against conviction following a plea of guilty with leave: s 12 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act. Therefore, if there were any basis upon which the integrity of the plea is seriously called into question or any other reason that would make it unfair for the court to act upon the plea, there would inevitably be a miscarriage of justice by refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw the plea and defend the charge.” (Emphasis added.)

Decision


	
	I am satisfied that in refusing leave for the plaintiff to withdraw her plea of guilty to counts 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 27, 28, 29, 33, 34, 36, 37, 53, 56, 57, 69, 72, 78 and 84, the learned Magistrate fell into an error of law by defining otherwise than in accordance with the law, the question of fact which he was called upon to answer. In the circumstances of this case, that question was whether the plaintiff’s misunderstanding of the incidence, burden and standard of proof vitiated the guilty plea as one “entered in the exercise of a free choice in the interests” of the plaintiff.
	
	
	I acknowledge that the learned Magistrate (at 40 CB.20) referred to the question “whether the plea of guilty was entered free and voluntary” (sic) and in stating his conclusion found that the plea of guilty had been entered “of her own free will and informed decision”, but those statements pitched the question at too great a level of abstraction which failed to engage with the issue which had been presented for his determination.
	
	
	The learned Magistrate’s misstatement, and misapprehension of the plaintiff’s evidence as to why she wished to change her plea is also important. Certainly this mistake may be characterised as an error of fact and therefore beyond this court’s power. On the other hand, it is a clear indication, with respect, that his Honour failed to discharge his duty to quell the actual controversy which had been presented for determination. I accept this misapprehension demonstrates he failed to define the actual question of fact that arose for determination in the case in accordance with the principles of law I have set out above (at [25]-[28] above).
	
	
	The questions his Honour had to answer were first, did he accept the plaintiff’s evidence? This is, of course, is a pure question of fact. His Honour was not bound to accept it: McPhee v S Bennett Limited (1934) 52 WN (NSW) 8 at 9. But acting judicially one would require good reason for rejecting evidence that was not challenged in cross-examination. The second question was if the plaintiff’s evidence was accepted, did it prove that the pleas of guilty were entered in circumstances suggesting that they were not true admissions of guilt because in entering the pleas the plaintiff was actuated by ignorance, or a misunderstanding, of the law. This second question was the ultimate question of fact that the learned Magistrate had to decide. Azzopardi demonstrates that the failure to formulate it in accordance with the law is an error of law, notwithstanding that the answer ultimately given is one of fact. That is to say, whilst the ultimate question is one of fact, the failure to formulate the question in accordance with the law is itself an error of law.
	
	
	It may be that his Honour’s reliance on his “ready reckoner” led him into error because he failed to consider the breadth of the principle applicable. A handy summary of the factors which have been considered sufficient to justify the withdrawal of a plea, and those which have not, is a very useful tool in a busy court. But such aids are not a template which will fit all cases. As I have said, the categories of case in which leave will be granted to withdraw a plea of guilty are neither fixed nor closed. It is necessary in every case to engage with the actual issue presented for determination.
	


What order should be made


	
	An issue arose about whether I have power to substitute my own decision for that of the Magistrate if leave were granted and the Appeal allowed. This arises from the terms of s 55 of the Act governing the disposition of appeals. Interlocutory appeals are dealt with in s 55(3) which is in the following terms:
	


“ (3) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against an order referred to in section 53 (3) (a) or (b):

(a) by setting aside the order and making such other order as it thinks just, or

(b) by dismissing the appeal.”


	
	The question is, does the power to make “such other order as [the Court] thinks just” extend to making the order which I find should have been made at first instance, notwithstanding that the appeal permitted by s 53 in the present case is limited to a ground that involves a question of law alone?
	
	
	After the conclusion of the oral hearing counsel provided written submissions on this question. The plaintiff submitting that I had power to substitute my own decision for that of the Magistrate, and the defendant submitting to the contrary.
	
	
	Essentially the plaintiff relied upon the width of the statutory language and the decision of Beech-Jones J in Bimson, Roads & Maritime Services v Damorange [2014] NSWSC 734. His Honour was there concerned with the Court’s powers conferred by s 59 of the Act for determining prosecution appeals brought under s 56. Section 59(2) is materially identical to s 55(3). Whilst noting that s 75(A) Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) did not apply to appeals brought under the Act (see 75A(3)(a)), his Honour applied the reasoning in Thaina Town (on Goulburn) Pty Ltd v City of Sydney Council [2007] NSWCA 300; 71 NSWLR 230 at [83] to [87]. He held that the court could exercise the discretion of the court below anew “when no findings of fact were required” Bimson at [34].
	
	
	As I have pointed out, the learned Magistrate misstated the plaintiff’s evidence. This consideration would necessarily require me to correct the error by making findings of fact in accordance with the evidence before exercising any “discretion” anew. The reasoning in Bimson does not permit me to go this far. I interpolate that the power being exercised by the Magistrate is arguably not a discretion. Rather it called for the application of normative standards fixed by law to facts as found by the learned magistrate.
	
	
	RH v Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWCA 305 at [43] Basten JA (Beazley P agreeing) said that on appeals limited to questions of law the appellate court was not empowered to substitute its own conclusion of fact unless that was the only conclusion legally available.
	
	
	The plaintiff also relied upon R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320 at [22]. However, that was a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in an appeal brought under s 5F Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Once leave was granted, the appeal was not limited to a ground involving a point of law alone and the court had ample express powers to make the order it considered ought to be made in the circumstances of the case (s 5F (5)).
	
	
	It might be said that if the evidence of the plaintiff is accepted, supported as it appears to be by what she said to Bone LCM on 10th February 2014 (the transcript formed part of Exhibit 2), only one conclusion is open. However, as that conclusion would require me to find facts not found by the learned Magistrate, it is not open to me to give effect to that view. Accordingly, the matter must be remitted. Although s 55(3) contains no express power of remitter, such an order is covered by the power to make such other order as the court thinks just.
	
	
	For these reasons my orders are:
	



	
	Extend the time for filing the summons to 11th June 2015;
	
	
	Grant leave to appeal;
	
	
	Appeal allowed;
	
	
	Set aside the order pronounced in the Local Court at Queanbeyan on 2nd April 2015 refusing the plaintiff’s application to withdraw her plea of guilty to charge reference H53660265, sequences 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 27, 26, 29, 33, 34, 36, 37, 53, 56, 57, 69, 72, 78 and 84;
	
	
	Remit the application for further determination in the Local Court on the evidence taken on 2nd April 2015 and in accordance with these reasons.
	
	
	The defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal on the ordinary basis forthwith after they have been agreed or assessed.

2701834,R v Pleace [2016] NSWDC 178,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 3 July 2015 I sentenced Troy Douglas Pleace, along with two co-offenders, for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. I imposed a sentence of three years six months with a non‑parole period of two years. The non-parole period expires on 17 July 2016.
	
	
	I am now to sentence him for two offences committed about a month earlier than the offences for which I have previously sentenced him. In those circumstances, the principle of totality must be borne in mind. That principle often means that offenders receive shorter sentences than they would receive if they were sentenced for individual offences committed at completely separate times. The principle is given effect to by, usually, partially accumulating sentences. It is also necessary to bear in mind that in order to preserve the statutory ratio, or a ratio of non-parole period to head sentence other than the statutory ratio, special circumstances need to be found. On the other hand, the offence I am about to describe was completely separate to the one for which Mr Pleace is currently serving a sentence. There were completely different victims, and completely different motivations for Mr Pleace’s offending.
	
	
	Mr Pleace formed a relationship with a Ms Vitalis, indeed she was one of the co-offenders who appeared for sentence in July 2015. Ms Vitalis worked as a prostitute and one of her clients was a Mr S. Mr S was in a relationship with a Ms J, they lived together in Coogee. On occasions Ms Vitalis would provide sexual services to Mr S, sometimes in the presence of Ms J.
	
	
	In October 2013, Mr S attended Ms Vitalis’s home where she was introduced to the offender Mr Pleace. It is clear that Mr Pleace was not happy with the arrangement between Mr S and Ms Vitalis, his girlfriend. He told a psychiatrist that he believed that Ms Vitalis was being mistreated.
	
	
	So, on 5 November 2013, the offender went to the premises where Mr S and Ms J lived and knocked at the door. It was about 7 in the morning. Ms J opened the door and saw the offender standing there. The offender asked whether Mr S was home and, when asked by Ms J who he was, the offender gave her his correct name and pulled a crowbar out from underneath his jacket. He moved past Ms J and into the premises.    
	
	
	At this stage Mr S, was wearing only a T-shirt, was sleeping on the lounge in the back of his home. The offender threatened Mr S and demanded money from him. He said that it was money that Mr S owed. He was holding the crowbar and swinging it towards Mr S. Ms J overheard the offender say something like “you owe me money, if you ask for a girl then you have to pay for her, you pay for my girls”.
	
	
	There is obviously conflict between what Mr Pleace was saying to Mr S as to why he was threatening him with the crowbar and the motivation that Mr Pleace had according to his version given to the psychiatrist.
	
	
	Mr S offered to pay money because he did not want any trouble. He said “I never meant to cause you to be upset and I’m sorry for whatever happened”. Mr Pleace then threatened to hurt Mr S with the crowbar and struck Mr S, using that weapon, to his left forearm. As a result, he experienced pain and suffered swelling to his left forearm.
	
	
	At one stage the offender and Ms J and Mr S went upstairs. He continued to threaten Mr S verbally and by swinging the crowbar towards him. Mr S said “whatever you need us to do we’ll do it, just please don’t hurt us”, the offender said “as long as you do what I say I won’t hurt her”, of course the “her” was a reference to Ms J.
	
	
	After they went downstairs, the offender told Mr S to get on his knees and he ordered Mr S to apologise to Ms J for the manner in which he had previously treated her. Mr S assured the offender that he would not call the police and then made his escape. He ran to a dry cleaners where police were called.
	
	
	As the offender the left the house, he was able to see Mr S and he continued to verbally threaten him. Mr S could see, outside his premises, Ms Vitalis and a second unidentified male. The three then left the location. Mr S was taken to hospital via ambulance. His left forearm was X-rayed, fortunately there was no fracture found.
	
	
	As a result of the events I have just described, the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to commit the serious indictable offence of intimidation, as well as an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the first matter is 14 years and for the second matter it five years.
	
	
	The Crown also presented a Form 1 offence which contained on it an offence of common assault committed against Ms J. However, when I asked Mr Pleace about that matter today he denied that he was guilty of common assault, and so I will not take the matter on the Form 1 into account.    The two offences for which Mr Pleace appears for sentence are counts 1 and 3 on an indictment presented against him on the day his trial was due to commence.
	
	
	The Crown accepted pleas of guilty to counts 1 and 3 in full satisfaction of the indictment. Although those pleas appear to be late, upon analysis they were entered at the earliest opportunity. Count 3 had never been presented against him, either at the Local Court or previously, until it appeared on the indictment presented on the day of trial. Although count 1 as originally laid against Mr Pleace was a charge of aggravated enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, the serious indictable offence particularised was not that of intimidation.
	
	
	Thus, I am satisfied that Mr Pleace pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 3 at the earliest opportunity available to him. I will, therefore, impose upon him a sentence which is 25% less than it would otherwise have been in order to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.
	
	
	Mr Pleace is a troubled man. He suffers from schizophrenia. His difficulties are apparent even today as he sits in the dock. During sentence proceedings he was distracted by the lights, indicating that there was a connection between the lights and God. His behaviour in court is only to be expected given the findings of the forensic psychiatrist, Dr Kerri Eagle, in a report tendered to me today.
	
	
	It is apparent that Mr Pleace has suffered from schizophrenia for a significant period of time. That illness may have been masked on occasions by his drug use, but I am satisfied that the diagnosis is accurate and that the symptoms reported by Mr Pleace are genuine.
	
	
	Some of the history Mr Pleace gave to the psychiatrist is not accurate, but I do not believe that he was attempting to mislead the psychiatrist. I accept that he genuinely believes those things which he told the psychiatrist, even where the objective evidence would tend to contradict that belief. The best example of this is Mr Pleace’s reference to him having been convicted of drive in a manner dangerous occasioning death, or perhaps grievous bodily harm. No Mr Pleace hears voices and receives messages from television. I accept that many aspects of what Mr Pleace told the psychiatrist are accurate, certainly his criminal history is suggestive of a person who had the problems that he describes to the psychiatrist.
	
	
	As far as his moral culpability is concerned, the psychiatrist says this:
	


“Mr Pleace’s judgment is generally impaired as a result of his mental illness…schizophrenia is also associated with cognitive impairment including higher executive function. This can result in impairments and problems of inhibition and planning. However, Mr Pleace’s account of the index offences suggested that his motive for the offences was one of anger and retribution. This is not a psychologically driven motive. Given his experience of anger, he likely lacked the problem solving abilities or inhibitions to manage his response appropriately”.


	
	So whilst these offences were not directly a result of, for example, Mr Pleace hearing voices, his lack of problem solving abilities or inhibitions to manage his responses appropriately were clearly contributing factors to the commission of the offence. In those circumstances, his moral culpability is reduced.
	
	
	Mr Pleace is a person who clearly is an inappropriate vehicle for the imposition of a sentence reflecting a significant component of general deterrence, but there is no reason that personal deterrence should become unimportant. Mr Pleace must know that he cannot continue to act this way. He has a significant criminal history and he must realise that every time he commits a significant criminal offence he is going to receive a custodial sentence. If he wishes to avoid custody, he must stop committing criminal offences. I am satisfied that the custodial sentence that I must necessarily impose will weigh more heavily upon him.
	
	
	Given Mr Pleace’s criminal history, and given the conclusions of the psychiatrist as to the risk of further violent offending, it has to be said that Mr Pleace’s prospects of rehabilitation are bleak. The psychiatrist says that Mr Pleace is a member of a group of persons who are at high risk of violent reoffending in the longer term. While that is a statistical analysis which is probably accurate as regards a group of people, the problem is, of course, that such analysis says little about the risk of further offending of Mr Pleace as an individual. Despite that, I am satisfied that there is a high chance of Mr Pleace reoffending given the nature of his condition and his criminal history and the conclusion reached by the psychiatrist.
	
	
	Mr Pleace expresses his remorse. He, indeed, said that he was sorry for what he did while speaking, uninvited, to me in proceedings today. On the other hand, the psychiatrist noted that Mr Pleace’s acceptance of responsibility and expressions of regret appeared to be superficial.
	
	
	In assessing the objective gravity of these offences I bear in mind, as far as count 1 is concerned, that intimidation is a much less serious indictable offence than others which could be the subject of that charge. Those who enter a dwelling house with intent to sexually assault someone, those who enter a dwelling house with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm would still be charged with an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, and so in assessing the objective gravity of Mr Pleace’s misconduct that circumstance has to be borne in mind. The offence of intimidation is, I repeat, much less serious than other serious indictable offences which could be the subject of charges under s 112(2).
	
	
	As far as count 3 is concerned, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, I note that the offender used a weapon, indeed a crowbar, with which he struck Mr S’s forearm. The injuries themselves were not terribly serious and they are unlike to have had any long terms consequences for Mr S, but the use of a weapon is a matter that has to be borne in mind when considering the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct as far as count 3 is concerned.
	
	
	When I earlier sentenced Mr Pleace, I made a finding of special circumstances in his favour. Mr Howell, who appears for Mr Pleace, asks that I make a similar finding. I will do so but will not be as generous, at least in percentage terms, as I was earlier. There are a number of reasons for this.
	
	
	Firstly, the sentence I will shortly announce is the least that I believe properly reflects the objective gravity of the offender’s crimes. And secondly, the period that I will allow for Mr Pleace to be released to parole is, I believe, sufficient. If he is to respond to treatment, then the period I determine will be plenty of time for him to do that.
	
	
	I should have mentioned earlier that quite clearly these were planned offences. Mr Pleace turned up intending to do what he did, arming himself with a crowbar in order for him to achieve his objective.
	
	
	As I think I might have mentioned earlier, Mr Pleace’s existing non-parole period expires on 17 July 2016. I will give effect to the principle of totality by commencing the sentence I will shortly announce one year earlier, from 17 July 2015.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence covering both counts 1 and 3 on the indictment. Were I to have imposed separate sentences, I would have imposed a sentence of four and a half years on count 1 and 18 months on count 3. Instead, I impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non‑parole period of three years to date, as I said, from 17 July 2015. It will expire on 17 July 2018, on which day Mr Pleace is eligible to be release to parole.
	
	
	The aggregate head sentence is one of five years making an overall sentence, taking into account my earlier sentence, which consists of a non‑parole period of four years with a head sentence of six years.
	
	
	The report of Dr Eagle is to accompany the warrant so that Corrective Services staff may be given as much information as possible as regards Mr Pleace’s mental state.

Court or Tribunal:   District Court of NSW

Jurisdiction:   Criminal

Medium Neutral Citation:   

Date of Decision:   17 August 2007

Before:   Hosking DCJ

File Number(s):   2004/013814

EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (on application by Applicant for leave to file a notice of motion – revised from transcript)


	
	ADAMS J: The first matter to be dealt with is a notice of motion and leave is required to file the notice of motion. The notice of motion seeks to reinstate his application seeking leave to appeal the orders of Justice Hulme filed on 27 August 2015 and his motion filed on 25 September 2015. Those applications call for equitable relief and/or orders and declarations “that will serve to restore the applicant’s substantive common law and corresponding constitutional right to set aside the perverse conviction” and (c) his appeal’s bail application filed 22 October 2015.
	
	
	As to the first matter this was in substance dealt with on the last occasion and orders made in relation to the provision of further material. Accordingly, this matter has already been dealt with by the Court. Secondly, the motion of 25 September 2015 has also been dealt with on the last occasion. Thirdly, the applications relating to what is called equitable relief and declarations are not within the purview of this Court for the purpose of dealing with this appeal. Accordingly, there is no basis for considering such an application and since we are here to hear the appeal the question of bail doesn’t arise and at all events is not before the Court. For those reasons I propose that the leave to file the notice of motion should be refused.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: The effect of the orders made on the last occasion was that the applicant was able to place before this Court written submissions totalling 690 pages. The result of that was to modify to a very substantial degree the orders that were made by R.A. Hulme J which the Applicant wishes to again complain about. Further, lest there be any misunderstanding, this applicant has had every opportunity since the matter was adjourned to respond to the Crown’s written submissions that were filed prior to the hearing on the last occasion. In addition, there appears to be some underlying complaint from the applicant that he has not had the opportunity to respond to the further submissions of the Crown which have sought to address the 690 pages which I referred to earlier. Of course the very point of today’s hearing is to enable him to have that opportunity. For those additional reasons and the reasons given by Adams J I agree with his Honour’s proposed order.
	
	
	ADAMS J: Accordingly leave is refused.
	


[The hearing of the appeal then continued]

EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT (on application by applicant to withdraw his appeal)


	
	ADAMS J: In this matter the applicant has for the reasons which he has stated “for the record” and which are on the transcript decided that he wishes to abandon his appeals both as to conviction and sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submits firstly that there is a discretion in this Court to refuse to permit abandonment, that is to say that leave of the Court is required before he should be permitted to abandon his appeals. The Crown points to the extensive amount of work already done by the Crown in relation to this matter and the time that the Court has spent dealing with it over the years and more recently in reading submissions, attending and reading evidence and submits, as I understand her, that it is not in the interests of the due administration of justice to permit the appeals to be abandoned on the assumption that leave is required. Does that fairly state your position, Ms Crown?
	
	
	CROWN PROSECUTOR: Very fairly, with respect.
	
	
	ADAMS J: Thank you. The Court is of the view however that firstly there may well be a right to abandon an appeal. Neither the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 nor the Criminal Appeal Rules mention the necessity for leave but even if leave were required we consider that it is appropriate to grant leave. The applicant is unrepresented. The case does have some complexities. He says for various reasons he is not ready. Objectively speaking it is very difficult to accept that submission and, indeed, we have rejected an adjournment based on that argument. However, it seems to me that the Court ought not prevent him from the abandoning of his appeals if that is what he wishes to do. There is no discernible prejudice to the Crown. It follows therefore that I would propose that the appeals be abandoned.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the reason and orders proposed by Adams J. I wish to add the following. As stated by Adams J, it seems likely, although it is not necessary to decide, that an appellant in the applicant’s position has a right to withdraw their appeal at any stage. However, even if that is not the position then, notwithstanding the strong points put by the Crown, I would agree with Adams J that as a matter of discretion the Court would grant such leave. This is so because in the absence of any relevant form of prejudice to the Crown, a person who is facing a maximum sentence of life imprisonment should not be forced to pursue an appeal against their will.
	
	
	In stating this it should be noted that I do not accept that this applicant has had anything other than the most generous opportunity to prepare for his appeal. He has had a number of years to do so. It is clear from the materials he has filed at various points that he has had very fulsome access to the material concerning his trial. He has with the leave of this Court, and contrary to the previous view taken by RA Hulme J, already been able to place some 690 pages of written submission before the Court. He has demonstrated an ability to produce written material of large length on short notice. In short, he has had an opportunity to prepare for his appeal that is, as I have said, generous.
	
	
	Of course the position that the Court may take if there is a further attempt to file appeals out of time will be a matter for the relevant Bench that considers it. However, I think it is important to note what I have already just indicated as well as the fact that, despite all these opportunities, the applicant was still protesting that he had not put his appeal in the form that he wished to and that that was what led to him withdrawing his appeal.
	
	
	Finally I should record my, and what I understand is the balance of the Court’s, appreciation of the work undertaken by the Crown in responding to the difficult circumstances that they were confronted with. I otherwise agree with Adams J.
	
	
	ADAMS J: I agree with the additional comments made by Beech-Jones J. Accordingly the Court will note the abandonment of the applicant’s appeals both as to conviction and sentence.

		29 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701839,R v Nichols [2016] NSWDC 91,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Nichols if you could stand up please I will tell you what orders I propose to make. Taking into account the discounts that I propose to give you for your pleas of guilty and the co-operation which I have calculated as a combined discount of 45% I propose to sentence you to 23 months imprisonment. That’s one year 11 months imprisonment, the starting point of the sentence taking into account the objective facts and the subjective matters or the mitigating factors and the like before the discount was three and a half years, three years six months. I propose not to at this stage impose a term of full-time custody. I propose to have you assessed for your suitability for an intensive correction order but I just want to make it abundantly clear to you that if you’re unsuitable, or ineligible, I do not propose to suspend the term of imprisonment. So you will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in relation to this matter of the full-time custody as the Crown has submitted and I don’t want to misrepresent the Crown’s submission was within the appropriate sentencing discretion of the court. I use those expressions in the context of the High Court judgment of Barbaro. You can take a seat.
	
	
	The prisoner appeared before me in the February sittings of the Wagga Wagga District Court in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at what was, for want of a better description, a “super” callover of matters listed for disposal within the District Court sittings within the Riverina district, that is at Wagga Wagga, Griffith and Albury. Apparently the judge conducting that callover had a large number of matters, some matters he disposed of, some matters were fixed to be dealt with at subsequent sittings of the Wagga Wagga District Court or elsewhere.
	
	
	I say from the outset it has been a very difficult sentencing exercise for reasons I’ll dilate upon in a moment. When the matter last left me at Wagga I had evidence from the prisoner, his mother and a family friend. I have got no transcript of what occurred at Wagga, the fault may well be with me rather than the transcription service, although I do have extensive notes. When the matter came on before me, if my memory serves me correctly, heard in the period before 10 o’clock when a judge is sitting in regional sittings conduct sentence and appeal matters before attending to trial obligations, learned counsel for the prisoner, Mr Walsh, led the evidence to which I referred. But then at some point he indicated that there was a need for some assessment to be made of the co-operation the prisoner would wish to extend to the prosecuting authority. Thus the matter was adjourned till today’s date to enable the relevant inquiries to be undertaken and those inquiries have been undertaken.
	
	
	The consequence is that this morning, before again I started the further hearing of another criminal trial, I heard, or received evidence in relation to these additional matters and then helpful submissions of course from Mr Walsh and from the learned Crown Prosecutor. The learned Crown Prosecutor’s oral submissions supplemented written submissions prepared by the solicitor who had the carriage of the matter at Wagga. It must be fairly said that there was some departure from the written submissions in the oral submissions of the learned Crown which I will deal with very briefly.
	
	
	It turned out that amongst the material that was tendered this morning there was reference to other material including extensive interviews conducted with the prisoner, which were not annexed to the statement that was tendered as part of the material relating to his undertaking to co-operative with the prosecution. I obviously needed to see that material. My time has been extremely limited and it is unfortunate that I have not had more time to reflect upon the material that has been prepared, although I had reflected upon what had been done before this point last night and this morning.
	
	
	The crime that the prisoner has pleaded guilty to in the District Court, having been committed for trial, is a crime contrary to s 86(3) Crimes Act 1900. The specifics of the offence are that on 26 April 2014 at Young in the State of New South Wales the prisoner while in the company of Eissa Attalah detained Robert Bradstock without his consent and with the intention of obtaining an advantage namely the return of a sum of money and an amount of prohibited drugs, and at the time of such detaining did occasion actual bodily harm to Robert Bradstock. This is an offence that carries the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and naturally I am very mindful of the scheme of s 86. That is that for an offence contrary to s 86(1), described as “basic offence”, the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	For an “aggravated” offence, that is an offence containing one or other of the aggravations that both have to be established in respect of s 86(3), the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The aggravations in the “specially aggravated” form of the offence being, in company of another person or persons, and at the time of or immediately before or after the commission of the offence actual bodily harm was occasioned to the alleged victim. Obviously by the plea and by the material within the statement of facts the prisoner was at relevant times in company of the man who I will refer to as the “co-accused” and at relevant times actual bodily harm was inflicted upon the victim.
	
	
	The victim, I hasten to say, was 17 years of age. The prisoner was born on 1 September 1987. On my quick calculation he would have been 26 years of age at the time. This offence as I said been committed the day after Anzac Day.
	
	
	The sentencing of the prisoner was a difficult exercise in this sense, although all sentencing exercises now are increasingly difficult particularly with the complexity of the legislation with which we have to deal. A first reading of the facts left one quite, if not shocked as very little shocks a judge who has been a judge for some period of time, but certainly recoiling from aspects of the treatment of the victim, the detention of a person, the infliction of harm upon him for the purposes of pursuing the advantage pleaded. There would normally fill the ordinary person with feelings of considerable distaste.
	
	
	But when one analyses the facts and further material that has been provided today, in the context of assessing both the objective seriousness and the moral culpability of the prisoner, in the context I hasten to say of the authorities to which I will refer in a moment, there was assessed on my part at least a somewhat different complexion then was my initial reaction particularly when I was in Wagga and the material was first presented to me.
	
	
	It is to be pointed out in relation to the matter by reference to matters that are clearly relevant to sentencing of this prisoner that, firstly, the plea of guilty was entered after committal for trial but in the context of being indicated before the “super callover”, held in Wagga Wagga in November last year, and then entered in the “super callover”, without a trial date actually having been fixed or if fixed some months away. Although I am not bound by any “agreement” between the parties, it was generally agreed in the circumstances of the matter, it was appropriate to assess a discount of 20% to represent the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I had not understood fully, but now fully understand, that in fact although the plea of guilty was entered after committal for trial the prisoner had, almost from the outset of the matter being reported to the police by the victim, co-operated with the investigating authorities in a range of ways. He surrendered himself as I understood his mother’s evidence on her advice to the police. He made full admissions in an extensive interview that was conducted on 26 April and I have managed to read that transcript today. He then participated in a video recorded “walk through” in which he made a number of other admissions and was further interviewed again on 2 May and made further or more expansive admissions to those that had already been made. Why he was actually committed for trial in all these circumstances is a little unclear.
	
	
	His confessional material was enough to prove his guilt one would have thought. Perhaps in the scheme of things it may have been hoped subsequently on committal for trial a lesser charge may have been preferred. But these matters do not detract ultimately from the assessment of the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. The prisoner I point out in passing has had no time in custody in relation to the current matter save for some short time I assume under arrest on 26 April.
	
	
	Since the prisoner gave evidence before me and indicated his continued willingness to cooperate with the authorities, I have now material in the form of a statement which annexes the interviews which I have already referred to and in the form of confidential material that demonstrates on the part of the prisoner timely, and in my view complete, cooperation in the context of the particular matter with which I am concerned. The context of the cooperation is a matter that I discussed, at least with the learned Crown Prosecutor, today.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor very helpfully alerted me, or drew my attention to some recent authorities in respect of the assessment of a discrete discount for cooperation with the investigating authorities or the prosecution in the context of the terms of s 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The two authorities to which the learned Crown took me were SL v R [2015] NSWCCA 30, and Z v R [2014] NSWCCA 323. In fact the Crown very helpfully highlighted for me the relevant passages from those judgments.
	
	
	It is clear from those judgments, to pick up something that was referred to by the learned Crown, what was determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the 2006 decision of Sukkar ([2006] NSWCCA 92) still largely applies. I was the sentencing judge in Sukkar and I was held, quite properly, by the Court of Criminal Appeal to be in error. There was an adjustment made of a discount that I gave to Mr Sukkar for his cooperation with the prosecuting authorities. That is an adjustment downward. In that judgment, Howie and Latham JJ, Latham J at greater length, discussed changes that were approved by that decision to the way in which cooperation may be assessed. It may be said that one of the consequences of Sukkar was to in effect reduce what might be thought to be an acceptable level of discount for cooperation.
	
	
	To come back for example the decision of Z, at [27], the Court in that judgment reaffirmed the view, as I would understand first expressed in Sukkar, that a single combined discount should be given for both the plea of guilty and assistance, and that such a discount should not normally exceed 50%. This was a view shared in the subsequent judgment of SL, and certainly it was the view of their Honours in the decision of Sukkar.
	
	
	Of course these matters are to be assessed in the context of the terms of s 23 of the Act and also in terms of the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 as it relates to the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. By reference to s 23 of the Act it is clear that the cooperation was entirely timely. In fact it was as timely as it could possibly be, and it was complete from the outset. It has continued and is now evidenced in the ‘undertaking’ signed by the prisoner now in evidence.
	
	
	The evidence of the offender will be needed in the prosecution of the co-accused Mr Attalah who still awaits his trial. I am appreciative of the fact that there will be degrees of burden upon an offender in providing cooperation. The person may be required to give evidence at multiple trials and the like, or against multiple accused. But I can only deal with this matter in the context of what the prisoner could possibly do and he is prepared to do all that can be possibly expected of him.
	
	
	Thus, I have determined that he should receive a discount, as I earlier said, of 25% in addition to the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty, noting those relevant factors arising under s 23.
	
	
	The prisoner at the time of the commission of the offence had no prior criminal convictions. Interestingly, this aspect of the matter, apart from being a relevant mitigating factor both at common law and under s 21A(3), is a matter that is discussed in the context of the appropriate principles in sentencing for offences of this type, particularly when considering what the superior courts have described as the “motive” of the particular offender, a matter which I will address shortly.
	
	
	The facts of the matter are, without having to regurgitate the very detailed facts in the Crown bundle, that the prisoner knew it would seem largely through common use the prohibited drugs the man I have described as the co accused. These men, in various ways, knew other people including the victim Robert Bradstock. He was a friend of person called Jordan Braham who lived in Young where the prisoner then lived. Apparently on 26 April in the early morning they got together, they went back to the prisoner’s residence, then located at 149 Chums Lane, Young, consumed some drugs, which I understand from the facts largely belonged to Attalah, hence explaining his motive for the involvement in this matter. The prisoner during this period of time sold his motor vehicle for $5,000 for cash. It is clear the victim became aware of both the existence or presence of the drugs and the cash in the house. He was actually present when drugs were consumed and the cash was handed over. He consumed prohibited drugs himself.
	
	
	Eventually the victim and Braham and another man drove around the Young area and went back to Braham’s residence in Young. About 4.30am the victim stated to Braham that he could not sleep and he was going to go for a walk. The victim subsequently informed police, after he raised the alarm, that he actually walked to the prisoner’s house at Chums Lane, took the cash that belonged to the prisoner, that was legitimately obtained by him I hasten to say, and the drugs that were in the premises that he had seen earlier in the morning.
	
	
	The prisoner came around to what I understand to be Braham’s residence, obviously smoke coming out of his ears, seeking to find out what had happened to the money and the drugs. It is clear, although not expressly stated in the facts, he had already spoken to Attalah, and Attalah’s awareness of what was happening is demonstrated by his subsequent involvement in the matter. The prisoner addressed the victim and Braham, not knowing precisely which of them he should properly suspect for the theft of his money and the drugs. He drove them to his home. He said to the victim, “Fingers are going to be coming off shortly if we don’t figure this out.” But the victim, rather foolishly although I do not criticise him, denied knowledge of his now known theft of the money and the drugs.
	
	
	On arriving at the prisoner’s home, the prisoner told the victim and Braham to go “to the shed”. The prisoner appeared at the shed where the two young men were waiting in possession of a hunting knife. He approached the victim and punched him twice to the left side of his face causing the victim pain. He told the victim to sit down and he sat on a camping chair inside the shed. It was shortly after that Attalah arrived. Attalah directed the prisoner to tie the victim up and the prisoner tied the victim’s hands and feed, and the man Attalah grabbed a grey coloured roll of duct tape, being CT tape, and wrapped it around the victim’s mouth.
	
	
	Eventually that tape was taken off the victim’s mouth, a rag was picked up from the floor and that stuffed inside the victim’s mouth and the victim was interrogated for a period of time.
	
	
	Mr Atallah left the shed, it would appear, for some period of time and returned with what I now understand to be some type of small baseball bat. It is said in the facts that Mr Atallah became angry and struck the knee of the victim. The victim felt pain and then he assaulted the victim with the bat striking him in both his feet and stomach area.
	
	
	Throughout the assault Braham was waiting outside the shed but he did hear the victim screaming. The prisoner in his interview with the police refers to the victim crying at one stage which one would expect he must have been very fearful for his safety and no doubt suffered some pain.
	
	
	Eventually the victim said he knew where the “stuff” was and Atallah said that he would take the victim for a drive. He left the prisoner behind. The victim was taken to an oval or a sporting ground in Young and made good his escape, eventually telling is mother what happened and eventually the police were alerted.
	
	
	As a result of the assault or assaults upon the victim he received injuries to the end of his middle and ring finger on his right hand, soreness and bruising to the outside of his left knee which I take to be from the striking with the baseball bat, soreness on the bottom of both feet and soreness to the left side of his neck. No medical evidence is available, no hospitalisation was required. No victim impact statement exists. It is a little difficult, apart from the injury to the knee, to ascribe a particular cause of some of those injuries. Clearly they constitute actual bodily harm, but in the scale of injuries that constitute actual bodily harm it would appear they’re at a lower end of seriousness. It appears to be no permanent disability and certainly there are no fractures or permanent scarring involved.
	
	
	The prisoner surrendered himself to the police in the early afternoon of the same day. These events that I have described constituting the offence, I hasten to say, commenced shortly after 10.30am. I was at a loss to understand how long the relevant events have taken, but the Crown assures me that the period of time was about an hour, perhaps slightly less between the time the prisoner picked up the victim to the time that he made good his escape. The cash has not been recovered. The victim has not been charged for the alleged theft.
	
	
	There is another feature of the objective facts to bear in mind. I think quite fairly conceded by the Crown and, if not expressly stated in the facts, are certainly to be implied, that is the striking of the victim with a bat may well be viewed as at least reasonably possible as an act outside any “joint criminal enterprise”. It is correct the prisoner bears responsibility for the conduct of the co accused, amongst other reasons, and in a moral sense he did not try to stop him, but reading the interviews the prisoner gave to the police I note he said in the very first interview he gave to police,
	


“I didn’t actually think he’d do it and then he hit him across the knee caps and I actually felt sick and I couldn’t, I couldn’t be there. I had to - I walked away.”


	
	He then said,
	
	
	“And I went in there” (I take that to be the shed) “and tried to help him out and told him if he just, just told him” (that is Atallah) “where it all was, nothing like - I promised that he’d be able to leave, like, and he didn’t. Eissa just keep, I don’t know, where he like where he hit and that after that because I couldn’t watch it.”
	
	
	He then went on to say the victim came “clean”.
	
	
	That series of representations by the prisoner did not find their way into the facts, but that series of representations by the prisoner will be part of the evidence I expect the Crown will be relying upon if the matter of co-accused goes to trial in proof of the guilt of the co-accused.
	
	
	I have no reason to doubt that what the prisoner said in those representations was true. Thus, I also take into account, again in fairness to the helpful submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor, the concession, although it was not expressed as a concession, that whilst the prisoner bore some responsibility for what the co-accused did he was not the person who introduced that particular weapon, although he did threaten the victim with the hunting knife. He did not expressly direct that it be used and his own version of events in fact he did not want it to be used although, again, he did not try to stop the other offender from striking the victim.
	
	
	There is just one other feature that is worthy of note from the representations made by the prisoner. It is an answer to question 28, it may appear elsewhere in the other interviews, in the interview of 26 April 2014. The prisoner was talking about the $5,000 that was taken. In fact, I would have to say, stolen by the victim. He explained,
	


“and because I quit my job in Western Australia trying to fix my family life but it didn’t work so I sold the car to keep feeding my kids and paying the mortgage so that when it was gone I shit. It’s like I got no money so I went and picked the young bloke up...”.


	
	Those representations by the prisoner in my view are true as well.
	
	
	When the prisoner gave oral evidence before me he talked about the fact that he had been in a relationship with a woman who was the mother of a child who I believe is aged now five years. He has another child from another relationship and the mother of that child provided a character reference in these proceedings which I take into account.
	
	
	The prisoner gave evidence before me that he had purchased a house for the mother of his second child, that is Jessica, if I may call her by her first name. My note says that he paid $330,000 for that house and he was required, amongst other things, after the separation to pay some form of allowance or maintenance to her for their child and for the care of the child who is now aged nine.
	
	
	He also gave evidence that his relationship with Jessica, which had been going on for seven or eight years, had broken down and he was in a bit of a “mess” as a result of that breakdown. It caused him a great deal of distress. He had been working away from Young to support his family. None of this evidence was challenged.
	
	
	It is clear on the evidence available to me from his mother, from Mr Cooper and from the written references that the prisoner, having some trade qualifications, is an industrious young man and has continued to try to find employment when he can since being charged in relation to the current matters.
	
	
	It is clear too that in the context of his then financial circumstances the money that was taken, legitimately acquired I hasten to say again, was very vital for a range of reasons. Not for the purposes of buying drugs or buying a new car but to meet financial commitments in circumstances where he had no employment. I accept that evidence to be true and in my view it is a matter that is to be borne in mind in assessing some features of this offending.
	
	
	Firstly, it is clearly offending without planning. It is clear the prisoner obviously lost his temper and in his own mind well knew who must be the suspects. In fact he was quite right that one of the two young men he picked up was in fact the person who took his money. As the guardian of the other drugs which he had used that morning he no doubt felt some responsibility for that. I accept that he was not just looking for the money he was looking for the drugs but apparently they did belong substantially to Mr Atallah.
	
	
	It is in this context that he picked up the victim. He said in his interviews with police, again not a matter that found its way into the facts, that he had no intention of chopping off fingers and I accept that to be true. He did threaten the young man with a knife, as I have said, and that would have been a frightening experience, but I accept that he had no intention of using the knife although he did strike blows to the victim’s head, albeit not causing any substantial injury.
	
	
	He was committing an offence that could fairly be described as impulsive and in my view driven by the genuine and legitimate need he had for the cash legitimately acquired.
	
	
	Also, it is quite clear in the context of earlier ingesting drugs and his fragile emotional state that he was not - for want of a better word - in the best of mental condition to be making reasoned judgments about how he should go about recovering the money. I accept as a sort of background matter - not really the subject of any submission - that one of the difficulties he had with taking his complaint to the police, for example, was that whilst the cash was legitimate he would have to reveal to the police the existence of the prohibited drugs, or he knew that they would find out about those, which compounded his conduct.
	
	
	Having said all that, and taking those matters into account in the context of assessing his moral culpability and also so far as the impulsiveness of the offending, in assessing the objective seriousness it has to be clearly pointed out that this offence can be rightly categorised as a “vigilante” type crime the way in which a number of the different types of detention of persons contrary to s 86 may be categorised. The decision of Newell, to which I earlier referred, set out some basic propositions in relation to sentencing in this area of the law. There had been a decision of Roden J back in the 1980s, early 1990s in a case of Collett and Robson in which his Honour set out some basic propositions in relation to the repealed s 90A offence.
	
	
	The character of s 86 offences, which are the statutory descendants of s 90A, is somewhat different than that provision. It has been properly pointed out in Newell and then again in the decision of Speechley ([2012] NSWCCA 130) that s 86 offences are have a wider ambit than the former “kidnapping” crime. S 90A in its terms was a direct product of the abduction and murder of the young Graeme Thorne in 1961. In the decision of Speechley, in his usual erudite way Johnson J surveyed the relevant law in relation to sentencing pursuant to s 86. In particular I refer to [47]-[64] and other observations about the approach to sentencing in this area, particularly in relation to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offending at [81]-[87] and his analysis of the case at bar by reference to the general authorities at [105]-[119].
	
	
	A number of things emerge from this very careful analysis of the law. For example at [52] he refers to one category of a s 86 offence, amongst other categories elsewhere cited, that he describes as “vigilante conduct” and he cites decisions such as Williams (2006); Barlow (2008); and Rayment (2010), to which I earlier referred.
	
	
	I have taken the trouble today to re-read those judgments and refresh my memory. It was observed by Howie J in Newell offences under s 86 he doubted would be “sufficiently homogenous that a reference to statistics alone would be of much assistance” and for that reason I take it the parties have not bothered to provide me with any statistics.
	
	
	His Honour, in the context of dealing with the authorities relating to vigilante type offences are noted. Some of the observations in those cases that I have just cited, such as made by McClellan J, then CJ at CL, include the following:
	


“The offence committed by the applicant was serious, motivated by the wrong she believed was previously done to her...she took the law into her own hands.”

“...the rule of law requires that offenders be tried by the appropriate authorities and if convicted punished in accordance with accepted principle. In our society crime is dealt with by the Courts.”


	
	Hall J had pointed out that vigilante conduct was,
	


“The antithesis of what is required in a society based on the rule of law and is to be denounced in the strongest terms.”


	
	However, in that regard Hall J, with the approval of Johnson J, also observed by reference to authorities I have already cited,
	


“The relevance of motive will vary depending upon the particular facts of the case. It may explain why the offence was committed without condoning it or excusing it. The more serious the offence committed the less weight that can be given to motive as a mitigating factor, even if it might otherwise have had that effect.”


	
	But as was pointed out in Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47,
	


“The existence of motive is relevant to other factors that may impact upon the sentencing discretion. In this case, particularly with respect to the respondent Gallagher, it partly explains why he committed such a serious offence notwithstanding he had no prior criminal record and was otherwise considered a person of good character, apart from his use of illicit drugs. The existence of the motive indicated that in his case there was no need for personal deterrence.”


	
	In my view, that is the case here.
	
	
	His Honour went on to say,
	


“It may to some degree mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence yet indicate the need for a more severe sentence in order to address issues of deterrence.”


	
	I take it his Honour there is referring to “general deterrence.” To my mind here it some degree mitigates the objective seriousness of the offence. Amongst other things it informs the impulsiveness of the conduct and the lack of planning, although the element of general deterrence will remain present.
	
	
	In relation to the categorisation of the seriousness of the offending in the decision of Speechley which, whilst it was concerned with a different motivation, has a number of similar characteristics here. His Honour, rejecting a submission on behalf of the respondent in the Crown appeal that the offence was towards the “lower end of the scale of objective gravity” - this is in respect of a s 86(2) offence I appreciate - said “It was an offence of significant objective gravity, well above the lower end of the scale.”
	
	
	With that analysis of the objective seriousness of this matter I agree, but as I said earlier, the objective seriousness of the offending is to be seen in the context of other matters including the moral culpability issue to which I referred and of course any relevant other mitigating factors, as well as other matters that militate against the otherwise appropriate sentence such as discounts for pleas of guilty and the like.
	
	
	I appreciate comparative sentencing exercises are fraught with danger, and I appreciate that nobody has actually submitted to me that any of the authorities to which I have referred - that I have researched of my own undertaking in detail - reflect any true comparative sentencing exercise.
	
	
	But I note in relation to, for example, the matter of Speechley, that the Crown appeal was against an order of imprisonment of one year and 11 months that was suspended pursuant to s 12, where ultimately the Court imposed a term of imprisonment fixing a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 11 months. In other words, did not interfere with the sentence but confirmed that it be converted to full time imprisonment. It is the case that some of the other vigilante type appeals involved similar sentences that were sometimes not interfered with. One case involved in fact a s 11 remand which the Court decided not to interfere with, albeit that it was recognised that a term of imprisonment would eventually be imposed.
	
	
	Here of course there are features present that are not present in the matters to which I have referred as vigilante cases including, for example, the case of Speechley. The respondent in Speechley of course had pleaded guilty. She was a young woman I hasten to say, 19 years of age. She had no prior convictions. But on the other hand the grievance that gave rise to the detention of the victim, the reason for the vigilante action, was a claim by a friend of hers that she had been sexually assaulted by the victim, who was threatened with guns and struck on the head with a rifle.
	
	
	Thus, in assessing the objective criminality of that matter by reference to motive, her motive was to support a friend, not to reflect upon any grievance that she had. It would be clear from the facts of that case there was considerably more planning, if not sophisticated planning, in the commission of the offence than here. The victim there of course was detained for up to two hours and was threatened with death by the three offenders when the detention occurred. With regard to that matter however, there was no issue of cooperation to be assessed as it related to contrition, or in the assessment of any further discount, and I noted for what it is worth, that the prisoner was essentially unrepentant, at least when interviewed by police, because she said she was simply helping her friend.
	
	
	This prisoner in the course of his evidence and in the course of his interviews with police at a much more timely occasion, expressed disgust and regret for his conduct and has done so to his mother in the evidence that she gave of that and in the evidence of Mr Cooper. He referred to the prisoner’s regret and the fact that he was truly contrite. In fact Mr Cooper made the point, seeing him on the day of his arrest, that the prisoner said to him that he had “stuffed up big time” and he described him when he saw him - as I understand it that day - as “an emotional mess”.
	
	
	That having been said of course, the starting point of any sentence that I believe is appropriate in this matter, noting the greater maximum penalty is higher, in fact substantially higher than the sentence that was imposed, for example, on Ms Speechley. But this prisoner of course gets the additional discount for the cooperation. It goes without saying in the assessment of this matter I have had regard to what was said in Newell, particularly in respect of the factors to be taken into account, approved again in Speechley. These include the period of the detention which was here for about an hour; the circumstances of the offence in which I have summarised; the person being detained - I note a 17 year old who had stolen the prisoner’s money was no ingénue - and the purpose of the detention, which I have reflected upon.
	
	
	It is clear by reference to the evidence available to me both orally and in the documents tendered by the prisoner that the prisoner is an industrious person, as I earlier pointed out. He is greatly devoted to his children and he is a good provider for them. He has obtained employment since his arrest in Young and has moved away from the Young area. There is no suggestion whatsoever of continued threat to the victim. In fact the prisoner ceased to be a danger to the victim when he went to the police and confessed his wrong doing.
	
	
	The Court obviously has regards to s 3A of the Act. I have already reflected upon some of those for the purposes of sentencing, the significance or relevance of general deterrence; the absence of any need for personal deterrence; there is a need to adequately punish the prisoner and make him accountable for his conduct and denounce it. But on the other hand, there is a need also, as the purposes of sentencing made clear, to promote his rehabilitation.
	
	
	I have taken into account the evidence of the comparative circumstances of the co-accused, who I hasten to say remains unconvicted. He is a person of similar age to the prisoner, and like the prisoner at the time of the commission of this offence - assuming that he was involved - had no prior criminal convictions, although I note that he has some findings of guilt that have arisen subsequently which has not happened in the case of the prisoner. I accept the prisoner, since the commission of this offence, has taken a different path. He has moved away from the district; he has maintained his employment; he is working in an enterprise where he is subject to daily drug testing, so he has overcome his use of prohibited drugs and he can continues to support his family.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor who appeared at the Wagga Wagga sittings, as I said, prepared written submissions. The learned Crown Prosecutor appearing for me today does not adopt some of the written submissions made. Particularly so far as those submissions are concerned, I have already reflected upon the objective facts and the use of the baton, or the bat, as being something for which the prisoner, if legally responsible, is not morally responsible. The Crown also, as does the defence, nominates as the relevant aggravating factor to be found pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act, that the offence involved both actual and threatened use of a weapon. The prisoner threatened the use of the knife, and there was the actual use of the baton in the presence of the prisoner in the circumstances I have outlined.
	
	
	The earlier Crown Prosecutor had submitted the offence was part of planned or organised criminal activity. That is just not open on the facts. In fact, I find as a mitigating factor that it was not planned activity. I mean no disrespect at all to the previous Crown Prosecutor, he is a very abled young lawyer and was most helpful in the sittings in Wagga. But if the Crown is to prepare a set of written submissions and is to put to the Court what it says are the relevant, for example, mitigating factors that arise under s 21A(3), one would hope in a spirit of open mindedness and fairness the counsel in question - not the Crown who appears before me now - would be honest enough, or at least open enough, to acknowledge all relevant mitigating factors.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor who prepared the written submissions identified remorse as a mitigating factor but sought to qualify by it by reference to authority and the plea of guilty as mitigating factors under s 21A(3). It is quite clear by reference to the section that there are a number of mitigating factors under that provision in addition that are to be taken into account, as was submitted by learned counsel for the prisoner. Those mitigating factors include the fact - apart from what I have already identified - that ultimately, even though there was actual bodily harm, the injuries suffered by the victim was not “substantial”; the prisoner was “provoked” by the victim in the manner I have described; the prisoner did not have any record of previous convictions; the prisoner, notwithstanding some drug use, was a person of good character. I accept the prisoner is unlikely to reoffend.
	
	
	I accept the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of his age or because of his prior good character or because of his capacity to find employment and his support for his family. I find not only that there is remorse but in my view it is very powerful evidence of remorse, evidenced by the prisoner within hours of the commission of the offence, not something delivered to this Court at the heel of the hunt. It may be genuine remorse in that instance but is of little mitigating effect. Of course the plea of guilty is a mitigating factor to be taken into account.
	
	
	Clearly the threshold, if I can call it that, identified in s 5 of the Act, has been crossed and a term of imprisonment must be imposed. I have already indicated what is the starting point in the context of the maximum penalty, the assessment of the objective seriousness, the identification of the moral culpability of the prisoner and factoring in, as best I can in accordance with “Markarian” principles, the relevant mitigating factors that arise, both under the Act and at common law.
	
	
	With regard to the purposes of sentencing I am reminded of what the High Court said about the four purposes of sentencing, the majority identified in Veen (No. 2) v R (1988) 165 CLR 465.
	


“However sentencing is not a purely logical exercise and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from the unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society; deterrence and of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend; retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.”


	
	There is one other matter of general principle I believe arises in this particular case, taking all matters into account and taking into account all that has been put on behalf of the Crown and the defence. These are the observations made by then Wood CJ at CL in Blackman and Walters ([2001] NSWCCA 121) where his Honour reflected upon principles deriving from South Australia that even in matters where general deterrence may loom large in fixing an appropriate sentence there was:
	


“still a need to consider all aspects of the matter and to consider the interests of society and the offender and the rehabilitation of the offender. Also, in an appropriate case, there may be room for the exercise of mercy and leniency.”


	
	As King CJ said in Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 at 112-3:
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of and it assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders and others who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an order (sic) to avoid offending in future the protection of the community is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm.”


	
	Of course, that general observation is to be seen in the context of the particular offence with which one is particularly dealing. In that regard I also am mindful of what was approved by Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment of Henry where his Honour referred, in the context of laying down the guideline judgment for armed robbery matters, acknowledged that what Acting Chief Justice Mahoney had said in Lattouf v R was entirely correct, that justice was individual and if individual justice was not given in a particular case it is “nothing”.
	
	
	So I come back to where I started. This was a troubling sentencing exercise. My initial reaction was, on my first reading of the facts, this is a man who had to go to gaol for a substantial period of time, in context, giving due weight to what I understood was the fact he had no prior criminal convictions. However, when one scratches into the matter and sees all the material or as much of the material as has been revealed to me, one can see the delicate balance that is involved here. I have taken into account of course the fact the prisoner receives a discrete discount for his cooperation but there is another aspect of that, and that is I accept, as was put by his learned counsel, that if he was to be sentenced to fulltime custody, whatever period of time that would be, he would almost certainly, in the context of giving evidence from custody against a co accused which would become well known around Junee gaol from where he would have to come to give evidence at Wagga and throughout the system, serve his sentence in protective custody. In the context, I hasten to say, of being a person who is not an experienced criminal and not a person who has previously served any time in custody.
	
	
	Of course, there is always a first time to go into gaol. I have already indicated to the prisoner it may inevitably end up that way.  But I have concluded in the circumstances of the matter, doing my best on short time to reflect, I have determined that I should foreshadow a term of imprisonment of less than two years and consider and in fact order that the prisoner be assessed for his suitability for the serving of an Intensive Correction Order. I am very mindful of the fact, even though it might not have been fully appreciated in the particular submission made by learned counsel for the prisoner about this matter, that given his employment commitments he either may not be eligible for an Intensive Correction Order or, if he is to become eligible for an Intensive Correction Order, he may have to give up his employment for the period of time that I will order. That period, if ultimately to be served by Intensive Correction Order, will require the performance of Community Service, attendance upon Community Corrections and a range of requirements that are not necessarily compatible with the employment arrangements that the prisoner has. It is a more stringent restraint than a suspended sentence.
	
	
	If I have not already pointed it out I must confess, in the context of the evidence that was given, I was very impressed with the evidence of the prisoner as to what clearly were positive steps taken by him to address his offending behaviour to the extent that he could address it in the way in which it arose and take steps to avoid finding himself in the situation in which he now finds himself on this occasion.
	
	
	Thus, in the circumstances of the matter, noting everything that has been put by the learned Crown Prosecutor and giving full respect to the position that he properly and honourably has taken I have concluded at this point I should not impose a term of fulltime custody but adjourn the matter for the assessment that I foreshadow.
	
	
	So that brings us back, Mr Crown and Mr Walsh, to an adjournment so an Intensive Correction Order can be assessed. I want to make it abundantly clear I am not contemplating a suspended sentence. That would have an inherent degree of leniency in the circumstances of the matter and inconsistent with my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending and I want to make it abundantly clear I have come to that conclusion in full recognition of the principles that are reflected upon in Speechley on this very matter and also discussed for example in the 2002 decision of Howie J in Zamagias.
	
	
	Now we would need at least six weeks for an assessment. When is six weeks’ time? I hasten to say, Mr Crown and Mr Walsh, I’m sitting in Queanbeyan the first two weeks of June. That’s probably eight weeks away but if it was of greater convenience to the parties to send the matter to Queanbeyan, and subject to the convenience of the prisoner although he must fit in with us to some extent, I would be prepared to stand the matter over to Queanbeyan. I don’t know, I don’t know what’s--
	
	
	WALSH: I have some difficulties in that period of time your Honour but certainly any time after the middle of May I’m free to the end of May.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I was supposed to take two weeks’ leave in the beginning of May and because of the Commonwealth trials I’ve got at the moment that is going to impact upon my leave and I may be presiding over the second of the two trials I’ve got concerning the one accused until the middle of May but I have a matter listed on Friday 27 May and even if was taking that leave that I’m losing, even if I was on leave up until that date I’d come into court on that day anyway because I’ve got to prepare to go to Queanbeyan.
	
	
	WALSH: I’m free on that day, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 27 May Mr Crown?
	
	
	PINCOTT: I think I’m free on that day your Honour, yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well I’m prepared to grant the prisoner bail. I suppose I’ve got an option, haven’t I, to remand him in custody but in the context of the reasoning I’ve reached I’m prepared to continue his bail.
	
	
	PINCOTT: I think it’s proper to continue his bail.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It will facilitate the preparation of the report.
	
	
	PINCOTT: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I am mindful I can remand him in custody, notwithstanding what I’ve said but what I’ll do is I’ll list the matter--
	
	
	WALSH: Whatever time your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You tell me. You gentlemen are travelling down from the country. Is in the afternoon better or 9.30 in the morning okay?
	
	
	PINCOTT: Afternoon is better for me but I’m in Mr Walsh’s hands.
	
	
	WALSH: Yes, I think it’s better probably for me too, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’ll list it not before 2pm on Friday 27 May. I just have to make a formal order.
	
	
	Mr Nichols, do you understand what is happening? I am adjourning your matter now for about seven or eight weeks to enable a report to be prepared. You will be required to report to the nearest office of the Community Corrections Service. Are you living at Port Macquarie at the moment?
	
	
	OFFENDER: I am in Port Macquarie, yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well there’s an office at Port Macquarie. I will continue your bail with the additional condition that you are to report to the officer in charge of what is now called the Community Corrections Service at Port Macquarie within seven days. Do you understand that?
	
	
	But you will also be required to go to Wagga to give evidence in the trial of the co accused. Now just something I should tell you, you had better bear this in mind. You’ve got rights of appeal. The Crown has got rights of appeal. The Crown can appeal against this order I have made and the Court of Criminal Appeal could impose a greater sentence. But one thing that can happen is this.
	
	
	I just make it very clear to the accused, if you fail to cooperate with the Crown at the trial of Mr Atallah on 18 April, even before I get to see you on 27 May, the Crown might appeal what I have done anyway. That is the Crown’s right. It is perfectly proper, but that is what our system thrives on, the right of the parties to redress what they regard as injustices or errors on the part of a judicial officer. But if you fail to cooperate with the authorities the Crown can go straight to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the discount I have given you will disappear and I can tell you one thing for certain, if the discount I foreshadow disappears that’s 25% for your cooperation, then the sentence I must impose must involve a term of full time custody because it will be bigger than two years. If you add 25%, in the appropriate mathematical way, onto what I calculate to be 23 months that adds at least another eight or nine months to that period which means you will go to gaol and I will be required then to consider the fixing of a non-parole period.
	
	
	But the orders I make in the meantime, having made that very clear to you, are these:
	
	
	You are convicted. I have considered s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am satisfied for the reasons given that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate and the sentence of imprisonment will be for a period of no more than two years. You are referred for assessment as to your suitability for an Intensive Correction Order as a means of serving the sentence. Bail is to continue but you are to attend the Community Corrections Service at Port Macquarie within seven days of today and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that service. You can take a seat.
	
	
	Otherwise the matter is adjourned, as I said, until Friday 27 May 2016 not before 2pm. You are excused from the dock, Mr Nichols. You can take a seat behind your learned counsel and solicitor.

		27 May 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2701842,Chiang v R [2016] NSWCCA 45,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: Michael Chiang seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Scotting DCJ on 2 October 2015 for the supply of ecstasy tablets, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. There is no standard non-parole period prescribed.
	
	
	His Honour sentenced Mr Chiang to a term of imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 2 October 2015 and to expire on 1 April 2017 with a non-parole period of 9 months expiring on 1 July 2016. His Honour discounted the sentence by 25 percent to reflect Mr Chiang’s early guilty plea.
	


Background


	
	The facts were in relatively brief compass.
	
	
	On Saturday 1 November 2014 police were conducting a drug detection dog operation at the entrance to a music festival at Luna Park in Sydney. At 5.30pm police saw a man in the pier area adjacent to Luna Park who was seated and talking to Mr Chiang. Both men were leaning in close to each other and were continually looking about. After a short time the men shook hands. Mr Chiang placed an item into a shoulder bag that he was carrying before standing and walking away. As he was walking along a footpath away from the side entry to Luna Park he was seen to take a mobile phone from his shoulder bag and commence a conversation. He was heard to say, “Nah, I’ve got to go home and wrap them first.”
	
	
	Mr Chiang ended the phone call when a police officer approached and introduced himself. When asked what he had on him, Mr Chiang reached into his pocket and removed a small resealable bag containing 24 ecstasy tablets. He was searched but no other items of interest were located. In a subsequent conversation with another police officer Mr Chiang confirmed that the tablets had been in his pocket. The 24 tablets were later analysed and found to comprise 7.1 grams of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine with a purity of 18.5 percent.
	
	
	The statement of facts (which were not disputed) concludes: ""The accused was in possession of the 24 MDMA tablets for the purpose of supply"".
	
	
	Mr Chiang was 25 years of age at the time of sentence. He has a criminal record which, aside from driving offences, includes being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence and larceny. He has been subjected to nothing more severe than fines, good behaviour bonds and disqualification from driving.
	


Mr Chiang’s case


	
	Mr Chiang gave evidence. He said that he agreed with the statement of facts. He stated that he recognized the man he spoke to as being a drug dealer (although in cross-examination he said that he had never seen the man before). The man did not give Mr Chiang any drugs because he had “his own stuff”. He agreed that he used the words “Nah, I’ve got to go home and wrap them up first” but did not remember with whom he was speaking when he said this. He said that he did not know what he meant by that comment. In cross-examination he confirmed that he lived at Carlingford and was about to go into the dance party.
	
	
	Mr Chiang said that he got the 24 pills from a friend at university and paid $300 for them. They had been purchased for his own consumption. He said that he intended to go to the music festival and consume ten pills himself over a period of eight to nine hours. He intended to distribute the remaining 14 pills to five or six of his friends who would be at the same festival. He was not going to receive any money from his friends in exchange for the pills. Mr Chiang agreed to collect the drugs for his friends because it was his turn to take them to the festival. He stated that other people had bought ecstasy for him on other occasions at festivals in the past.
	
	
	Mr Chiang conceded that he had a drug problem. He started taking ecstasy about three years ago by taking one pill but his tolerance built up and he needed to take more. He had not taken any drugs since his arrest. He was asked about the Pre-Sentence Report in which it was recorded that he told the author ""he had never used any illicit drugs"" and that he ""was adamant that he had never used or even experienced [sic – experimented] with any illicit substances"". Mr Chiang explained in his evidence that he was conveying to the officer that he had not taken ""addictive drugs such as ice and heroin"". He put it down to ""miscommunicating"" with her. He was also reported to have told the author that all of the drugs were for his friends but not for profit or personal use. When asked in cross-examination about that he said, ""No I didn't say that, I said that I consume ecstasy"" and that ""they were for my friends and for myself"".
	
	
	Mr Chiang said that he was attending university and did not have any employment. His mother supported him. She had given him $100 to purchase a ticket to the dance party. There was no direct evidence as to the source of the $300 used to purchase the tablets.
	


Grounds of appeal


	
	Mr Chiang relied upon two grounds of appeal:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in not being satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the applicant’s evidence was sufficient to satisfy him that the drugs were in the applicant’s possession for the purpose of supply as outlined by the applicant.

Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Ground 1


	
	Part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence was in the following terms:
	


“The offender bears the onus of calling evidence and proving on the balance of probabilities matters to be taken into account in favour of the offender outside the agreed facts, R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27]. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender’s evidence is sufficient to satisfy me that the drugs were in his possession for the purposes of supply as outlined by him. The evidence given by the offender in this regard was vague and lacking specificity. It was self-serving and uncorroborated. He did not name any of his friends who were supposedly a party to this arrangement or call any evidence from them. I do not accept that his mother has the financial means to support him in all aspects of his life including the purchase of illegal drugs. I do not accept that the arrangement specified by him in his evidence was likely to occur and in my view his evidence about the intended consumption and supply of the drugs was untrue.

That leaves the Court in the position in which it is hard to assess the true involvement of the offender, but that can often be the case in these types of offences. I do not by these reasons accept or imply that the offender was involved in supply for a profit, nor do I accept or infer that there were any other aggravating features. I am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was involved in trafficking or otherwise substantially involved in supply.”


	
	Mr Chiang complained that his Honour erred in finding that the evidence was vague and lacking in specificity, was self-serving and uncorroborated and that none of Mr Chiang’s friends was identified. He also complained that his Honour proceeded to find that Mr Chiang’s mother did not have the financial means to support him and that the specified arrangement was unlikely. Mr Chiang also challenged his Honour’s rejection of his evidence about consumption as untrue.
	
	
	The difficulty confronting Mr Chiang in establishing these challenges is that he must demonstrate that his Honour made an error, not merely that he reached a conclusion or formed an opinion with which Mr Chiang disagrees or is otherwise unhappy. At the heart of Mr Chiang’s attack upon his Honour’s rejection of Mr Chiang’s own evidence is a contention that his Honour was not entitled to do so. However, his Honour’s assessment of Mr Chiang as a credible or reliable witness or otherwise was a matter peculiarly within the scope of his Honour’s task. The evidence given by Mr Chiang was available in whole or in part for acceptance or rejection by his Honour. The story proffered by Mr Chiang concerning his intentions about consumption of the drug or its distribution to friends was never something that his Honour was bound to accept. This ground of appeal can only succeed if his Honour rejected the evidence in question when it was not open for him to do so.
	
	
	The jurisdiction of this Court to interfere in the present context is exercisable only where there can be seen to be some error of principle or mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108; Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284; R v O’Donoghue (1968) 34 A Crim R 397 at 401; AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 339 at [44]-[55]; McVittie v R [2015] NSWCCA 92 at [36]; Colville v R [2015] NSWCCA 149; 71 MVR 259 at [29]. See also the discussions (obiter) in Clarke v R [2015] NSWCCA 232 and Turnbull v Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage [2015] NSWCCA 278 at [26]-[36].
	
	
	Mr Chiang appears to contend that his Honour was required to sentence him upon a characterisation of the facts most favourable to him. His Honour was not required to do so: Filippou v The Queen [2015] HCA 29; 89 ALJR 776 at [5]. In the not dissimilar case in this Court of R v Holden [2014] NSWCCA 230 at [26]-[27] Harrison J commented as follows:
	


“[26] The Crown emphasised that it was significant that his Honour sat as the tribunal of fact and had the important advantage of hearing and observing the applicant in the witness box. That advantage was the same as that enjoyed by juries to which the authorities predominantly refer. However, in the present case, the evidence did not in my view even produce a doubt that required deference to the trial judge's special advantage. The evidence promoted by the applicant did not point in only one direction or produce the conclusion that the trial just must have entertained a reasonable doubt. On the contrary, the factors highlighted by the applicant were at best colourable. In other words, none of them either alone or in combination necessarily points only or even persuasively to the conclusion that the applicant acquired the drugs for his personal use or ‘otherwise than for supply’. Such a conclusion is arguable but no more than that. In the events that occurred, his Honour did not accept the applicant's explanation of the circumstances in which or the purposes for which he acquired the drugs. His Honour was perfectly entitled to reach that conclusion.

[27] That is particularly so having regard to the fact that many of the matters upon which the applicant relied do not speak for themselves, but are dependent upon acceptance of the applicant as a witness of truth. The fact that there was no evidence that directly contradicted the applicant's version of events does not equate to proof by him on the balance of probabilities that he possessed the drugs otherwise than for supply. The burden of the applicant's submission is in effect that his uncontradicted evidence had to be accepted by his Honour and that he fell into error by not doing so. That general proposition is not, and for obvious reasons could not be, correct. His Honour rejected the applicant's evidence for the reasons that he gave. His Honour fell into no error by doing so.”


	
	In our opinion, the same can be said of the sentencing judge in this case. He was not bound to believe Mr Chiang and was entitled to disbelieve him. His Honour’s finding that the evidence was vague or lacking specificity was limited to Mr Chiang’s evidence about his possession of the pills and his intended use and supply. That was a finding that was reasonably open on the evidence. His Honour was perfectly entitled to be sceptical about Mr Chiang’s evidence that he had an arrangement with unnamed friends of unspecified number centred on a loose reciprocal agreement among them.
	
	
	The finding that the evidence was self-serving and uncorroborated is unassailable. It is not a proper basis upon which to criticise his Honour to suggest that the frailties in Mr Chiang’s evidence were explicable having regard to the fact that he did not wish to identify or incriminate his friends. His Honour would undoubtedly have appreciated that fact, but he was not bound as a consequence any more readily to accept Mr Chiang’s evidence, and Mr Chiang bore the onus by reference to proper evidence of satisfying his Honour in this respect.
	
	
	His Honour was similarly not obliged to accept that Mr Chiang's mother had ""the financial means to support him in all aspects of his life including the purchase of illegal drugs"". Proof of that proposition would have at least required some evidence, presumably from her. His Honour fell into no error by declining to accept a submission, based only upon an unsupported inference that money for the purchase of the pills came from a legitimate source.
	
	
	Finally, again in the absence of evidence touching the issue from anyone other than Mr Chiang, his Honour was perfectly entitled to reject a submission that Mr Chiang intended to ingest ten of the pills that evening by himself. His Honour fell into no identifiable error by concluding that the arrangement that Mr Chiang said he had with his friends was unlikely or that his evidence about his intentions concerning personal use of the pills was untrue. The conflict between the account he apparently gave to the author of the Pre-Sentence Report and his evidence at the sentence hearing did not inspire confidence in Mr Chiang's credibility on such topics.
	
	
	This ground of appeal distils to a proposition that his Honour was not in the particular circumstances of this case entitled to reject Mr Chiang’s evidence. His Honour, on the contrary, was completely entitled to do so. The assessment of witnesses is the daily fare of judges. The conclusions reached cannot be successfully challenged unless it can be shown that his Honour proceeded erroneously to exercise the relevant discretion. Mr Chiang has not demonstrated that his Honour did so here.
	


Ground 2


	
	In Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [46], Simpson J (as her Honour then was) said this about the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence:
	


“[46] The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.”


	
	The same can be said about this Court's approach to a complaint that a sentence is manifestly excessive: the role of the first instance judge should never be underestimated and it is not a matter for this Court to trespass upon his or her function by simply substituting its own view as to the appropriate sentence. Moreover, manifest excess has to be established having regard to the fact that there is no single correct sentence. Sentencing judges are afforded flexibility in the exercise of their sentencing discretion that is constrained only by the requirement that they correctly apply applicable principle. Generally, see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.
	
	
	Mr Chiang uncontroversially accepted that in order to establish that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive, he would have to establish that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen [2005] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325.
	
	
	In support of that contention Mr Chiang submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence was not high. No aggravating circumstances were found. There was no profit motive connected with the offence. The quantity of MDMA was 5.68 percent of the maximum amount before the drug would have been classed as a commercial quantity. We observe that it was also almost ten times the prescribed traffickable quantity.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Chiang submitted that he had a strong subjective case, being a young man of 25 years of age with only a minor criminal history, no part of which relevantly informed the sentencing exercise in this case. Mr Chiang was in the third year of an undergraduate degree in business and commerce at Western Sydney University. He lived at home with his mother. His parents divorced when he was very young. He had never been sentenced to a term of imprisonment before and he had good prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Chiang had also expressed what his Honour concluded was genuine contrition and remorse.
	
	
	Mr Chiang also drew attention to statistics for sentencing in relation to offences against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Putting aside some no doubt inadvertent misinterpretation of them in the written submissions, the statistics currently available indicate that out of 740 offenders who were sentenced in the seven years up to September 2015, only 127 or 17 percent received a full-time custodial sentence. Where the offender was sentenced for no other offence at the same time, 42 out of 463 (or 9 percent) received full-time imprisonment. Where a plea of guilty was entered (in the vast majority of cases) the proportions are the same. Mr Chiang thus submitted that his Honour’s sentence represented a departure from both the pattern and level of sentences in similar cases.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised in response that Mr Chiang’s counsel conceded before his Honour on two occasions that the offence was sufficiently serious to warrant a sentence of imprisonment. The significance of that concession however needs to be qualified by recognition of the fact that argument below focussed upon the question of whether or not a suspended sentence should be imposed. The Crown referred to the fact that numerous judicial observations have referred to the fact that a suspended sentence will not be appropriate where the court declares that the offence in question is one where the element of general deterrence is of particular importance: the written submissions cited R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49]; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32]; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286 at [35]. In this case his Honour specifically commented that “general deterrence [was] necessary to signal to persons taking drugs into music festivals or dance parties for supply to their friends or otherwise [that they] will meet with severe punishment.”
	
	
	There is no doubt in our view that his Honour proceeded thereafter in line with that comment to punish Mr Chiang severely. It is true that his Honour extended Mr Chiang the generosity of a favourable finding of special circumstances having regard to what his Honour considered to be unresolved drug issues requiring assistance and rehabilitation following his release. His Honour had clearly not, however, been prepared to accede to Mr Chiang’s submissions that a suspended sentence was appropriate. We note in passing that it could not be said in all of the circumstances of the case that such a result would have been manifestly inadequate, particularly having regard to Mr Chiang’s strong subjective circumstances.
	
	
	It was plainly his Honour’s view, in light of his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, taken in conjunction with the need for general deterrence, and having regard to the maximum penalty which included 15 years imprisonment, that a custodial sentence was warranted. We agree that a full-time custodial sentence was called for.
	
	
	However, we are also of the view that the starting point of 2 years before reduction on account of Mr Chiang's early plea of guilty was excessive. Mr Chiang was a relatively young man with no significant criminal history. He was co-operative with police, pleaded guilty at an early stage and was found to be genuinely contrite with good prospects of rehabilitation. Further, while his Honour rejected Mr Chiang's account, he was also not prepared to find that the proposed supply of the drugs had any financial motivation. A significantly lesser starting point for the sentence was appropriate and would still serve the purposes of deterrence, both general and personal.
	
	
	We are mindful of the other purposes of punishment listed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which include promoting the rehabilitation of the offender. His Honour accepted that Mr Chiang had unresolved drug issues. His Honour accepted the evidence that Mr Chiang had experienced depression, anxiety and mood swings since his arrest and was on a waiting list to see a psychologist. His Honour also considered that despite his evidence that he had ceased using drugs, there remained ""unresolved drug issues"".
	
	
	We accept the unchallenged assessment of the primary judge that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. We consider that the appropriate term of the sentence is 12 months which should be reduced to 9 months on account of the early plea of guilty. We do not consider that suspension of such sentence is appropriate in all of the circumstances. There should be a finding of special circumstances but only to the extent that would see Mr Chiang released on parole forthwith.
	


Orders


	
	We make the following orders:
	



	
	Application for leave to appeal granted and the appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court on 2 October 2015 and in lieu thereof sentence Mr Chiang to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of term of 3 months. The sentence is to date from 2 October 2015. The non-parole period expires on 1 April 2016 and the total term expires on 1 July 2016. The Court directs the release of Mr Chiang on parole forthwith.

		01 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701845,Regina v Blanks [2016] NSWSC 361,"Judgment

(A) Introduction


	
	The accused, Judith Thelma Blanks, is charged on indictment that on 15 January 2012 at Wondabyne in the State of New South Wales, she did murder Shayne MacDonald. To that charge the accused is taken to have pleaded not guilty: s 21(3)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”).
	
	
	On 25 May 2015, his Honour RS Hulme AJ found the accused unfit to be tried.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 16 of the Act the Mental Health Tribunal notified the Court that the accused would not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offence. In those circumstances the Court is required to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable: s 19(1)(b) of the Act.
	
	
	The purpose of a special hearing is to ensure, despite the unfitness of the accused to be tried in accordance with normal procedures, that he or she is acquitted unless it can be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged or any available alternative offence: s 19(2) of the Act.
	
	
	By s 21(1) of the Act, a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as it if were a trial of criminal proceedings.
	
	
	The special hearing commenced on 15 February 2016 and continued on 16, 17, 24 and 26 February 2016. The accused was arraigned on the first day of the hearing and, as stated above, is taken to have pleaded not guilty to the charge.
	
	
	It is necessary that I take into account, consistent with the provisions of s 21(4) of the Act, that the accused person is unfit to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures having regard to the meaning of “unfitness to be tried”, as well as the purpose of the special hearing, the verdicts that are available, and the legal and practical consequences of such verdicts.
	
	
	In accordance with s 21A(1) of the Act, at a special hearing the question of whether the accused person has committed an offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to an offence charged, is to be determined by a judge alone unless an election to have a special hearing determined by a jury has been made. There has not been an election in this case and therefore in accordance with the provisions of s 21A(1) the proceedings are to be determined by me.
	
	
	In accordance with s 21B(1) of the Act the verdicts available to a judge who determines a special hearing without a jury are the verdicts available to a jury under s 22 of the Act. Such a verdict has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.
	
	
	Section 22 of the Act sets out the verdicts available to the jury or to c Court at a special hearing.
	


(B) Overview


	
	The accused and the deceased as at 15 January 2012 had been in a relationship for about six months. In the weeks preceding the deceased’s death, they had been living an itinerant lifestyle in a tent at Wondabyne which is located in a relatively remote area of the Brisbane Waters National Park. That area is only accessible by boat, train or via the Great North Walk. The accused and the deceased had set up a camp approximately 20m from the nearby railway station.
	
	
	The Crown alleges that on 15 January 2012, the accused was cutting up vegetables for an evening meal when the deceased entered the tent and an argument ensued. The Crown case is that when the accused threatened the deceased at this time she was holding a knife and lashed out at him in an upwards motion from her seated position, stabbing him in the upper left thigh.
	
	
	The medical evidence established that the deceased suffered a stab wound which severed the femoral artery and vein and the deceased bled to death.
	


(C) The Elements of the Offence


	
	The Crown has the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of the offence of murder. The elements of that offence are:
	



	
	That the victim died;
	
	
	That the act or omission of the accused caused the death of the victim;
	
	
	That the act of the accused was without lawful cause or excuse; and
	
	
	The act or omission causing death was done by the accused with the intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm to the victim.
	



	
	It is fundamental that the accused has the benefit of the presumption of innocence, that is to say, she is to be presumed to be innocent of the charge brought against her or any available alternative charge unless and until the Crown has discharged its onus of proof as I have stated.
	
	
	Ms Chrissa Loukas SC who appeared on behalf of the accused submitted that, on the evidence, the Crown has not proven the offence of murder beyond reasonable doubt. The accused’s account to police was that as the deceased walked towards the tent, he tripped and fell onto a log where she had rested a knife which was facing upwards, on her side of the log.
	
	
	The evidence in the Crown case consisted of both documentary and oral evidence.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a folder of documents entitled “Crown Materials” which was marked as Exhibit A. The index to the tender volume (Exhibit A) provides a witness list in which the names of 24 witnesses are set out, identifying notes, crime scene photographs and written statements of the witnesses. The statement of witness number 5, Detective Senior Constable Melanie Leaity, had three attachments, including an ERISP transcript with the accused, a summary of the accused’s diary and a summary of ‘help point’ and CCTV records.
	
	
	A copy of the report on autopsy by Dr Beer dated 11 April 2012, was contained within Exhibit A at Tab 22.
	
	
	Exhibit A also contains copies of the Dr Macintosh’s Biomechanical Reports regarding the death of Shayne MacDonald dated 17 January 2013 and 2 August 2013. The First Report is at Tab 21A of Exhibit A. The Second Report is at Tab 24B. Photographs of the log and knife are at Tab 24C of Exhibit A.
	


(D) The Evidence of Mr MacRitchie and Mr Jones


	
	The Crown relied upon the statements and oral evidence of Mr Ben MacRitchie (Exhibit A, Tab 15) and his friend Mr Chris Jones (Exhibit A, Tab 14), both having travelled on the Sunday, 15 January 2012 together on a fishing trip to the Wondabyne area.
	


(i) Evidence of Mr MacRitchie


	
	Mr MacRitchie in his statement, stated that he and Mr Jones arrived at Wondabyne station at approximately 12:30pm on 15 January 2012. They walked straight to the wharf which is only 15m from the train platform. He said that they walked along the wharf and he saw a lady sitting down at the end of the walkway. He said that she did not appear to be in a happy mood as she didn’t talk to them. Within a minute of them arriving, she got up and walked back to the other side of the railway lines near the bush.
	
	
	Sometime afterwards he heard a woman, later identified as the accused, swearing at her male companion (the deceased). He said she said “Fuck off” as she was yelling at him.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie and Mr Jones continued fishing for at least an hour until it started to rain and they walked to a shelter on the train platform. When standing there, Mr MacRitchie noticed the accused sitting on the ground next to a tank which looked like a water tank.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie said that soon after he walked through a path in the bush behind them to go to the toilet. He said that he came across a campsite which was set up only 10-20m into the bush. He came across the deceased sitting on the ground underneath a tarp at the campsite. He said he looked in his mid-30s. There were a few clothes lying around. He said to him, “Hello. It’s lovely weather isn’t it.” The male simply replied “No, it isn’t.”
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie did not stop but kept walking another 10m or so to the toilet in the bush. A few moments later he returned and passed the campsite on the same track. He said he saw the deceased still sitting at the campsite. He did not say anything to him and continued walking to the train platform.
	
	
	After the rain eased off, Mr MacRitchie and Mr Jones resumed fishing. Mr MacRitchie said that while they were on the platform he again heard the accused yelling. He said it sounded like she was having an argument with the deceased, whom he had seen at the campsite. He said that she was doing most of the yelling. He could not hear everything she said, but definitely heard her say “Putrid dog”. He also heard her yelling “Fuck” a lot. He could hear the male voice talking with her. That voice seemed a lot quieter than hers and was not yelling. He did hear him at one point say “fuck off”, but didn’t hear what else he said. He said the yelling seemed like it was going on most of the afternoon. The volume would go up and then it would go quiet again. He did not see where they were as he was trying not to pay attention. He said he knew it was the same female that he had seen sitting on the pontoon and the male at the campsite as there was no one else around.
	
	
	The rain started again and Mr MacRitchie and Mr Jones took shelter on the railway platform.
	
	
	He remembers that at about that time, the accused was talking on the emergency phone on the eastern side of the railway platform and he heard her say whilst on the phone, “He’s cut himself”. He did not see where the accused went after this.
	
	
	He thought it was around 4:00pm when the rain started to ease off and he and Mr Jones decided to get some oysters. A short time later a male voice was heard talking over the emergency phone asking, “Is anyone there? How far away from the train station is the injured person?”.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie then started talking to the male on the emergency phone and told him that the injured person was about 10m away. He said that as he was talking he saw the accused running down from the campsite in the bush and she said, “He’s not moving”.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie ran with the accused back to the campsite. He immediately saw the deceased lying on his back on the ground near the tent. His head was raised up on a bag. He looked very pale and his lips looked blue. He said to the accused, “What happened?”. He said that she said, “He fell over a log onto a knife”.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie said that he then saw a round log on the ground lying in the dirt pathway. It was only a metre from the lower left side of the body. The log was about a foot long and 8 inches in diameter. The log appeared to be right in the middle of the pathway. He said it was not on the pathway when he walked through to go to the toilet earlier.
	
	
	He noticed a lot of blood and there was a white cloth on the deceased’s left thigh, the size of a tea towel.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie started doing chest compressions by placing two hands on the chest. He said that he got the accused to do breaths into the mouth as he did the compressions. He said, “She was jumping in a bit early for each breath, but she did seem a bit hysterical. I could hear gurgling sounds coming from him when I did the compressions”: Mr MacRitchie’s Statement 18 January 2012 at [18].
	
	
	He later said that a female train guard arrived and started doing some chest compressions.
	
	
	Mr MacRitchie was called to give evidence at the special hearing on 16 February 2016. In general terms his evidence was consistent with the contents of his written statement. The limited cross-examination was directed only to clarifying and confirming the identity of the female to which he had referred in his statement ([15]) a reference to the accused.
	


(ii) The Evidence of Mr Jones


	
	Mr Jones’ statement to police is dated 18 January 2012 a copy of which is behind Tab 14 of Exhibit A. In general terms his evidence as to his observations, in particular relating to the accused, was consistent with those of Mr MacRitchie.
	
	
	He gave an account of having spent time on the afternoon of 15 January 2012 fishing for mud crabs and oysters and that the female to which he referred, the accused, sat in the nearby location to where they were fishing for a period over three or four hours. He said he saw a male (the deceased) walk down from time to time to talk to the accused. When he did so he heard her yelling at him saying, “Fuck off, fuck off you dog cunt”. He saw the deceased walk back behind the railway platform into the bush at some point. He said that each time the deceased approached the accused she would yell at him: Statement at [8].
	
	
	Later in the day he saw the deceased come down, they spoke about the weather and the deceased then walked back to his tent.
	
	
	After waiting twenty to thirty minutes until the rain stopped, he and Mr MacRitchie went back to the pontoon. He again heard the accused swearing. He said that it sounded like her yelling “was coming from where the campsite was set up”. He could not hear the male voice saying anything: Statement at [11].
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Mr Jones said that after the rain stopped he and Mr MacRitchie were tossing up as to whether to go home as they were soaking wet. He said at this point he heard the female yelling out, but this time she was back at the campsite: T 63:30-35.
	
	
	He said he heard yelling and screaming by the female at the male similar to what had been going on in that respect for some hours. He said the yelling appeared to come from the campsite: T 63:40-45. He could not hear the male saying anything; he was still quiet at that stage.
	
	
	A short time after that, that is, five to ten minutes later, he was asked if he heard the female from somewhere else on the platform. Mr Jones said that he did and that she had gone to the emergency phone and made a call. He heard her say, more or less “He’s fallen over on a log and hurt himself”: T 64:1-5.
	
	
	Mr Jones said that he and Mr MacRitchie decided to go down to get oysters. He said he heard the deceased yelling something at some stage but he said to Mr MacRitchie that he did not want to go back to see what was wrong and that they should mind their own business: T 64:25-30.
	
	
	He said that as they walked from the platform to fetch oysters he heard the deceased say, “You’ve got to get this out of here, you’ve got to get this out of me, you’ve got to get this out of me”. He said he then heard, “You’ve got to clean this mess up” or “You’ve got to clean this up”. He said he thought the accused had spilled something. He said he did not hear the accused say anything to the deceased in response: T 65:1-6.
	
	
	Mr Jones said he tried not to pay any attention at this stage because the accused had been yelling abuse at the deceased all day. He said he couldn’t tell if she was upset at the time of talking on the emergency phone because he could not see her face.
	
	
	He said after twenty minutes of collecting oysters he heard Mr MacRitchie call out twice and he knew something was wrong. He said that he went to the campsite and it was a “horrific scene” with blood everywhere. He said he saw the deceased lying down face up near the front of a tent. He saw Mr MacRitchie doing chest compressions. The deceased appeared to be unconscious and looked dead. He said the accused was not saying a word: T 66:15-20.
	
	
	Mr Jones was asked in the course of his evidence as to observations he had made when he saw the deceased earlier walking down to the water tank and then returning to the camp. In the period he made the observations he said the deceased did this three or four times. When asked if he noted anything about his gait or style of walking he said, “He seemed quite normal”: T 70:15-20. When asked whether he heard the deceased saying anything to the accused, he said “He was so quiet, I don’t think he was trying to make a scene and she was the one being loud and abusive”: T 70:20-25.
	
	
	There was no cross-examination of Mr Jones.
	


(E) The Evidence of Ms Annette Whitelum


	
	Annette Whitelum had been completing the Great North Walk on 15 January 2012. As she approached Wondabyne she could hear people talking from the track and she saw a couple of tents near the train station. She said that when she was waiting for the train she was talking to a girl when a southbound train stopped. She said that a male and female got off the train and crossed the tracks and walked towards her. On the Crown case this was a reference to the accused and the deceased. Ms Whitelum said that the deceased was carrying a bag with beer inside and the female was carrying a big handbag. She said the deceased mumbled something and laughed at a comment. The deceased and accused walked to the first campsite which was the tent with the tarp covering it.
	
	
	She gave a description of the deceased and the accused. Whilst waiting on the train platform she could see that the two had opened a bottle of beer each. She said that in her opinion they were both drunk. This, she said, was based on the way they spoke to each other. When they were talking, the deceased was talking quietly and the accused was rough and loud, and swearing. She said that they seemed to get into an argument and the deceased appeared to be trying to stop the argument.
	
	
	Soon after they arrived at the campsite she saw the accused smoking a bong and from the aroma coming from the bong, she believed the accused was smoking cannabis: Statement 16 January 2012, (Exhibit A, Tab 13 at [11]). She said that she noted that the deceased was walking in and out of the tent and trying to get the accused into the tent but that she did not want to go and they then started having more heated discussion again. She said that she saw the deceased come out and try to physically pick the accused up and lead her into the tent but that she resisted and continued to argue. She said that the deceased said, “I’m gonna do you in”. She heard the accused reply something like, “Well I’ll fucking stab you and tip your beer over”. She said that the threat to tip his beer over seemed to really upset the deceased. She said that he was not raising his voice in the argument, but she had “a real trashy voice and swore a lot which made her seem more aggressive than him”: Statement at [12].
	
	
	She said that the argument seemed then to defuse itself and they were talking nicely to each other. The accused continued to smoke out of the bong. Soon after the northbound train arrived. As it arrived she could hear the deceased and the accused starting to argue again. She caught the train at 1:44pm to Lisarow: Statement at [13].
	
	
	In cross-examination, in particular in relation to para [12] of her statement, she agreed that in her statement she told police that the deceased said “something like” – “I’m going to do you in” and similarly she told police that the accused replied “something like” – “Well, I’ll fucking stab you and tip your beer over you”.
	


(F) The Accused’s Version of Events


	
	The police conducted an electronically recorded interview with the accused commencing at 12:36am on 16 January 2012. The interview was conducted by Detective Senior Constable Melanie Leaity and Senior Constable Andrew Jeffery.
	
	
	The accused stated in the interview that she was inside the tent getting some food out for dinner when she:
	


“… heard the knife snap against the log that was sitting there and just tripped over and fell on top of it”: (Q/A 40)


	
	Subsequently she said that she was preparing food for dinner and obtained the knife from the tent: (Q/A 250). Once she got the knife she then said that she “…sat it out there against the, up against the log thing, we’ve got like two logs that we were using as a chair”: (Q/A 252).
	
	
	She said that the log was not far away from the tent: (Q/A 255, 256).
	
	
	The accused said that she had the knife sitting up against the log: (Q/A 258). and that it was on the side of the log closer to the tent: (Q/A 259).
	
	
	She told police that the deceased had walked away from the tent to a nearby cave and then he walked back towards the tent: (Q/A 266-273).
	
	
	The accused said that the deceased did not say anything to her and that she was just sitting inside the tent: (Q/A 274-5).
	
	
	She said that all she heard was him fall (Q/A 276). The accused added that she heard him trip on something and he said “Ouch” and that he fell frontwards (that is face down) and then rolled over onto his back after he fell: (Q/A 281).
	
	
	The accused told police that the deceased, “… just fell straight on top of the log actually”: (Q/A 287).
	
	
	The accused described the knife as being a blue coloured knife. It was brand new and it was a sharp steel knife: (Q/A 291-4).
	


(G) The Relationship Between the Deceased and the Accused


	
	As noted above, the accused and the deceased had been in a relationship for approximately six months. The evidence indicates that they were both alcoholics and that they had consumed alcohol during the day on 15 January 2012. The deceased had also ingested Tramadol, a narcotic.
	
	
	During the course of the hearing, Ms Loukas SC on behalf of the accused, challenged the admissibility of relationship evidence observing in her written outline of submissions dated 22 February 2016 (para [2]) that the admission of relationship evidence is governed by a combination of the common law and the general exclusionary provisions of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	On 23 February 2016 I made a ruling that the evidence of relationship was admissible as context or as relationship evidence, but that it could not be used as tendency or coincidence evidence. The essential basis for the objection to the admissibility of the evidence was that there was a danger that the evidence may be misused. On 26 February 2016, Ms Loukas noted my reference in the reasons for the ruling on relationship evidence to the fact that no submissions had been made for its exclusion on a discretionary basis under either ss 135 or 137. Ms Loukas drew attention to the fact that those provisions were referred to in para [2] of her written submissions. That said, the essential basis upon which it was submitted that the evidence should not be admitted was the risk of its misuse as either tendency or propensity evidence. In my ruling I acknowledged the need to self-direct on the principles governing the admission of relationship evidence.
	
	
	The evidence established that the relationship was a tempestuous one in that the accused and the deceased were often verbally abusive to one another with the accused having been seen on a number of occasions (including on the day of the deceased’s death) as being the more aggressive of the two. In addition to Mr MacRitchie and Mr Jones, a number of witnesses said they saw the deceased and the accused on 15 January 2012. They gave evidence of hearing the accused verbally attack the deceased on a number of occasions, swearing at him in a loud and aggressive manner.
	
	
	Evidence was called in the Crown case as to the nature of the relationship between the accused and the deceased prior to the stabbing incident on 15 January 2012. Mr Mark Eason provided a statement to police dated 16 January 2012 (Exhibit A, Tab 18).
	
	
	Mr Eason’s partner, Ms Hendrickson, resided at the Wondabyne Caretaker’s Cottage. The residence was some 20m from Wondabyne station. He gave evidence of having noted the presence of the accused and the deceased at various times throughout 2011. He said that their presence was transient and that they would turn up for three to five days and then be gone three or four weeks. He said that quite often he would hear the accused swearing and abusing the deceased. He said he did not really hear much come from the deceased: at [5].
	
	
	He said about a month before making his statement he was coming off the jetty after fishing and he saw the accused sitting next to the communication box and he heard her swearing at the deceased. On another occasion he saw the accused walking along the southbound train line carrying a frying pan, yelling out to the deceased: at [7].
	
	
	He said that he often heard the accused from the house in a drunken slur yelling out and swearing at the deceased. He said he had never heard much out of the deceased. He said it was a common thing and he would just put some music on so that he could not hear any more: at [8].
	
	
	There was evidence of two prior incidents involving violent episodes between the accused and the deceased. The deceased’s mother, Ms Margaret Ann MacDonald, provided a statement to police dated 19 February 2012. She also gave oral evidence. She was not cross-examined.
	
	
	In her statement to Queensland Police (Exhibit A, Tab 21) Ms MacDonald said that the deceased used to drink and she thought he had a problem with alcohol and that he was an alcoholic who drank most days, mostly as a beer drinker. She described him as a happy drunk: at [11]. She said she never saw him get cranky or angry while drinking.
	
	
	Ms MacDonald said that her son also took drugs at various times and had smoked marijuana most of his adult life: at [12].
	
	
	She gave evidence of an occasion on 11 December 2011 when she picked up her son outside the Ormeau shopping centre. She noticed that he had some scratches on the left side of his face and neck. She said that the scratches looked like someone had scratched him with their fingernails: at [29]. She spoke to him about these observations. She said that he told her that he had been camping with the accused and that she was cooking at the time with a frying pan over the camp stove when, on his account, she threw the fry pan full of food at him. She said he lifted his shirt and showed her a welt across his ribs on his right side towards his back.
	
	
	Ms MacDonald said that on that occasion the deceased said that he picked up a lid of a butter container and flicked it towards the accused and hit her on the lip causing a small cut to her top lip. On his version, the accused then lunged at him and scratched him in the face and neck with her fingernails. He said he then packed up his gear and left her and came to his mother’s home.
	
	
	Ms Rebecca Mulheran, a neighbour of Ms MacDonald, gave a statement to police on 19 February 2012 in which she referred to an incident involving the accused.
	
	
	In her statement, Ms Mulheran said that she was out in the front yard with her daughter when she heard loud swearing from a female voice. She looked across the street and saw the deceased and a lady, suggested as having been the accused, standing in the driveway to Ms MacDonald’s house. She said that she could see the accused was swinging her arms around and lashing out towards the deceased. She said that it looked to her as though the accused was trying to scratch his face and his body with her fingernails. She said it looked very violent to her and the accused appeared “very vicious”: at [12]. She said that the deceased appeared a bit scared as he was backing away from the accused down the driveway. Ms Mulheran said that the accused continued swearing loudly at the deceased. She was considering whether or not to call the police but then saw the deceased with his arms around the accused and they were both walking into the garage: at [16]. It appeared to her that the dispute had settled down a bit so she went inside with her daughter.
	
	
	Ms Mulheran also gave evidence at the hearing. She was not cross-examined.
	


(H) The Autopsy Performed by Dr Beer


	
	An autopsy was performed on the deceased at the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine by Dr Brian Beer, Senior Staff Specialist in Forensic Pathology at 8:30am on 17 January 2012. Dr Beer’s observations and findings are set out in his Report dated 11 April 2012 a copy of which, as I have earlier indicated, is included in Exhibit A. He was called to give evidence. He was an impressive witness.
	
	
	Dr Beer noted the evidence of injury, namely, a stab wound located in the upper inner medial aspect of the deceased’s left thigh. The wound, he said, penetrated through the muscles and soft tissues of the thigh severing the left femoral artery and vein 60mm deep from the skin entry point. The wound extended for a further 35mm into muscle and fat beyond the transected artery and vein.
	
	
	The cause of death Dr Beer stated was the massive blood loss secondary to the femoral artery and vein being transected by the stab wound.
	
	
	A knife, similar to the blue knife that caused the injury was stated by Dr Beer to measure 37mm wide at its maximum width and 150mm from the tip to the hilt. As I will discuss, a noteworthy fact was that the wound was also 37 mm wide with a maximum depth of 95mm and was consistent with having been caused by such a knife. Dr Beer referred to it as a “neat” wound.
	
	
	Dr Beer noted that the wound penetrated through the muscles and soft tissues of the thigh severing the left femoral artery and vein 60mm deep from the skin entry point and 250mm from the iliac artery bifurcation. A finding of particular importance related to the trajectory of the knife wound. Dr Beer described the wound track as left to right, front to back and downwards and upwards at an approximate angle of 45 degrees.
	
	
	Dr Beer in [6] of his report stated:
	


“In the Police summary P79A, the proffered explanation from Blanks as to how this incident occurred, was that the deceased stumbled and fell onto the knife. While the dynamics of this occurring cannot be totally excluded this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the autopsy findings, and is not particularly plausible.”


	
	As to the last part of that sentence, Dr Beer in oral evidence stated that any experienced forensic pathologist will always say that you can never say “always” because in his field of work the unusual can occasionally, very rarely, occur, and that “… without good witness evidence of what’s going on, it is sometimes difficult to totally exclude propositions”: T 111:30-36.
	
	
	In cross-examination he agreed that he had said in his autopsy report (para [6]) that the scenario of the deceased stumbling and falling onto the knife could not be totally excluded. He confirmed that in forensic matters he will never say “never” and never say “always”, “strange things do happen” and that though he could not totally exclude the possibility, on the level of probability, he had issues with the accused’s suggested scenario: T 120:5-17.
	
	
	Dr Beer proceeded:
	


“The issue I have with this particular case, and it really revolves around the angle of the trajectory of the knife wound, is to explain how that occurred given the scenario. Had the deceased fallen directly onto the log and the knife as has been put to me in this, I would have expected the initial entry point, the wound, would have been either horizontal into the thigh or actually hitting downwards somewhat …” (T 111:35-45)


	
	The doctor indicated a reference to horizontal position to his own thigh by way of explanation of his evidence. He then continued:
	


“A:   Or it would have been perhaps slightly downwards heading towards the knee (indicating). That is why I would have expected out of a direct fall onto the knife in the way it has been proposed. Had there been movement going forwards the very neat way the wound was and you can see at post mortem, there would have been a lot of movement of that knife. Had it gone in perpendicular and gone upwards we would have seen – we wouldn’t have seen the nice shelved appearance to it …” (T 112:5-15)


	
	When asked to explain what he meant by the word “shelved” and whether it meant the actual look of the wound itself, which had the look of a shelf to it, Dr Beer responded:
	


“A:   Yes, it’s got a nice shelf going upwards in a certain direction. So I found it difficult to explain that dynamic, how he managed to get a knife wound that was going up at 45 degrees angles towards the groin, and to me that is the essence of this case. I find it very difficult to explain that and given that scenario, perhaps if the person had stumbled going forwards and gone to his knees, again no evidence to suggest that from the autopsy, I cannot see how the thigh would have been impacted in that sort of way.” (T 112:15-25)


	
	Dr Beer confirmed in his oral evidence that the knife had travelled up the leg. By reference to photograph 3 in Exhibit G, Dr Beer described the upwards movement of the knife: T 106:20-30.
	
	
	Photograph 49 was said to give an indication of the angle at which the knife had gone up as indicated by the trajectory of the wound: T 106:40-46.
	


The Absence of Bruising or Abrasions


	
	There was no bruising or abrasions detected on autopsy in the area of the legs, in particular in the thigh and hip areas, consistent with the deceased having fallen on the log: T 109:1-10. Dr Beer was taken to the photographs in Exhibit A, Tab C, Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5, being photographs of the log found outside the tent that had been used by the accused and the deceased. He said it would have been a reasonable proposition to have expected, given inter alia the dimensions of the log, that there would have been some sort of injury to the body of the deceased by falling upon the log: T 110:5-10. He referred in this respect to abrasions and bruising.
	
	
	Dr Beer gave evidence in relation to two diagrams which he prepared showing a stick figure depicting a situation where a person had fallen over the log: T 115. He stated that if a person fell and hit the damp earth then no sign of injury would be feasible. If, however, the person fell and hit something hard such as a log, then he would expect that as a result of impact there would be bruising and some surface abrasion or loss to the skin: T 115:6. He said that none of that existed in this case.
	
	
	Dr Beer agreed that if the deceased had fallen straight onto the knife, that is he lurched forward and went down to the knife with his head forward of the log and heavily impacted with the log, he would expect there to have been some damage to his body: T 110:10-16.
	
	
	In the course of his evidence Dr Beer said that bruising on the left knee detected at autopsy was an old, and not a “current” injury: T 110:25-30. The bruising to the medial aspect of the left foot above the ankle was also an old bruise.
	


Evidence of Dr Beer Disputing the Accused’s Account of the Incident


	
	In relation to photographs 2, 3 and 4 of Exhibit C, Dr Beer noted that the knife was shown in the photographs positioned at different angles. They clearly show the shape of the base of the knife as well as the top part of it projecting above the log at the different angles: T 118:15-20.
	
	
	In relation to the accused’s account of the incident, Dr Beer stated that if the knife was located as shown in the photographs and somebody stumbled on the log then the initial trajectory of the knife, if it was upright, would have been such that it would have “gone straight in”. This I note is consistent with his evidence as to horizontal entry point: see para [90] above. He said in that event there would not have been any shelving going upwards as he had observed it on autopsy: T 118:20-25.
	
	
	When asked to confirm that it would have been horizontal to his thigh, Dr Beer added:
	


“A.   Or it would have been perhaps slightly downwards heading towards the knee (indicating).


	
	Dr Beer’s evidence in this regard emphasises the significance of the findings as to a “neat” entry to the wound, the upwards tract of the wound and the shelving as all consistent with a single stab wound and inconsistent with a trip and fall forwards onto the knife.
	
	
	On the accused’s version of events, if the knife was in the resting‑back or inclined position as shown in photograph 3, then Dr Beer said he would have expected the initial trajectory would have actually shown the shelving going downwards on the leg (that is, I observe, opposite to the wound found on autopsy). If on that version allowance was made for movement in the knife, then Dr Beer said:
	


“… I think that would have destroyed or upset the nice neat shelving that we have seen. You can appreciate that if you have got movement like that there’s going to be movement of that knife in there and I wouldn’t have seen such a nice neat entry to it.” (T 118:30-35)


	
	Dr Beer was then asked by the Crown to have regard to the evidence, including the photograph showing the actual knife in position behind the log from where the deceased came towards the log. On the scenario that he had fallen, on the version of the accused, onto the knife and the log, he was asked and gave answers as follows:
	


“Q.   Which would have been behind the log from where he was now from that angle, for a start, Doctor, the wound you would expect would be horizontal as he fell on the knife?

A.   The initial in point I would have thought would be horizontal, and had he gone forward, we would not see this very nice clean shelved appearance and the actual width of the wound would have been, I would have thought, wider than what we see.

Q.   Why would you have thought it would be wider than the actual knife with the shelf?

A.   Because there would be movement of the knife and the wound.

Q.   So it wouldn’t be a clean stab wound, so to speak, it would be moving around?

A.   Correct.

Q.   As the base of the knife was not held firm, is that right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Indeed, the base of the knife would have moved, given its positioning as, on this scenario, the deceased fell on it, is that right?

A.   Correct. And also I would have thought to my way of thinking that if that occurred and the knife had – sorry, the log had rolled forward as it would do with the momentum of the body, the knife wouldn’t continue on going forwards, it would actually be pulled out and you wouldn’t have got the depth that we saw.

Q.   And, indeed, if the deceased fell onto the log and the knife, you would expect the log would indeed, if it moved, would move in the same direction that is forward, would it not?

A.   Correct, yes.

Q.   And that would place the knife in the situation where it would be either further upright or in fact, pointing backwards so to speak, is that right?

A.   In part. Again, in this scenario it is difficult to make a precise dynamic how that knife would have gone, but I cannot see that that knife would have been thrust upwards at 45 degrees that the depth that it got to.” (T 113:1-25)


	
	Dr Beer confirmed that he did not see either an entry wound or trajectory that was consistent with the accused’s account. He added:
	


“… And I find it difficult to see how that has gone in that scenario in a very neat, upwards 45 degree angle. That to me is the crux of what is going on here.” (T 118:35-41.)


	
	In relation to photographs 2, 3 and 4, he was asked by the Crown to note from the photographs that the knife was shown as sticking “… a bit above the log”: T 119:1-5. In this respect Dr Beer spoke of the log in that sense as operating as a “barrier”. He was asked, that if the accused’s account of the deceased falling on the log was correct, whether it would only be the tip of the knife showing above the log that would penetrate or go into the deceased after impact with the log. Dr Beer considered that that would be the case and that the log would roll forward which he stated would have the effect of stopping any further insertion of the knife into the deceased: T 119:1-15. The actual depth of the wound as revealed on the autopsy examination he agreed was far greater than the extent of the tip projecting above the log: T 119:14-16. The depth of the wound was identified as another fact that was inconsistent with the version related by the accused.
	
	
	In commenting upon the proffered explanation from the accused as to how the incident occurred, with the deceased stumbling and falling onto the knife, Dr Beer wrote in his report at p 4:
	


“… While the dynamics of this occurring cannot be totally excluded this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the autopsy findings, and is not particularly plausible.”


	
	Dr Beer said that the depth of the wound was 37mm, about one-third, halfway up the knife and continued up to the base of the knife. He said that it looked very much like a stab wound to him: T 113:25-35. He based that observation upon the fact that he had seen a number of stab wounds in the course of his work as a forensic pathologist.
	
	
	Dr Beer addressed certain theoretical possibilities. He said that he could not utterly exclude suicide by thrusting a knife and that that was the only way he could see how “you can do that”: T 114:1-5. However, he said that he did not see that as being particularly realistic. If one was looking at a situation of someone else having stabbed the deceased, then based on his findings it would have been by someone probably from below thrusting the knife upwards: T 114:1-10.
	
	
	The scenario was put to Dr Beer of the accused sitting preparing dinner, and cutting vegetables using a knife, an argument then developed between himself and the accused and the deceased and then the accused lashed out at the deceased with the knife, hitting him not in the chest or neck, but somewhere in the leg. Dr Beer said that that account is consistent with the wound that he saw: T 114:10-15.
	
	
	In that latter scenario he assumed that the deceased would have been standing and the accused either sitting or being below him. He indicated an upward thrust towards the deceased: T 114:25-30.
	


Toxicology Results


	
	The toxicology results showed a raised blood alcohol level of the deceased of 0.122g/100mL and increased level of Tramadol, a narcotic agent. Dr Beer stated that the blood alcohol level, given the deceased’s history may well have been fairly normal for him. As to the effects of alcohol and other substances that had been consumed by the deceased, Dr Beer considered that they or their effects may relevantly be assessed on the basis of contemporaneous observations by independent witnesses: T 103:5-10. There was, I note, evidence from Mr Jones that he saw the deceased walking on a number of occasions on 15 January 2012 and he noted nothing unusual in the way the deceased walked.
	
	
	Dr Beer noted that the toxicology results revealed an increased level of Tramadol (a narcotic agent) which could be in the reported low toxic or low lethal range levels, but in a user such as the deceased was consistent with chronic habituation to the drug. There was also therapeutic levels of paracetamol, and evidence of cannabis use.
	
	
	Tramadol he said was a synthetic opioid agent and used for pain relief. He said there was a very wide overlap between what might be considered to be just above therapeutic to being toxic to lethal.
	
	
	In relation to the combination of Tramadol and alcohol, Dr Beer stated that he could not give an accurate estimate of how it might have affected the deceased, knowing that he used alcohol and Tramadol on a regular basis. He agreed that the observations of independent witnesses as to the deceased’s condition would be, as I have already indicated, more relevant. I will in due course refer to the evidence of Mr Jones who saw the deceased walking without apparent difficulty on 15 January 2012.
	


(I) The Evidence of Dr Andrew McIntosh


	
	Dr Andrew McIntosh, Biomechanics and Ergonomics consultant, produced a Biomechanical Report regarding the death of Shayne MacDonald dated 17 January 2013, a copy of which was included in Exhibit A, Tab A. The Report describes a biomechanical analysis of the circumstances in which it was alleged that the deceased suffered a fatal stab wound to his left upper thigh. He also provided a Supplementary Biomechanical Report dated 2 August 2013.
	
	
	Dr McIntosh holds a number of degrees including Master of Biomechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales (1991) and Bachelor of Applied Science in Physiology at the University of Sydney (1984). He has been consulting in the area of biomechanics since the late 1990s. His curriculum vitae set out details as to his background experience and consulting services in relation to biomechanical matters. In relation to the area of human biomechanics, Dr McIntosh studied anatomy and physiology and biomechanics as an undergraduate and later biomechanical engineering and specialised courses of biomechanics and ergonomics.
	
	
	Objection was taken to Dr McIntosh’s evidence on the basis that he was not a forensic pathologist and for other reasons set out concerning a number of matters raised in the Outline of Defence Submissions on Admissibility of Opinion of Dr Andrew McIntosh. These included a question as to whether or not Dr McIntosh had expertise in the specific domain that he was engaged for, namely, expertise in the causation of knife wounds. Whilst it was acknowledged that Dr McIntosh had undoubted expertise in other areas of biomechanical analysis, it was argued that there were many variables in terms of measurements, unknown orientation of the log and knife and inaccuracy in measuring the wound angle: Submissions at [4]. It was submitted that there would be a relatively high degree of impression in the calculations used by Dr McIntosh, and an unacceptable degree of speculation.
	
	
	Submissions were made for exclusion under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  A number of alleged “problematic issues” were set out in the written submissions at [7]. It was additionally submitted that the probative value was outweighed by the unfair prejudice that would arise from Dr McIntosh’s opinion evidence.
	
	
	Dr McIntosh’s evidence established that he had had professional experience in the biomechanics of bodily movement. Dr McIntosh possesses expertise and experience in the field of biomechanics generally and in particular in relation to injury causation. His professional experience has involved him attending autopsies for the purpose of investigating accidental and intentional violence.
	
	
	I have concluded that Dr McIntosh by virtue of his training, qualifications and experience is well-qualified to give expert evidence in terms of s 79 of the Evidence Act upon the matters the subject of his reports and oral evidence. His reports and evidence are admissible expert evidence having regard to Dr McIntosh’s academic, post-graduate training and practical experience in analysing biomechanical issues. I do not consider that any prejudice arises from the admission of the evidence which is probative of matters relevant to facts in issue.
	
	
	Dr McIntosh identified the materials available to him, including a copy of the ERISP with the accused. His Report contains relevant photographs of the incident scene and the log (Figure 3). He noted the dimensions of the log were: circumference of the log at one end to be under 725mm, in the middle 725mm and at the other end 715mm. Figures 5 and 6 of his Report depicted the wound location and the wound angle in sagittal plane (not to scale) respectively. The latter diagram, Figure 6, depicts by a black arrow the wound angle showing the knife having gone into the thigh and upwards at a 45 degree angle.
	
	
	Dr McIntosh noted that the knife was 155mm from tip to hilt and its maximum width was 37mm.
	
	
	Dr McIntosh observed that in relation to the orientation of the knife against the log, the maximum height the blade could reach above the uppermost surface of the log was between 30mm to 55mm, depending upon the varying radius along the length of the log.
	
	
	Figures 9-13 inclusive of Dr McIntosh’s first Report, depict the knife at various angles resting against the log.
	


Scenarios Examined


	
	Dr McIntosh examined three basic scenarios in his Report. The first scenario related to the knife being positioned on the side of the log furthest away from the deceased and closest to the accused (that is, the far side). This scenario accorded with the facts established in evidence. The second scenario dealt with the knife positioned closest to the deceased and on the side of the log furthest away from the accused. The third scenario is not of relevance and need not be discussed.
	
	
	In dealing with the first scenario, which is the relevant scenario for the purpose of the present proceedings, Dr McIntosh’s analysis included the following observations that:
	



	
	The log presents a critical barrier to the knife entering the thigh at 45 degrees upwards. This was because the thigh (with or without compression of the soft tissue) must sit at a tangent to the edge of the log.
	
	
	Even in the most likely scenario with the blade vertical, due to the height of the blade above the top surface of the log, it was not possible for the thigh to be oriented in a position that could give rise to a 45 degree wound angle: Report at [25].
	



	
	Figure 14 in Dr McIntosh’s Report is a schematic diagram of scenario 1 depicting the knife in a situation where the deceased had stumbled and fallen towards the knife.
	
	
	In oral evidence Dr McIntosh stated that, in relation to scenario 1 as depicted in Figure 14, his basic finding was that in that scenario which is assumed to have occurred it would be very unlikely that the knife wound could have assumed the angle as it was observed by the forensic pathologist (Dr Beer). Nor, on that basis, would the knife have been at the depth that it in fact reached he said: T 142:5-12.
	
	
	He additionally observed that the log would have presented itself as a critical barrier to the knife entering the thigh at a 45 degree angle upwards. In oral evidence he explained that the log represented a barrier to the thigh engaging with the blade of the knife. He explained that because the surface of the thigh had to be at a tangent, the log operated as a barrier: T 142:15-21.
	
	
	If someone fell and the blade was sitting in a vertical position (with the blade having a potential height above the log), the knife would engage the person’s thigh. However, because the knife was sitting up vertically a 45 degree upward knife entry wound would be unlikely: T 142:25-31.
	
	
	If the knife were not lying vertically, but just lying against the log pointing towards the front of the tent, then, Dr McIntosh observed, the likelihood of a 45 degree angle would be even less likely than the scenario with the blade being in the vertical position. He stated;
	


“… the knife would be more likely to cause a wound which is pointing down towards the knee, not up towards the pelvis.” (T 142:35-40)


	
	This latter orientation of the knife was depicted within Figure 13 to Dr McIntosh’s Report.
	
	
	In the event of the deceased stumbling and landing on the log, Dr McIntosh stated that in those circumstances it was possible that the log would move in which event the knife would be pushed over by the log as the log moved forward towards the tent: T 143:1-10.
	
	
	In that scenario, with the thigh falling onto the log with only a bit of the knife poking up above it, Dr McIntosh stated that the wound would not have been as deep as 95mm:
	


“… Because there’s a rigid barrier created by the log and there is only the tip of the blade above it which is not 95mm.” (T 143:15-20)


	
	In summary, in that latter scenario the angle of the wound and the depth of the wound would not be consistent with the wound actually inflicted.
	


Consequences if the Deceased Fell on the Log


	
	Dr McIntosh agreed that if there was movement of the knife caused, for example, by somebody falling on the log causing the knife to move around, the wound would be potentially jagged or the opening aperture would be widened because of the knife moving or the thigh moving relative to the knife: T 144:25-36. He observed that if the width of the wound was 37mm, and that that was the same as the width of the knife at its greatest width, that fact would not be supportive of the knife moving around: T 144:39-41.
	
	
	It was put to him by the Crown Prosecutor:
	


“Q.   … but if there was one stab wound which created a wound the exact same width as the knife without there being frayed edges or further movement around – perhaps widening the width of the knife wound, would that be consistent with the knife being held firmly at the hilt?

A.   It would be consistent with a – with the knife being held firmly or the forces being applied in the single trajectory and then removed.” (T 145:1-5)


	
	In relation to the possibility of the wound being caused by the deceased falling:
	



	
	In that scenario Dr McIntosh considered that it was more likely than not that the hilt of the knife would be moving.
	
	
	The tip of the knife being pushed down with the movement of the log there would be even less of the knife blade above the log to penetrate the thigh, that is, it is going to be pushed away and lose height above the log: T 145:5-20.
	


Dr McIntosh’s Conclusions


	
	Dr McIntosh set out his opinion on a number of aspects at [31]-[36] of his Report. These include:
	



	
	His analyses showed that it was very unlikely that there were orientations of the thigh, log and knife that could give rise to the knife being orientated relative to the thigh in the same angle as the actual knife wound found on autopsy.
	
	
	Though he referred to “limited orientations” of the thigh, log and knife in combination with the requirement for thigh compression that could give rise to the knife being orientated relative to the thigh in approximately the same angle as the knife wound. The pattern of injuries suffered by the deceased were not consistent with the mechanism of injury that gives rise to the wound angle in that limited set of circumstances: at [31] of his report.
	
	
	His analyses established that the possibility of the wound being caused by the knife being placed against the side of the log closest to the accused is remote, that is, highly unlikely but not impossible.
	
	
	The force associated with forward momentum in the event of a fall would tend to move the knife away from the log and also change the orientation of the wound.
	
	
	In the scenario where the knife is knocked over and fallen on, the knife and the person are moving together or potentially the person is moving away from the knife. Therefore it is unlikely that the knife would penetrate into the thigh under those circumstances: at [35].
	



	
	Dr McIntosh set out the limitations that operate in deriving his analyses in the following terms:
	


“There are a number of limitations. The orientation of the log and the orientation of the knife against the log are unknown, as is the alleged nature of the fall. The slipperiness of the ground and the ability of the knife to be wedged into the ground are also not quantifiable. The accuracy of the measurement of the thigh wound is also not known. Therefore, assumptions have been made to develop scenarios for which there are informative solutions. The author has not seen autopsy photographs or discussed this case with the pathologist.” (Report at [37])


	
	Dr McIntosh also expressed the following opinions:
	



	
	The feasibility of the wound being inflicted in the way described by the accused was low and unlikely, although, as he said, not impossible.
	
	
	The feasibility that the wound was inflicted by any other type of fall onto the log was low. There were possible orientations of the knife combined with a specific fall that might give rise to the wound (eg, with the knife placed on the side nearest to the deceased).
	
	
	Apart from a very limited set of circumstances under which the knife could have entered the thigh at the observed angle, injuries that might be anticipated had those circumstances come into play, were not observed in this case, that is, no thigh bruising and abrasions.
	



	
	In relation to the limitations stated at [37] of his Report, Dr McIntosh explained that there were “constraints” in terms of a scenario in which the deceased was walking and fell on the log resulting in a knife penetrating the thigh. The constraints include: (a) movement of the knife; (b) movement of the person; and (c) deflection. Dr McIntosh said not all of such variables could be inferred in any particular way: T 156:1-15.
	
	
	In cross-examination it was put to Dr McIntosh that as a result of applying his scientific method to the question before him, he did not exclude the possibility of a fall onto the knife as described by the accused. He responded:
	


“A.   No, I believe I have not excluded that as a possibility.” (T 158:5-10)


	
	In re-examination, he was asked:
	


“Q.   What’s the likelihood of this occurring from your investigations as the accused indicated?

A.   It’s very unlikely.” (T 158:25-30)

(J) Submissions for the Accused


	
	It was submitted that the Crown had not proven murder beyond reasonable doubt. In the written and oral submissions it was contended that the accused’s account was consistent with an accidental fall. A number of matters in that respect were relied upon including the following:
	



	
	The accused’s evidence that she heard a knife snap against the log and the deceased then tripped over the log.
	
	
	The accused behaved in a manner inconsistent with somebody who had deliberately inflicted a stab wound. In that respect, reference was made to the accused’s account of having obtained a towel and wrapping it around the accused’s leg and applying pressure, calling for help via the railway station’s emergency phone, assisting in resuscitation efforts and the distress that she manifested including distress during the course of the ERISP, crying for a substantial portion of its duration.
	
	
	The evidence of the Help Point recordings in which the accused sought medical assistance and in which she provided an account that was consistent with an accidental fall.
	
	
	There was evidence from other witnesses which supported the accused’s account of accident, or was evidence inconsistent with deliberate stabbing. This included:
	



	
	The accused’s cooperation with Senior Constable Loasby in performing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation on the deceased.
	
	
	Her assisting Mr MacRitchie in relation to his efforts to perform CPR.
	
	
	The evidence of witnesses including a Ms Banner who saw the accused giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
	



	
	In addition it was submitted that in relation to the account of the deceased falling on the knife, there was evidence that that was consistent with the accused’s account. This included:
	



	
	The evidence of Senior Constable Loasby who was given an account by the accused of the deceased having tripped and fallen on a knife which was lying against the log.
	
	
	The evidence of Senior Constable Dawkings to whom the accused provided an account of the deceased falling down on the knife.
	
	
	The evidence of Senior Constable Formston receiving a similar account.
	
	
	Her account to Mr MacRitchie and to Ms Hendrickson.
	



	
	Reliance was also placed upon observations of others who saw the accused in the distressed and/or distraught state. This included evidence referring to the accused sobbing and crying, being agitated and distressed.
	
	
	In relation to expert opinion evidence, it was submitted that although all three expert witnesses gave the opinion that the most probable explanation was a deliberate stabbing, an accidental fall could not be excluded as a reasonable possibility.
	
	
	Reliance was also placed upon the evidence of Dr Duflou including his evidence of having seen a bruise on the deceased’s knee which was said to be consistent with a fall. As I have noted elsewhere, there is an issue as to whether this was a new or old bruise.
	
	
	Submissions were made in relation to relationship evidence and the directions that are required, and the issue of lies and the directions required, including in particular, directions of the Edwards type (R v Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 198, 210).
	
	
	In the submissions for the accused a Not Guilty verdict was sought, and it was submitted that the accused should be acquitted. It was submitted that the Crown had not proven murder or the alternative charge of manslaughter beyond reasonable doubt.
	


CONSIDERATION


	
	I commence by observing that the accused is to be taken as a person of limited good character, that is to say that she has no criminal convictions for offences of violence. Accordingly, in that respect I direct myself as follows:
	



	
	Her good character is to be taken into account in her favour on the question of whether the Crown has proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The fact that she has no criminal convictions for offences of violence is relevant to the likelihood of her having committed the offence of murder.
	
	
	I am permitted to take account of her limited good character by reasoning that such a person is unlikely to have committed the offence charged.
	



	
	I also note the statement of Mr Peter Moore dated 6 March 2012 (Exhibit A, Tab 8) in which he stated that over the time he had been associated with the accused (a period of approximately 16 or 17 years, part of which time they had lived in a domestic relationship) he had not seen her exhibit any violent conduct.
	
	
	The Crown case relied upon circumstantial evidence at the centre of which were the findings made on autopsy concerning the injury received and the cause of death. The expert evidence, as I have indicated, consisted of the reports of Dr Beer, on the basis of his autopsy findings, and that of Dr McIntosh in relation to the biomechanical aspects, in which there were identified matters that were consistent with and supportive of the means by which the wound was inflicted, namely a deliberate stabbing action. The evidence of Dr Duflou called in the defence case, did not dispute the essential findings of Dr Beer. Nor did Dr Duflou contest the conclusions reached by Dr Beer based on those findings. Indeed, Dr Duflou’s conclusion that it was likely that the deceased died from a deliberate stab wound was wholly consistent with the conclusions of Drs Beer and McIntosh. The issue raised by Dr Duflou was whether, on the facts established in evidence, there was open a reasonable possibility consistent with the accused’s account of the incident.
	
	
	A judge sitting alone, or a jury, cannot be satisfied to the requisite standard of proof – proof beyond reasonable doubt – on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances. I refer in that respect to the High Court’s decision in R v Hillier (2007) 225 CLR 618 at [46] per Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ. As there also observed, it is of critical importance to recognise that in considering a circumstantial case, all the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence. Reference in that respect was made to the well-known dicta in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 per Dawson J at 579.
	
	
	In Hellier it was also observed that often enough in a circumstantial case there will be evidence of matters looked at in isolation from other evidence that would yield an inference compatible with the innocence of the accused. But neither at trial, nor on appeal, is a circumstantial evidence case to be considered piecemeal: at [48].
	
	
	In this case there is evidence of the accused’s version to police in the ERISP conducted on 16 January 2012, a copy of which, as I have stated, is behind Tab A of Exhibit A, in particular, the Questions and Answers 40-46 and 249-288.
	
	
	The statements made by the accused, including the Help Point calls and her statement in the call made at 17:27:07, namely, that “he fell on a knife” and her statements to others at the incident scene, and in the ERISP, require close consideration along with the other evidence. In that respect, evidence bearing upon the accused’s credibility is critical. This is particularly so in circumstances where she gave her account or version of the incident on the day that it occurred. Additionally, the evidence as to the findings on autopsy are to be assessed for their significance in terms as to whether it supports or negates a reasonable or rational alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence.
	
	
	I will return to these aspects shortly.
	


(J) Relationship Evidence


	
	Relationship evidence in its traditional sense is evidence that places the acts of the accused in context: Qualtieri v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 95 at [144].
	
	
	In that case it was observed that relationship evidence which is relevant is admissible under the Evidence Act 1995. That evidence is not subject to the operation of the tendency rule because the evidence is not being admitted to prove a propensity or tendency on the part of the accused to do the act charged: Qualtieri at [115]. Reference was made to the decision in R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101.
	
	
	Accordingly the evidence may be admitted where the relationship between the accused and some other person is a relevant matter. It is admitted not to prove that the accused had any particular propensity or disposition towards the deceased but to put the particular allegations in the context of the whole of the relationship: Qualtieri at [116].
	
	
	Accordingly, it is necessary to guard against the use of context of relationship evidence as tendency reasoning: R v Rowe [2002] NSWCCA 455 at [270]-[282].
	
	
	I accept, as submitted on behalf of the accused, that the necessary self-direction I am required to give and which I do adhere to, is in the following terms:
	


“a.   The purpose of the tender of the evidence (ie its purpose is to establish a context for the offence);

b.   Its purpose is not to use the evidence of as establishing a propensity on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged;

c.   It is not to substitute the relationship evidence for the evidence led in support of the charges in the indictment; and

d.   It is not to reason that, because the accused committed other acts of misconduct, he or she is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed the offence(s) charged.”


	
	The evidence of witnesses called in the Crown case establishes that, prior to 15 January 2012, the deceased and the accused had had a volatile relationship during which at times the accused swore and verbally abused the deceased and that this was often associated, it would seem, with the accused’s intoxicated condition. The evidence indicates that they not infrequently engaged in heated exchanges, with the accused being the more aggressive of the two. This, on the occasions to which Ms McDonald and Ms Mulheran referred, involved some physical acts of violence towards the deceased by the accused.
	
	
	That said, the evidence however does not suggest that these acts of physical violence by the accused were premeditated. On the evidence, I am of the opinion that they are indicative of a spontaneous loss of self-control, probably due at least in part, on some occasions, to the accused’s excessive use of alcohol.
	


Lies


	
	The Crown submitted that the accused told many lies in her ERISP and that these lies show a consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	The Crown, in particular, contended that the accused lied about the following matters:
	



	
	Whether or not she had previously assaulted the deceased.
	
	
	Whether she had had significant or major arguments with the deceased.
	
	
	Whether she had abused the accused yelling at him and swearing at him.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that many of the lies said to have been told by the accused adversely affects her credibility and shows her cunning nature. It was submitted that the evidence of independent witnesses showed that the accused was violent towards the deceased and that given what was referred to as the “plethora of lies, it would be difficult for a jury to accept anything she said”: Crown Written Submissions at [39]. It was submitted that it would be difficult to accept her version about the injury to the deceased occurring in a fall onto the knife.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted at [40] that in her answers in the ERISP the accused lied constantly, trying to paint a picture of a benign relationship between herself and the deceased, which did not involve assaults by her on him and did not involve her yelling at him or involve any major arguments out of the ordinary: Crown Written Submissions at [40].
	
	
	Further, the Crown contended that she denied swearing at him on 15 January 2012.
	
	
	In relation to the accused’s answers in the ERISP on the subject of her relationship, the following is noted:
	



	
	Question 122 – when asked whether she and the deceased got along, she said “Yeah, good”.
	
	
	In answer to Question 123 she said that they had “little arguments here and there, but nothing spectacular or nothing horrible … like it was all good. Yeah.”
	
	
	When asked at Question 125 how often they would argue, the accused said “Oh, not that often. Not that often. Only about once a week or something like that. Like the ex-boyfriend rings up and harasses me on the phone and stuff like that and Shayne -- gets the shits with it and yeah, he used to get the shits about, yeah.”
	
	
	In Question 133 she was asked whether he, referring to the deceased, had ever assaulted her, to which she replied in the negative. When at Question 134 she was asked whether she had ever assaulted the deceased, she said “No”.
	
	
	At Question 135 she was asked whether she and the deceased yell at each other. The accused replied “Yeah. Of course we yell at one another. Yeah.” When asked at Question 136 how often, she said “Not a regular thing”. In answer to Question 137 she repeated it wasn’t a regular thing, maybe every couple of days they would have a couple of words with one another, but nothing spectacular, nothing out of the ordinary. “It’s just verbal shit.”
	
	
	At Question 139 when asked whether she had any major arguments since she had been out at Wondabyne, she answered: “No.” At Question 140 when asked “Like in the last week or so?” she replied “No. No. None. None at all.”
	
	
	When asked at Question 141 whether they had any arguments with each other on 15 January 2012, the accused responded “No. Had a few words this morning, because his mattress was going on a bit flat. He woke up with the shits. I said ‘Oh, get over it’. I said ‘grow up’.”
	
	
	At Question 431 the accused was asked whether she and the deceased were yelling at each other “today”, the accused responded “No, no.” At Question 432 she was asked whether they were raising their voices at each other, to which the accused again replied “No, no”. When asked about swearing at each other, the accused again replied “No.”
	
	
	At Question 434, she said sometimes when talking to somebody she would swear sometimes. At Question 436 when asked whether she would call the deceased names, she said “Sometimes I call him a mutt”.
	
	
	At Question 439 she was asked whether she was calling him those names “today”. She responded “No”. At Question 440 she was asked whether she remembered swearing at him at all “today”. She again replied “No” and said that he did not swear at her. At Question 442 she was asked “So there was no other argument or anything at all ---”. She answered “No”. Question 442 --- except apart from the mattress earlier this morning? Answer – “yeah, it wasn’t even an argument”.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the lies of the accused show a consciousness of guilt, that they were deliberate, related to events of the day in question and previous days and the verbal abuse, swearing etc were corroborated by several independent witnesses: Crown Written Submissions at [43]. The Crown submitted the lies relate to a material issue, namely, the violence and aggressive and abusive behaviour of the accused towards the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the lies were deliberate because the accused knew the truth of the matter would implicate her in the offence: Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193.
	
	
	The Crown also submitted that the lies were verified by independent evidence and that accordingly there is considerable certainty about them: Crown Written Submissions at [45].
	
	
	On behalf of the accused it was submitted that as the ERISP contains statements the Crown now seeks to rely upon adverse to the accused, they are admissions and s 85 of the Evidence Act 1995 applies: R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442, 458.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the ERISP was conducted by an investigating official (Sergeant Leaity) performing functions related to the investigation into the death of the deceased: s 85(1) Evidence Act.
	
	
	It was submitted that the statements were not admissible in evidence as admissions, unless the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected: s 85(2) Evidence Act. This is to be proved on the balance of probabilities once an arguable point is identified by the accused. Only if the court is so satisfied can the evidence be admitted: R v Esposito at 459.
	
	
	The following factors were said to affect the truth or untruth of the admissions:
	


a.   The accused was an alcoholic and certainly affected by alcohol, suffering from withdrawal symptoms, or hung over at the time of the interview,

b.   The ERISP commenced within seven hours of the accused witnessing the death of the deceased. The distress witnessed at the Wondabyne campsite continues to be constantly evidence in the ERISP.

c.   The accused at A370 of the ERISP expresses a desire to go home, yet the police continue with the interview.”


	
	It was submitted that the combination of these factors would cause the Court to find that it was not unlikely that the truth of the admissions were adversely affected.
	
	
	If admitted the question as to whether the statements were lies must be considered. In that respect, to be a lie the person must say something the person knows at the time of making the statement is untrue.
	
	
	I will deal with the issue raised under s 85 of the Evidence Act. In R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442 the appellant gave answers when interviewed by police in which, amongst other things, she denied being at or having knowledge or involvement in the events in which the deceased in that case was stabbed. In that case at p 458, Wood CJ at CL held that the provisions of s 85 of the Evidence Act which applies in a criminal proceeding and to evidence by way of an admission by an accused is not confined to inculpatory statements. Statements that were adverse so far as they were relied upon as constituting an implied admission of guilt may fall within the expression “an admission” even though they were on their face exculpatory (pp 458-9).
	
	
	The provisions of s 85 are concerned with circumstances in which an admission is made by a defendant or accused person, specifically with those in existence during official questioning. The evidence of an admission may be admitted if the circumstances referred to in s 85(2) make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. It is for the defence to identify an arguable point in that regard whereupon its admissibility will fall to be determined in accordance with the standard of proof specified in s 142 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	I proceed upon the basis that the statements made by the accused, on which the Crown relies as lies, are admissions and are to be considered in accordance with the provisions of s 85 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	It was submitted that a combination of the “physical and environmental factors” to which I have referred in [180] combined would cause this Court to find that it was not unlikely that the truth of the admissions were adversely affected.
	
	
	Submissions were then made that, in the event that the statements were admitted, then the applicable principles must be applied. I will refer to those principles shortly.
	
	
	Accepting as I do that, at the time of the ERISP the accused was still experiencing a level of distress and that at a later point in the ERISP she expressed a desire to go home, I do not consider that the answers by the accused in question occurred in circumstances such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected within the meaning of s 85(2).
	
	
	I take into account that the ERISP commenced at 12:36am on 16 January 2012 and terminated at 1:58am. She was asked a large number of questions with the interview effectively finishing at Question 558.
	
	
	A reading of the ERISP does not reveal that the accused had any particular difficulties in understanding or responding to questions asked of her. In general terms the answers appear to be responsive to the point or points of the questions asked. The answers which the Crown contends were lies related to questions as to the disharmony in the relationship and issues as to verbal and physical abuse in the course of the relationship, including in particular the accused’s conduct towards the deceased on 15 January 2012 in terms of arguing with him, and swearing at him. There was a series of questions which raised with the accused detailed inquiry on such matters. It is evident from the ERISP that the accused understood the topics or subject matters to which the questions were put to her on a repeated basis and she persisted in her denials of having engaged in either abusive conduct towards the decease (both physical and verbal abuse) raised by the questions.
	
	
	Whist it is also accepted that the evidence indicates that the accused was an alcoholic and that having consumed alcohol on 15 January 2012, she would to some extent be affected by having done so there is no suggestion in the course of the ERISP that the accused was manifesting any signs or difficulties associated with her ability to participate in the ERISP and to understand and to respond to questions. I do not consider that the fact that the accused was an alcoholic and had consumed alcohol constituted circumstances which impacted adversely upon the accused. In summary, I am of the opinion that the circumstances in which the admissions made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. In other words, I do not consider that the onus has been discharged to show that those circumstances impaired or affected the accused in an adverse way.
	
	
	I have concluded that the evidence of the answers given by the accused in the course of the ERISP upon which the Crown relies as lies and evidence of consciousness of guilt, is admissible as lies. In those circumstances it is necessary that I direct myself in relation to the principles that apply to evidence of lies as consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	In that respect, I note the following:
	



	
	A lie is to say something untrue, knowing at the time of making the statement that it is untrue. This, of course, distinguishes the situation in which a person is simply mistaken or perhaps confused.
	
	
	In determining whether the answers given in the ERISP by the accused upon which the Crown relies constituted lies, reference is to be made to the evidence of witnesses who gave evidence as to the accused’s conduct, in particular, prior physical abuse of the deceased by the accused (Ms MacDonald and Ms Mulheran) and to evidence of the witnesses called in the Crown case who gave evidence of hearing the accused shout abuse and swear at the deceased during the course of 15 January 2012. On the basis of this evidence I am satisfied that the answers given by the accused to the questions contained in the ERISP to which I have referred deliberate falsehoods or constituted lies.
	
	
	It is necessary that I direct myself to the care with which the task of deciding what significance, if any, the lies have in the proceedings.
	
	
	Before I may use the evidence of lies as some evidence of the accused’s guilt there are two further matters to be observed:
	



	
	The first is that I must find that what the accused said and which amounts to a lie or lies relates to an issue that is relevant to the offence that the Crown alleges the accused committed. It must in other words relate to some significant circumstance or event connected with the alleged offence. The Crown says that it is relevant because the answers given were deliberate, that they related to events of that day and the previous days and that they relate to a material issue, namely, the violent, aggressive and abusive behaviour of the accused towards the deceased.
	
	
	I must find that the accused told the lies because she feared that telling the truth might reveal her guilt in respect of the charge she now faces. In other words she feared that telling the truth would implicate her in the commission of the offence for which she now faces because it would indicate that she had been violent and aggressive towards, and abusive to, the deceased.
	



	
	And finally, the lie or lies as I have indicated must be established as such by evidence independent of the admission or any admission made by the accused.
	



	
	As I have earlier indicated, great caution must be exercised before it is determined that lies constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt, bearing in mind that people do not always act rationally and the telling of a lie can be explained in other ways than consciousness of guilt, for example, embarrassment, panic or to escape an unjust accusation. In particular, I also observe the need for caution on the basis discussed in R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697, 701.
	
	
	I further remind myself and take into account that though lies may be taken into account as evidence of consciousness of guilt they cannot prove guilt on their own. They may be considered along with all the other facts that the Crown relies upon and which I find have been established on the evidence in considering whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Although as I have stated the whole of the evidence must be considered, the issues that have been the subject of extensive expert evidence, as well as the accused’s credibility, are central to the determination as to whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence of murder or the alternative offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	Taking into account the matters to which I have referred and the principles to be applied, I have concluded as I have indicated that the accused’s answers in the ERISP relied upon by the Crown were lies and constitute evidence of consciousness of guilt.
	
	
	In so concluding I have given particular attention to what I consider to have been the existence of the necessary link between the accused’s conduct in relation to the answers she gave to questions in the ERISP and the circumstances associated with the death of the deceased.
	


CONCLUSIONS


	
	In determining whether the Crown has discharged the onus of proof the primary question is whether or not the evidence in the Crown case establishes to the requisite standard that the act or omission of the accused caused the death of the victim, in this case the deceased.
	
	
	In the event that the evidence does establish that element of the offence of murder, it will be necessary to determine the offence of murder, that is to say the issue as to whether the accused stabbed the deceased. I proceed to determine the issue as to the state of mind of the accused, namely, whether any act or omission was done by the accused with the intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm to the deceased.
	
	
	As to the medical evidence, there is essentially no dispute, as I have indicated, between Dr Beer and Dr Deflou either as to the findings or the analysis undertaken by Dr Beer. Dr Deflou stated that the autopsy appears to have been professionally and competently performed, and there was a detailed description of the various abnormalities. Dr Deflou stated as to the cause of death “In my opinion, death is the result of a stab wound to the thigh, with associated injury to the femoral artery and vein”: at [13]. Additionally, in relation to the “mechanism of injury” Dr Deflou stated:
	


“I agree with both Dr Beer and Dr McIntosh that most likely the stab wound to the thigh was inflicted in a stabbing motion by another person. However, in my opinion it remains entirely possible for the injury to have been sustained by the deceased falling or stumbling in some way onto the knife while it was resting against the log …”


	
	Dr Deflou then set out the grounds for that opinion in para [14]. In a case such as the present it is not sufficient for Dr Deflou to say there was an alternative and reasonable possibility unless there were facts established in evidence to support that suggested conclusion or hypothesis. I turn to what I refer to firstly as affirmative findings. 
	


(i) Affirmative Findings


	
	The findings made by Dr Beer on his autopsy examination which are supportive of a stabbing action include:
	



	
	The trajectory of the knife wound tracking upwards at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.
	
	
	The neatness of the wound and its width of 38mm (the same as the widest point of the blade of the knife) was consistent with a stabbing action.
	
	
	The nicely “shelved appearance” of the wound going upwards.
	
	
	On the autopsy examination, the wound, its structure, that it looked very much like a stab wound as against accidental wounding according to Dr Beer at T 113:30-31.
	
	
	The wound was consistent with someone located at a lower level (sitting or standing below the deceased), thrusting the knife upwards: Dr Beer at T 114:7-25.
	


(ii) Facts Inconsistent with the Accused’s Version


	
	The facts inconsistent with the accused’s version included:
	



	
	The entry point of the blade of the knife on her version would have been expected to have been horizontal into the thigh or tracking downwards: Dr Beer at T 111; T 118:20-25.
	
	
	If the deceased fell forwards with the knife entering at the horizontal level and then trending upwards Dr Beer stated there would not in that event have been the “nice shelved” appearance to the wound seen on autopsy: T 112. A movement forward and falling on the log as shown in photograph 3, Tab C of Exhibit A, would have destroyed or upset the “nice shelving” seen on autopsy: Dr Beer at T 118:30-34.
	
	
	There is difficulty in explaining how, if the incident involved the deceased tripping and falling onto the knife, the knife wound had then proceeded upwards at an angle of 45 degrees towards the groin as found at the autopsy: Dr Beer at T 112:19-25; T 118:39-41.
	
	
	If there had been forward movement upon falling on the log, the wound would have been wider than that revealed on autopsy (the wound in fact, as I have earlier noted, was the same width as the widest part of the blade of the knife (37-38mm)): Dr Beer at T 100:35-40.
	
	
	On the scenario of the knife positioned against the log, if the deceased fell on the log, upon falling the knife would have then moved with the forward movement, in accordance with the movement of the log. On that scenario, Dr Beer stated, one cannot envisage the knife thrusting upwards at 45 degrees as found on autopsy: Dr Beer at T 113:20-25.
	
	
	On Dr McIntosh’s analysis, with forward movement associated with falling on the log, only a small amount of the tip of the knife would project above the log. It could not have produced a wound of the depth of 95mm: T 143:15-20.
	
	
	On the accused’s version it would be expected that the fall on the log would have caused bruising and/or abrasions. There were no injuries found on autopsy other than the fatal wound.
	


(iii) Findings


	
	I determine that, as to the relationship between the accused and the deceased on 15 January 2012, there is a very large disparity between the accused’s account and that of the witnesses who gave evidence as to what they saw and heard. Though asked a number of question in the ERISP as to whether there was argument, and swearing throughout the day between the accused and the deceased, the accused maintained her denial that that had occurred. The accused’s persistent denials during the ERISP were false and deliberately so. They constituted falsehoods in relation to a significant fact, namely, her attitude and behaviour towards the deceased on the day that he suffered the fatal injury. I have earlier indicated the caution that needs to be taken in treating those answers as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Aside from that, the false answers significantly undermine the accused’s credibility as a witness of truth.
	
	
	On the autopsy examination, the central finding was a clean stab wound tracking in an upwards direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, 38mm in width (being the widest part of the knife blade). In Dr Duflou’s report on the question of a reasonable possibility that the deceased’s injury was sustained by falling onto the knife, there was no evidence of analytical examination made or referred to by Dr Duflou in his report as to how an upwards tracking wound at an angle of 45 degrees could have occurred by the deceased tripping and falling on the knife. Unless the upwards tracking wound as described by Dr Beer could be reconciled with a fall, no basis was established for an alternative reasonable or rational explanation or hypothesis. Dr Duflou did not identify any fact or process that would enable the abovementioned central finding of Dr Beer to be so reconciled. There, in other words, were no objective facts or matters established in evidence that were identified by Dr Duflou which would support any reasonable alternative possibility as he asserted may exist. In so saying I do not overlook answers he gave in oral evidence seeking to explain how it might be that there is an alternate possibility. Those answers as I have stated, however, were given in circumstances where, firstly, he did not identify or explain the process by which he had arrived at his opinion, as given by him in oral evidence, but not in his report, and, secondly, how any alternate possibility suggested by him can be reconciled with the objective facts found on autopsy and in accordance with the findings I have made.
	
	
	The particular matters referred to by Dr Duflou, in particular at [34] of his report, do not constitute an analytical examination of the facts proved in evidence. In particular, those matters to which he referred in para [14] of his report do not address the findings at autopsy (including the finding in (2) above) or explain how the matters he addressed in para 14(a) to (j) of his report could leave open a reasonable possibility of wounding by accident.
	
	
	There were no physical signs of injury (abrasions or bruising) arising from the deceased falling on the log as Dr Beer considered would be expected from a fall. In coming to that conclusion I have had due regard to Dr Duflou's evidence as to the possibility that by reason of a fall by the deceased on muddy ground with clothing, that one would in those circumstances not expect to see such signs of injury. His evidence however did not address the point raised by Dr Beer, namely, that if the deceased fell on the log, then in those circumstances one would expect to find physical signs of injury.
	



	
	In relation to events in the course of the relationship between the accused and the deceased I conclude as follows:
	



	
	The relationship between the accused and the deceased had been over a period of some months a volatile one in which the accused had been verbally aggressive towards the deceased.
	
	
	Throughout the relationship both the accused and the deceased were alcoholics. Their excessive drinking correlates with and at least in part explains a pattern made up of sudden eruptions occurring in their relationship involving abuse followed shortly thereafter by a cessation of hostilities and apparent harmony.
	
	
	The prior incidents of physical violence by the accused towards the deceased as described in the evidence of Ms McDonald and Ms Mulheran, occurred in circumstances of spontaneous outbursts of anger and/or frustration or sudden loss of control in the accused. They were not in any way premeditated or planned acts of violence.
	
	
	The volatile nature of the relationship as I have described it manifested itself on 15 January 2012.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any motive in the accused to inflict death or grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.
	
	
	And finally, having considered the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused inflicted the fatal stab wound to the deceased.
	



	
	The Crown case was premised upon a particular set of facts, namely, that prior to the incident the accused was in the seated position using a knife to cut vegetables for an evening meal. (I note the accused’s answers in the ERISP that she was sitting near the scene of the incident at the time it happened: ERISP Q/A 39, 264 and 275.) The accused entered the tent, and on the Crown case an argument ensued and the accused lashed out in an upwards movement from her seated position. This set of facts is far from the not-uncommon case wherein a person armed with a knife, whilst standing and engaging in a confrontation with another, uses a knife as a weapon with forethought and a specific purpose to kill or wound.
	
	
	On the Crown case the accused’s reaction occurred in the course of using the knife initially for an ordinary domestic purpose, namely, the preparation of food. The accused’s reaction at that time in moving the knife in an upwards motion above her in the direction of the deceased, though unlawful and dangerous, exhibited features characteristic of a spontaneous reactive action, though one which carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury, but devoid of any actual intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. In other words, for reasons I have given, in my opinion, this is not a case where intent to cause grievous bodily harm can be said to be self-evident in the stabbing. On a consideration of the whole of the evidence I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of stabbing the deceased the accused had an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him.
	
	
	In those circumstances it is necessary to consider the alternative offence of manslaughter. It is necessary that I direct myself in relation to the principles that apply to such an offence.
	
	
	Manslaughter is committed where the accused causes the death of a person by an act which is both unlawful and dangerous. It is not necessary that the accused was aware that the act was dangerous, provided that a reasonable person would have appreciated that the act was one which, in the circumstances, exposed others to the risk of serious injury: R v Wilson (1992) 174 CLR 313.
	
	
	An unlawful and dangerous act, carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury, may therefore, constitute the offence of manslaughter.
	
	
	The Court must be satisfied that the act causing death was not an accident. The finding I have made, namely that the accused stabbed the deceased in the left thigh, does provide a basis for the conviction for manslaughter.
	
	
	The use of a knife to attack a person, as I have indicated, may in many cases, of course, carry with it an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. However, of course, not all cases involving a knife will necessarily involve an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The present case is not one where the evidence establishes that the accused, for example, chased or confronted the deceased with such an intent. On the Crown case the accused's reaction occurred in a situation where the accused was using the knife initially for an ordinary domestic purpose. In those circumstances, it is a very different situation to those cases where, as an example, the accused has chased or confronted the deceased with criminal intent.
	
	
	In relation to the alternative offence of manslaughter, the Crown in the present case submitted that the accused stabbed the deceased and that the act was unlawful and dangerous and as such manslaughter has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I accept that submission.
	
	
	As the Crown observed in its submissions, self-induced intoxication may not be taken into account in determining if the person had the requisite mens rea for manslaughter: s 428E(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. In my assessment, this is a case involving self-induced intoxication and is not to be taken into account in accordance with those provisions.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the evidence that the Crown has established the offence of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter.
	


Verdicts


	
	I return the following verdicts:
	


Murder: Not guilty.

Unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter: On the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence.

		28 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2701846,R v Mulligan [2016] NSWCCA 47,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with Harrison J.
	
	
	HARRISON J: David Mulligan pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 7 May 2015 to recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm in contravention of s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was committed for sentence to the District Court. His Honour Maiden DCJ sentenced Mr Mulligan on 30 October 2015 by imposing a s 12 order of imprisonment for 15 months, suspended for the same period, to date from 30 October 2015 upon conditions that he be of good behaviour and pay $15,000 to the victim.
	
	
	The offence carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 4 years also applies. The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed by his Honour on several grounds. These are referred to later in these reasons.
	


Background


	
	On Saturday 11 September 2014 the victim was walking his two boxer dogs along a street in suburban Alexandria. The dogs were each on a leash. Mr Mulligan was at this time also walking his small dog on a leash in the same street. Despite everyone’s best endeavours, the three dogs became entangled in a brief scuffle when the victim’s dogs lunged at Mr Mulligan’s dog. The dogs were quickly separated and the boxers were restrained by the victim who took up a stationary position leaning against a parked car. Mr Mulligan and the victim exchanged words and Mr Mulligan picked up his dog and walked off.
	
	
	Mr Mulligan took his dog into a car repair business close to where this incident occurred and left it there. He very soon emerged from these premises and walked back to the victim, who was still by the car with his dogs. Mr Mulligan then proceeded to pace back and forth along the footpath a number of times, coming to within a metre or so of the victim and then walking several metres away from him. A conversation of sorts would appear to have broken out between the two men while this was going on. On the last occasion that Mr Mulligan approached the victim, he punched him three times in the face, causing serious injuries. The victim was unable to offer any effective response in self-defence as he had a dog leash in each hand. Mr Mulligan then retreated from this event, retrieved his own dog and left the area.
	
	
	The victim sustained several fractures to his face. These necessitated the insertion of five metal plates in his face and jaw. The victim continues to suffer from collapsed sinuses and nerve damage to the side of his mouth, resulting in slurred speech. His collapsed sinuses cause lung infections due to fluid entering his lungs.
	


The sentencing proceedings


	
	Mr Mulligan’s plea of guilty to the charge came before his Honour for sentence upon the basis of what were described as agreed facts. It is obvious that these facts were prepared with the benefit of CCTV footage of the incident obtained from a local commercial establishment. So much is clear from the agreed facts which in terms refer to what the CCTV material depicts.
	
	
	Despite the existence of the agreed facts, Mr Wright for the Crown also sought to tender the CCTV material. Counsel for Mr Mulligan initially agreed to that course because he wanted to suggest that part of the written submissions upon which the Crown relied was at odds with what the CCTV footage revealed. It is instructive to record the discussion that ensued when that happened:
	


“WRIGHT: Your Honour, there’s also footage which I propose playing at this point unless your Honour prefers not to. It’s only two minutes.

HIS HONOUR: But the facts are agreed, aren’t they?

WRIGHT: The facts are agreed, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well why would I want to look at the video if the facts are agreed?

WRIGHT: It adds colour and it’s a quick way of assessing what actually occurred. The footage doesn’t in any way contradict--

HIS HONOUR: That’s not my job, with respect, Mr Crown. That’s been agreed.

WRIGHT: I know your Honour, but I do propose playing it unless your Honour prefers not to.

HIS HONOUR: Well I don’t see how it’s relevant frankly if you’ve agreed facts.

CHHABRA: Your Honour, if I could be heard for one moment. Ordinarily I would agree there’s no need to play it. However, the last paragraph on the first page of my friend’s submissions indicates a version of events that I do not agree with, and a viewing of the CCTV footage in my respectful submission would dispel that narrative.

HIS HONOUR: Can you just take me to that?

CHHABRA: Yes, your Honour. The Crown submissions, final paragraph on the first page starting with the words ‘he did not’.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, I see. Mr Crown, did you draft – well they’re obviously your submissions are they?

WRIGHT: Yes, they’re my submissions your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: What do you mean by ‘he turned around and blithely walked right alongside the two larger dogs’?

WRIGHT: It’s clear from the footage that that’s how it appears.

HIS HONOUR: It’s clear from the sentence. What’s that mean?

WRIGHT: Pardon me, your Honour?

HIS HONOUR: What does it mean ‘and blithely walked right alongside the two larger dogs’?

WRIGHT: Well your Honour, the fourth-last paragraph of the agreed facts states that the victim was motionless against – with his dogs seated. He was standing still with the dogs seated. I understand my friend’s version is otherwise and the offender indeed will also say that he was walking.

HIS HONOUR: Let’s just have a look at the facts. The last paragraph on the first page of your submissions, what paragraph of the facts does that relate to?

WRIGHT: The seventh-last paragraph in the agreed facts, your Honour, starting ‘as the offender started to walk past the victim.’ I gather my friend is going to suggest that the victim was walking and the victim’s dogs jumped--

HIS HONOUR: I don’t propose to accept these submissions in this form. You are bound to put in here submissions based on the evidence. In this case it’s the agreed facts. What you have put there is an interpretation that at first glance I can’t see is open to the Crown whose duty it is to put the facts objectively and in a straightforward manner.

WIRGHT: With respect, your Honour, that’s what I’ve done and I’d ask your Honour to view the footage.

HIS HONOUR: I don’t agree. Anyway, I’ll deal with your submissions later.”


	
	In due course, Mr Mulligan gave evidence. It is necessary to refer to some of what he said both as evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination as follows:
	


“Q. It’s the case that you returned to the victim at some point and you threw three strong punches at his head and face. Correct?

A. Yes I did.

Q. Why did you do that?

A. I feared for my dog’s safety. After what happened already, I was just was fearing for my dog’s safety. I just wanted the guy just to leave – just to leave me alone. I feared for my dog and for my own safety as well.

Q. And there was an exchange of words, correct?

A. Yes.   

Q. And he’d asked you to walk away. He said to you walk away, right?

A. Yeah.

Q. What else was said?

A. On the occasion before this happens, I asked him just to control the dogs to which he then turned around and told me to get fucked you Irish cunt before I smash your face in – that was his exact words to me. Those exact words. Those are the honest exact words…(not transcribable)...but that was the exact words that were said.

…

Q. On 27 September last year during this incident with the dogs, do you agree you said to tie your dogs up, to the victim?

A. ...(not transcribable)…

Q. And what was his response?

A. He just kept – he just kept calling me for a fight. Kept calling me. Kept calling me. Saying come on. Come on let’s fight. Let’s fight. Just constantly. He was asking for…(not transcribable)…

Q. Who is he?

A. The guy carrying on.

Q. The victim?

A. The victim yeah.

Q. The victim said let’s fight?

A. Yeah. That’s all he kept saying to me. He kept abusing me because I was Irish. He kept saying he could not understand me.

Q. Didn’t the victim say to you, I’ve got nothing to tie them up to?

A. He said that to me but he was – constantly asking me for an argument – he did say that, he had nothing to tie them to...(not transcribable)…

Q. The victim at no stage said to you, let’s fight, I put to you?

A. He did. He did.

Q. I put to you, the victim at no stage, said to you to get fucked or I’ll smash your head in?

A. He – he said that to me. He called me an Irish cunt, he told me, he said he’s going to smash my face in. That’s why he waited outside the garage.”


	
	Following that and some other evidence, his Honour returned to the issue of the tender of the CCTV material. The Crown maintained that it was in the circumstances now essential that his Honour view that material, having regard to the asserted need to consider it in the light of Mr Mulligan’s evidence of what was said to him, which extended beyond the agreed facts, and to compare it with his response to the victim as depicted. The transcript of what occurred at that point in the proceedings is relevantly in these terms:
	


“WRIGHT: I maintain my submissions. I note your Honour’s opposition to the language in my submissions and I take the point but I do press them and--

HIS HONOUR: I think you should re-do them frankly. I don’t think they properly comply with the duties of a prosecutor.

WRIGHT: Your Honour I disagree and out of procedural fairness I would ask your Honour to view the footage if that is the case.

HIS HONOUR: The footage is not before me, is the point.

WRIGHT: It is in the Crown bundle.

HIS HONOUR: You have--

WRIGHT: It is at tab 9.

HIS HONOUR: No it is not. I don’t want to see it, there are agreed facts.

WRIGHT: I don’t have anything further to add in that case. I have made my submissions--

HIS HONOUR: Why should the Court here be put to the situation of having to view film where I will have to make a finding of facts when there are agreed facts. Either the facts are agreed or they are not agreed and if there is an issue on the facts I should have been told.

WRIGHT: In fairness to all parties I think there was difference on the facts at an earlier stage and it appeared to be resolved. My only purpose in playing the footage was to give colour to what is--

HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown I don’t accept that. You have based your submissions on what I assume was in the -- or what you saw in the video and not from the agreed facts.

WRIGHT: It is from both your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: I beg your pardon?

WRIGHT: It’s from both your Honour. Indeed we have gone past that point now because the offender has given evidence that completely contradicts what were agreed facts, injecting what appear to be oral threats--

HIS HONOUR: I have given you that opportunity, you don’t wish to take it so what are your submissions?”

Grounds of appeal


	
	It seems clear that it was in the context of that procedural background that the Crown’s original grounds of appeal were notified by its notice of appeal filed on 4 November 2015. Those grounds were as follows:
	



	
	The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The judge erred in declining to view CCTV footage of the offence.
	
	
	The judge contravened s 95 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by ordering compensation to be paid as a condition of the bond.
	



	
	The notice of appeal contained the reservation that the Crown would also rely “upon such additional or varied grounds as may be filed later.”
	
	
	On 23 February 2016 the Crown notified that it proposed to rely upon amended grounds of appeal. They are as follows:
	



	
	The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the provisions of s 54B and 54C of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	His Honour erred in reducing the head sentence by a further 16.6% after allowing 25% discount for the plea, by virtue of what his Honour described as “exceptional/special circumstances.”
	
	
	His Honour erred by failing to adequately assess the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	His Honour contravened s 95 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 by ordering the respondent to pay compensation as a condition of the bond attached to the suspended sentence.
	



	
	In his opening submission to this Court the Crown indicated that “a significant aspect of ground one is related to his Honour’s refusal to view the CCTV footage”. The Crown advised that Mr Mulligan had been put on notice that it proposed to play or to tender the CCTV material in this Court for consideration as part of the appeal. The Crown therefore proceeded to take the Court to the tension between Mr Mulligan’s oral evidence before the sentencing judge that raised the spectre of provocation on the one hand and the complete absence of any material in the agreed facts going to that issue on the other hand.
	
	
	Having regard to all of the Crown’s grounds of appeal and to the way in which the argument proceeded in this Court, it is apparent that both parties were content to argue that his Honour’s rejection of the CCTV material remained a live issue for consideration. In this Court the view was taken, in accordance with the approach urged by the Crown, that the CCTV material should be admitted and viewed. It was made clear, however, that Mr Mulligan was at liberty to continue to argue that this Court should exclude the CCTV material from our consideration. The matter thereafter proceeded upon that basis.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is convenient to deal with his Honour’s rejection of the CCTV footage first.
	


CCTV footage rejection


	
	The Crown contended that his Honour’s rejection of the CCTV footage was an error. Mr Mulligan asserted in contrast that it was “entirely orthodox and within principle”.
	
	
	In my opinion his Honour fell into error when he denied the Crown’s attempt to rely upon the CCTV material. There does not appear to have been a formal tender of that material or a formal rejection of it; for example, his Honour did not give any considered written reasons for his decision to refuse the Crown’s attempt to rely upon it. It would, however, be a triumph of form over substance not to conclude that the Crown had asked his Honour to take the material into account in sentencing Mr Mulligan and that his Honour refused to do so.
	
	
	That refusal was in the circumstances a denial of procedural fairness. That is for at least two reasons. First, Mr Mulligan’s oral evidence raised the suggestion that he was provoked by what the victim said to him. That was based upon a version of the conversation between the victim and Mr Mulligan that was not included in the agreed facts. To the extent that the CCTV material potentially informed the suggestion that Mr Mulligan might have been provoked, it was material that the Crown was entitled to call in aid of a submission to rebut it.
	
	
	Secondly, his Honour was generally critical of the Crown’s submissions because they appeared to his Honour to go beyond what was included in the agreed facts. That was so even though the agreed facts specifically mentioned the CCTV material. It was unfair to the Crown for his Honour to have adopted the position that the Crown’s submissions were somehow impermissibly extravagant or, by implication, inaccurate or misleading, if his Honour was not at the same time prepared to permit the Crown to produce the very material that would arguably have justified what the Crown had submitted. It is not without significance in this respect that his Honour specifically referred to the fact that in his view the Crown’s submissions did not comply with the duties of a prosecutor. It was unfair at that point for his Honour to approbate his criticism of the Crown but coincidentally to reprobate the Crown’s practical ability to respond to it.
	
	
	His Honour’s error alone enlivens the requirement that this Court consider whether or not Mr Mulligan should be re-sentenced. Notwithstanding that fact, it remains necessary to consider the balance of the Crown’s grounds of appeal.
	


Reference to special or exceptional circumstances


	
	His Honour’s sentencing remarks contain the following reference:
	


“This is a matter where exceptional circumstances apply. It is conceded that special circumstances are appropriate and the court can show greater leniency and it does so in respect of this particular matter.”


	
	His Honour imposed a non-custodial sentence. It follows that he neither specified a non-parole period nor any balance of term. The usually understood notion of special circumstances in s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, justifying a departure from the statutory ratio of parole and non-parole periods, had no part to play in his Honour’s deliberations.
	
	
	Doing the best I can, it seems to me that his Honour was doing no more and no less than attempting to ameliorate the harshness of the sentence he was required to impose by extending leniency to Mr Mulligan. In the course of explaining that he proposed to do so, his Honour fell into the language of special or exceptional circumstances. That is not of itself an error. By way of contrast, however, the consequent reduction of the sentence by a significant amount in order to extend leniency arguably did erroneously infect the sentencing outcome. In my view his Honour’s obvious sympathies for Mr Mulligan were not in the circumstances of this case “reasonably excited”, even bearing in mind that “prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges”: see R v Osenkowski [1982] 5 A Crim R 394. The Crown’s complaint about the sentence is therefore best addressed in consideration of the Crown’s principal challenge to its adequacy.
	


Sections 54B and 54C Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	Section 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:
	


“54B Consideration of standard non-parole period in sentencing

(2)    The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	Section 54C of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides relevantly as follows:
	


“54C Court to give reasons if non-custodial sentence imposed

(1)    If the court imposes a non-custodial sentence for an offence set out in the Table to this Division, the court must make a record of its reasons for doing so. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each mitigating factor that it took into account.

(2)    The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	Nowhere in his sentencing remarks did his Honour refer to the standard non-parole period for the offence in question. The Crown contended that s 101A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act should apply. That section provides as follows:
	


“101A    Effect of failure to comply with Act

A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	It is an error for a sentencing judge to fail to take account of a specified standard non-parole period in determining an appropriate sentence. However, the mere failure by a sentencing judge specifically to refer to a matter to which consideration ought to have been given, or to which some reference might merely have been expected, such as a standard non-parole period, does not of itself amount to an error or constitute a ground of appeal. Rather, the failure to do so is a matter that might possibly or even reliably inform a different ground of appeal, such as a failure to give reasons or a complaint that a particular sentence is manifestly excessive or inadequate. That is what the Crown says occurred here. The Crown in effect contends that even if his Honour’s failure to refer to the standard non-parole period was not itself a discrete error, the absence of any mention of it bespeaks or at least suggests error, subsisting in the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate. The same may be said of a failure to record reasons for imposing a non-custodial sentence.
	
	
	It is of course well accepted that a standard non-parole period is an important marker to be taken into account in the sentencing process. In my opinion, however, the proper characterisation of a failure to refer to a standard non-parole period is not as an error as such but as one possible indication that the sentence in question may be demonstrably erroneous. The issue of whether a standard non-parole period is or is not specifically mentioned involves no independent assessment or process of evaluation, in contrast, for example, to the expression of an opinion or finding with respect to the objective seriousness of an offence. I note in this context that the Crown specifically submitted that his Honour’s “failure to comply with sections 54B and 54C [was]... another step in a significantly flawed sentencing process.” In my opinion, his Honour’s failure to refer in terms to the standard non-parole period and his failure to record his reasons for ordering a non-custodial sentence in the present case should be treated in that way. The very sentence imposed by his Honour evidences a failure properly to take account of these things.
	
	
	I would also in this context wish specifically to record that I would not lightly or hastily come to a conclusion that an experienced criminal lawyer and judge such his Honour would have been unaware of the importance of a standard non-parole period in sentencing a person for a serious offence where a standard non-parole period applied. The same may be said of the need to record reasons for imposing a non-custodial sentence. It is important to note that judges in all jurisdictions in general, but in the District Court in particular, with their significant workloads and correspondingly onerous responsibilities, ought not to be criticised by overly technical analyses of the minutiae of their remarks when somewhat broader and more significant factors are at play. In the present case it is also important to bear in mind that his Honour’s error was not in failing to mention or refer to the relevant standard non-parole period or to record reasons but in the extension of leniency that in the end could not be justified.
	


The sentence was manifestly inadequate and the objective seriousness of the offence was not adequately assessed


	
	It is convenient to consider these two grounds together.
	
	
	His Honour expressed the view that the offending was “a little below the mid line seriousness.” It is apparent that his Honour understood, and gave consideration to, the importance of assessing where the particular offence lay in the range of objective seriousness for offences of this type. The Crown does not complain that his Honour’s assessment was erroneous, but does complain that the assessment could not justify the sentence that was actually imposed.
	
	
	With the significant advantage of the CCTV footage, which his Honour ought to have viewed, it is apparent that Mr Mulligan was the aggressor. The victim was a man approaching 60 years of age, inoffensively walking his dogs on a Saturday morning. From shortly following the initial incident with the dogs, he remained stationary, leaning passively against a motor vehicle during the events complained of, never offering or implying a physical threat or resistance of any kind. Although Mr Mulligan’s height and weight were matters of apparent contention before his Honour, it is now clear that he was well built and muscular and obviously very fit. In my view, Mr Mulligan also appeared ominously familiar with boxing or fighting, having regard to the way in which he shaped up to the victim before striking him. Mr Mulligan also somewhat ironically presented himself with several opportunities to retreat from the looming confrontation but he unfortunately chose to take advantage of none of them. The ferocity of the assault is clearly to be seen in the seriousness of the damage that his punches inflicted.
	
	
	His Honour made a series of findings that are impugned by the Crown. His Honour considered that Mr Mulligan was unable to control his emotions because he considered that his dog was at risk. Whilst the former is patently correct, the latter is demonstrably false. Mr Mulligan’s dog was well removed from any danger long before the assault took place. Mr Mulligan was also not, contrary to his Honour’s finding, small or of a very small build. Nor, to the extent that it could ever have been relevant, was the victim strongly built around the shoulders. His Honour felt that he was unable to determine who between Mr Mulligan or the victim was more responsible for the initial confrontation. The events depicted in the CCTV footage make it clear that Mr Mulligan was wholly responsible for it. Even if it were accepted for the sake of argument that the victim had goaded or taunted Mr Mulligan in the way suggested by him in his evidence before his Honour, the response it generated was wholly disproportionate to anything that might have been said.
	
	
	To some extent, however, all of this is beside the point. His Honour’s assessment of the level of seriousness of the offence is not put in issue by either party in this Court. It was conceded on behalf of Mr Mulligan in the sentencing proceedings that it was open to his Honour “to find the offence [fell] within the mid-range of objective seriousness” and he did not seek to resile from that contention in this Court. Factors tending to inform the objective seriousness of the offence do not in the particular circumstances of this appeal therefore warrant undue analysis. What does require consideration in my view is the manner in which Mr Mulligan’s subjective case was utilised by his Honour in arriving at his conclusions. The Crown contended that his Honour gave excessive weight to subjective features. I agree.
	
	
	His Honour described Mr Mulligan’s subjective features as “overwhelming”. The Crown’s written submissions dealt with that description in terms that warrant reproduction here:
	


“The Crown submits that his Honour’s hyperbole is in itself a reflection of his failure to balance [Mr Mulligan’s] subjective features with all of the other sentencing considerations, particularly the objective seriousness of the offending. It is true that [Mr Mulligan] was able to place evidence before the court which was favourable to his prospects of rehabilitation, but none of it could be described as exceptional let alone ‘overwhelming’. In coming to his conclusion about [Mr Mulligan’s] subjective matters, his Honour paid little regard to [his] prior history of convictions for violence and antisocial behaviour, one [example] of which resulted in a prison sentence in his native Ireland. Furthermore, [Mr Mulligan] has been convicted of two such offences since his arrival in Australia in 2008, the most recent of which was May 2015.”


	
	The Crown conceded that Mr Mulligan’s criminal history was relatively minor when compared to the offence for which he was sentenced but was nevertheless inconsistent with an overwhelming subjective case. His Honour would have been aware that Mr Mulligan had received the benefit of a suspended sentence in Ireland on a charge of assault. Since then Mr Mulligan has committed further offences involving antisocial, offensive and aggressive conduct. The Crown contended that it was in these circumstances “contrary to principle” to impose a suspended sentence.
	
	
	Nor was the expert medical evidence of particular assistance to Mr Mulligan. His Honour correctly ascertained that Mr Mulligan’s “emotions took over” when the offence was committed. Dr Nielssen did not, however, affirmatively diagnose impulse control disorder, but instead considered a form of such a disorder as a possible diagnosis. His Honour did not find, nor is it suggested by Mr Mulligan that he ought to have found, that he was suffering from a medical condition that effectively explained his offending behaviour.
	
	
	In my opinion, the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly inadequate. In expressing that view I acknowledge that a claim of manifest inadequacy requires this Court to be satisfied that the sentence imposed by his Honour was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markahan v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. The seriousness of the assault is adequately reflected in the injuries that it caused. The offending cannot be explained and certainly cannot be excused. Even if Mr Mulligan were entitled to the benefit of some kind of provocation, his violent response was entirely disproportionate. In the way in which the Crown approached this point, the degree of provocation did not sufficiently mitigate the seriousness of the offence to justify the lenient sentence actually imposed. Mr Mulligan’s modest criminal history is not particularly significant in the scheme of things but neither does it positively assist him and it certainly could not generate an enthusiasm for leniency of the type that his Honour was minded to extend.
	


Section 95 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	Section 95 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:
	


“95 Good behaviour bonds

A good behaviour bond:

(a)   must contain a condition to the effect that the offender to whom the bond relates (the ‘person under bond’) will appear before the court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond, and

(b)   must contain a condition to the effect that, during the term of the bond, the person under bond will be of good behaviour, and

(c)   may contain such other conditions as are specified in the order by which the bond is imposed, other than conditions requiring the person under bond:

(i)    to perform community service work, or

(ii)    to make any payment, whether in the nature of a fine, compensation or otherwise.”


	
	The Crown submitted that his Honour had no power to require Mr Mulligan to pay compensation to the victim as a condition of the bond. That submission is not contested. Having regard to the view I have formed about the adequacy of his Honour’s sentence, and my conclusions concerning re-sentencing, it becomes unnecessary to consider the effect, if any, of this error upon the sentencing outcome. I observe in passing, however, that his Honour could legitimately have made an order for compensation pursuant to s 97 of the Victims Rights and Support Act 2013.
	


The residual discretion


	
	The Crown bears the onus of negating any reason why the residual discretion of this Court should be exercised to dismiss the appeal even though appellable error has been demonstrated: CMB v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308.
	
	
	In R v O’Connor [2014] NSWCCA 53, Adamson J commented upon the residual discretion as follows:
	


“[85] This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.

[86] This Court is obliged to consider the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [24]; Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57 at [10], [12], [60]-[61].

…

[88] Although the principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges, the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is still of considerable importance. The need for specific deterrence in the present case would not be served by an exercise of the residual discretion.

[89] Nor indeed would the need for general deterrence be fulfilled were the residual discretion to be exercised. The general deterrence of a sentence is not to be measured solely by reference to its effect on putative offenders. One of the purposes of incorporating an element of general deterrence in a sentence is to ensure that sentences accord with legitimate community expectations and that public confidence in the administration of justice is maintained: Markahan v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [82] per McHugh J...”


	
	The Crown contended that there had been no relevant delay in the institution of the appeal, and no delay in the disposition of the appeal appeared to be imminent. The Crown’s appeal was filed and served less than a week following the sentence proceedings and was listed for hearing in this Court within five months thereafter. The errors established by the Crown were not caused or perpetuated by it. Moreover, there is no post-sentence material from Mr Mulligan that affects or changes any of the matters that were current when he was sentenced.
	
	
	Mr Mulligan submitted that this was a case in which there remained scope for the extension of leniency. Mr Mulligan could point to all but three of the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, indicating the availability of grounds upon which this Court could exercise a very favourable sentencing discretion.
	
	
	Section 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that on a Crown appeal against a sentence this Court “may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper.” This Court has what has been described as a lively discretion to refuse to intervene, even where error has been shown.
	
	
	In my opinion, the predominant consideration in the particular circumstances of this case should be the sentence that was actually imposed upon Mr Mulligan. It was manifestly inadequate. An exercise of the residual discretion in this case would not give effect to the need either for general or specific deterrence. It is difficult to accept that general community standards would sit comfortably with a decision that confirmed the appropriateness of the original sentence.
	


The proper sentence


	
	Section 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is in these terms:
	


“68A Double jeopardy not to be taken into account in prosecution appeals against sentence

(1)   An appeal court must not:

(a)   dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or

(b)   impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate,

because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again.

(2)   This section extends to an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.”


	
	Section 68A was authoritatively considered by a five judge bench in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7. At [96]-[98], Spigelman CJ said this:
	


“The Substituted Sentence

[96] The second element of double jeopardy, being the constraint on the sentence the Court imposes if it decides to intervene, is well established. It has been expressed in a number of different formulations:

●    ‘towards the lower end of the range of available sentences’ (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [62] per Kirby J);

●    ‘the least sentence that could properly have been imposed’ (R v Rose NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 May 1996, unreported per Gleeson CJ, applied in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 232);

●    ‘one which is at the bottom of the range’ (R v Giam (No 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378; (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 at [28] per Dunford J);

●    ‘usually requires a discount to be applied by this Court ... the extent of that discount varies according to the individual circumstances subjective to the respondent’ (R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80 per Hunt CJ at CL);

●    ‘a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance’ (R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562 per Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and Mclnerney J);

●    ‘there is no tariff for the discount for the double jeopardy involved’ (Comptroller-General of Customs v D’Aquino Bros Pty Ltd (1996) 130 FLR 383 at 403; (1996) 85 A Crim R 517 at 538);

●    ‘generally less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court’ and ‘generally ... towards the lower end of the available range’ (R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at [70] per Wood CJ at CL, with whom Meagher JA and Bell J agreed).

[97] It is unnecessary to attempt to reconcile these different formulations. The basic principle was well established and, as the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and Mclnerney J in Allpass supra expressly stated at 562, the reduction in the sentence that the Court considered ought to have been imposed is an application of the double jeopardy principle.

[98] This aspect of the concept of double jeopardy was not controversial in the submissions in this Court. It was clearly a sentencing principle applicable to each individual case in which the exercise of a discretion under s 5D arises. It has been removed by s 68A. The intention to do was made quite clear in the Second Reading speeches, where each Parliamentary Secretary said in each House:

‘... even where appeal courts have decided to intervene and impose a new sentence, under this principle they have historically imposed sentences that are less than that which they would otherwise have imposed, again on the basis that the prisoner is facing being sentenced for the second time. The Double Jeopardy Law Reform Working Group, which reported to COAG, considered this issue. They gave weight to the argument that, where an appeal court finds that a sentence imposed at first instance is inadequate, but through the operation of sentencing principles (in particular the principle of ‘sentencing double jeopardy’) the inadequacy remains uncorrected, this does not serve the community’s interest in seeing crimes appropriately punished.

The Government agrees, and the provision in the bill will make sure that where an offender has received too lenient a sentence because of an error made by the sentencing court, an appropriate sentence will be imposed on appeal, because the court will not be bound to give an ‘automatic discount’ because the offender is being sentenced a second time for the same offence.’” [Emphasis added]


	
	This position has been reaffirmed in decisions since then. For example, McClellan CJ at CL said this in R v Parkinson [2014] NSWCCA 89 at [49] and [51]:
	


“[49] The principles which have traditionally applied to a Crown appeal against sentence are well known. They were summarised in R v Wall (2002) NSWCCA 42 at [70]. However, following the enactment of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009 those principles have changed. Although considerations relating to matters of double jeopardy are no longer relevant this Court retains a discretion not to intervene: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49.

…

[51] Although before the amending Act sentences at the lowest end of the range should be imposed by this Court this is no longer the case: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA49...”


	
	To the extent that any different view may appear to have been expressed in other cases, it should be disregarded. For example, the matter was considered by this Court in R v Mereb; R v Younan [2014] NSWCCA 149 at [30]-[31] as follows:
	


“[30] The Crown accepted that as a Crown appeal, the Court needed to be mindful of the principles which govern Crown appeals generally. The Crown accepted that the relevant principles were summarised by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Meagher JA and Bell J agreed) in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]:

‘70 ... it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence:

(a)...

(d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561, R v Papazis (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and Wong and Leung v The Queen at para 110.

(e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court: R v Holder and Johnston (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen at para 62.’

[31] Leaving aside the reference to double jeopardy (Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638), those principles remain valid and were restated by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462...”


	
	However, it is apparent that the Court in that case was not referred to R v JW. Moreover, In R v Lin [2014] NSWCCA 254, Bellew J referred to the lesser sentence principle with a reference to R v Holder & Johnston at 256, but his Honour similarly made no reference to R v JW. Inasmuch as it is clear that the reference in R v Holder & Johnston at 255-256 is in fact a direct application of the double jeopardy principle, it has now been decisively dealt with by s 68A(1)(b) and the unanimous five judge decision in R v JW. The decisions in R v Mereb and R v Lin have to be read in light of the fact that the authoritative decision on this topic in R v JW was not brought to the attention of the Court.
	
	
	Although it is common in cases such as this to be referred to statistical material and comparable cases, the only statistics available in this Court were derived from sentences imposed in the Local Court. Those statistics were inapplicable to proceedings in the District Court. Nevertheless, counsel then appearing for Mr Mulligan relied on them (without correction by the Crown) in support of a submission that “some 63 percent of such matters are dealt with by way of other than custody and some 32 percent by way of suspended sentence, suspended sentence with supervision or intensive correction order.” To be clear, it is not suggested that the erroneous reliance on Local Court statistics before the sentencing judge was other than inadvertent. However, as has been said on more than one occasion, care needs to be taken in order not to misuse sentencing statistics: see Knight v R [2015] NSWCCA 222 at [3]-[13] and [86]-[89] and, for an error not dissimilar to the present case, see Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [87]-[97]. This appeal is another example.
	
	
	The random and unpredictable nature of the violence perpetrated upon an innocent victim in this case necessarily attracts a significant degree of general deterrence. Correspondingly, even though the pre-sentence report prepared by Ute Geissler dated 5 August 2015 assessed Mr Mulligan as having a low risk of re-offending, and accepting that Mr Mulligan pleaded guilty to the offence, there remains a need for specific deterrence, particularly having regard to his demonstrated inability to control his violent impulses. There is also a need to reflect an appropriate degree of retribution when the difficult ongoing condition of the victim is taken into account.
	
	
	In my opinion a proper starting point is a sentence of 2 years imprisonment. Mr Mulligan is entitled to a 25 percent discount for his early guilty plea. He is also entitled to a variation of the statutory ratio, having regard to what I consider to be a need for psychological intervention and counselling of the type identified by Ms Geissler.
	


Orders


	
	I consider that the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ on 30 October 2015.
	
	
	In lieu thereof, sentence David Mulligan to a non-parole term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing on 1 April 2016 expiring on 31 March 2017 and to a balance of term of 6 months expiring on 30 September 2017.

		01 April 2016",2016-03-31 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2701866,R v Rogerson; R v McNamara (No 37) [2016] NSWSC 304,"Judgment EX TEMPORE – REVISED


	
	On 8 March 2016, at the request of the solicitor for Rogerson, I issued a subpoena to Dr Robert Hampshire, a medical practitioner, for the production of (inter alia) the following:
	


“All medical records and documents concerning Paul Charles Kenny (DOB: 27/12/1953) including but not limited to any/all clinical notes; referrals, admission and discharge summaries and referrals to psychiatric hospitals and facilities; clinical notes, file notes; reports, assessments, medication prescription, medical certificates and other documents relating to any/all diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of Mr Kenny.”


	
	The subpoena was returnable before the Court on 11 March, at which time documents were produced by Dr Hampshire. Given the terms of that part of the schedule to the subpoena set out in [1] above, I took the liberty of undertaking a very brief examination of the material which was produced. It seemed to me that the nature of that material was such that Mr Kenny should be given the opportunity of having access to it in the first instance, in order to determine whether he wished to make an application pursuant to s. 126B of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (“the Act”).
	
	
	I caused an email to be sent to Mr Kenny to that effect on the afternoon of 11 March 2016. His solicitor, Mr O'Brien, subsequently confirmed that Mr Kenny sought first access to the material. That access was granted, following which Mr O'Brien indicated that an application would be made pursuant to s. 126B of the Act for the exclusion of evidence of protected confidences which were contained in the material produced. On that occasion I asked Mr O’Brien that he make clear in due course those parts of the material in respect of which the application was to be made.
	
	
	The application was made today on Mr Kenny’s behalf by Mr Steirn SC. In support of the application Mr Steirn tendered an email from Dr Hampshire of 20 March 2016, to which I will return.
	
	
	The Crown tendered (notionally at least) a transcript of evidence given before me on a pre-trial application heard in 2015 which included evidence given by Mr Kenny.
	
	
	In order to put the present application into its proper context, it is necessary for me to set out some background.
	
	
	In early 2015, before this trial commenced, I was notified that Ms Jessica McNamara, the daughter of the accused McNamara, had given a statement to the police, but objected to giving evidence under s. 18 of the Act. I heard evidence from Ms McNamara in May 2015 in support of that application. In the course of her evidence (commencing at T40 L7 of the proceedings on 12 May 2015) Ms McNamara explained that one of the bases of her application was that she feared for her own personal safety, as well as that of other members of her family. According to Ms McNamara the source of that fear (at least in part) was a conversation she had with Mr Kenny, who was then the solicitor for Rogerson. She gave evidence (at T42 L11-12) that Mr Kenny had said to her:
	


""It's not the Triads you need to be afraid of, its Roger. He knows where you live. They could just jump over and go through the windows"".


	
	Mr Kenny also gave evidence on the application under s. 18. With the benefit of a certificate issued under s. 128 of the Act, he effectively conceded (commencing at T 142 L1) that had said to Ms McNamara at least some of the words that she had attributed to him. Mr Kenny said that there had been ""more to the conversation"" he had with Ms McNamara, although when asked what else he had said he was unable to give any further detail.
	
	
	Ultimately, I upheld Ms McNamara’s objection: R v Rogerson, R v McNamara (No 1) (2015) NSWSC 592. In the course of that judgment I found (at [71]) that on the evidence before me, Mr Kenny had used the words attributed to him by Ms McNamara, and in doing so had threatened her.
	
	
	Subsequently, for reasons which remain unexplained, Ms McNamara withdrew her objection. She is presently giving evidence in the trial.
	
	
	In the course of cross-examining Ms McNamara before the jury, counsel for Rogerson elicited evidence of her conversations with Mr Kenny. The Crown has now indicated that he will call Mr Kenny to give evidence once Ms McNamara’s evidence has concluded.
	
	
	It was against that background that the subpoena was issued to Dr Hampshire, and the documentation produced. It can be reasonably expected that when Mr Kenny gives evidence he will be cross-examined by counsel for Rogerson about his conversations with Ms McNamara. It can also be reasonably expected that it will be put to him that anything he may have said to Ms McNamara was not said at Rogerson’s behest.
	
	
	When the hearing of the application commenced before me this morning, Mr Steirn directed me to an envelope marked ""privilege"", which was said to contain the material in respect of which the application was made. That material comprised a bundle of documents. Regrettably, no attempt was made by those acting for Mr Kenny to identify those parts of the documents which were said to disclose a protected confidence. Even on the most cursory examination, there are some parts of them which could not possibly attract the provisions of s. 126B. It has essentially been left to me to determine which parts may be caught by the provisions of that section.
	
	
	It must be said that the manner in which the present application has been approached by those acting for Mr Kenny has been less than helpful. It has placed a far greater burden on the Court than should ever have been the case. Approaching an application such as this in a blanket and all-encompassing way completely fails to have regard to the fact that in directing itself to documents, s. 126B does so only to the extent that such documents disclose a protected confidence. Simply because there may, within a document, be evidence of a protected confidence does not mean that evidence of the entirety of the document should be excluded: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 166; (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at [257]; 729 per James J.
	
	
	Section 126B is in the following terms:
	


126B   Exclusion of evidence of protected confidences

(1)  The court may direct that evidence not be adduced in a proceeding if the court finds that adducing it would disclose:

(a)  a protected confidence, or

(b)  the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, or

(c)  protected identity information.

(2)  The court may give such a direction:

(a)  on its own initiative, or

(b)  on the application of the protected confider or confidant concerned (whether or not either is a party).

(3)  The court must give such a direction if it is satisfied that:

(a)  it is likely that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to a protected confider if the evidence is adduced, and

(b)  the nature and extent of the harm outweighs the desirability of the evidence being given.

(4)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of this section, it is to take into account the following matters:

(a)  the probative value of the evidence in the proceeding,

(b)  the importance of the evidence in the proceeding,

(c)  the nature and gravity of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding,

(d)  the availability of any other evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence or protected identity information relates,

(e)  the likely effect of adducing evidence of the protected confidence or protected identity information, including the likelihood of harm, and the nature and extent of harm that would be caused to the protected confider,

(f)  the means (including any ancillary orders that may be made under section 126E) available to the court to limit the harm or extent of the harm that is likely to be caused if evidence of the protected confidence or the protected identity information is disclosed,

(g)  if the proceeding is a criminal proceeding—whether the party seeking to adduce evidence of the protected confidence or protected identity information is a defendant or the prosecutor,

(h)  whether the substance of the protected confidence or the protected identity information has already been disclosed by the protected confider or any other person,

(i)  the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences,

(j)  the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected identity information.

(5)  The court must state its reasons for giving or refusing to give a direction under this section.


	
	Section 126A contains two particular definitions which are relevant for present purposes. The first is the definition of the term ""protected confidence"":
	


“protected confidence means a communication made by a person in confidence to another person (in this Division called the confidant):

(a)  in the course of a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity, and

(b)  when the confidant was under an express or implied obligation not to disclose its contents, whether or not the obligation arises under law or can be inferred from the nature of the relationship between the person and the confidant.”


	
	The second is the definition of the word ""harm"":
	


“harm includes actual physical bodily harm, financial loss, stress or shock, damage to reputation or emotional or psychological harm (such as shame, humiliation and fear).”


	
	Generally speaking, the documentation produced by Dr Hampshire consists of clinical notes, reports, correspondence, and test results regarding particular aspects of Mr Kenny's health. As previously noted, Dr Hampshire provided a report which was tendered to me in support of the application and which includes the following:
	


“ … you asked if I thought my clinical notes would result in psychological harm to my patient. I think there is a very real risk that they could. They could embarrass him and/or damage his standing within the legal profession within which he works. They could also cause damage to his referral patterns in the broader population upon which he is reliant for his ongoing career.”


	
	I reiterate that whilst Dr Hampshire opined that disclosure of his “clinical notes” may result in harm to Mr Kenny, s. 126B is directed to protected confidences, not whole documents.
	
	
	Section 126B creates a judicial discretion, as opposed to a privilege: Wilson v the State of New South Wales [2003] NSWSC 805 at [18]. The nature of the section generally, and the interplay between subs 126(1) and (3), is explained by authors of ""Uniform Evidence in Australia"" (at [126B-2]):
	


“There is great latitude in the Court's powers in subs (1). It is obliged to consider at least the matters set out in subs (4) and also the matters in s. 192(2), but is not limited to those matters, and in any event has a discretion whether or not to make the direction, subject to subs (3). By contrast, if the Court is satisfied of the matters in subs (3) it has no discretion whether to give a direction. Subsection (3) requires a court to direct that evidence of a protected confidence not be adduced if the judge is satisfied that if the evidence was given it is likely that harm might be caused (directly or indirectly) to a protected confider and the nature and extent of the harm outweighs the desirability of the evidence being given.”


	
	As I understand it, senior counsel for Mr Kenny relied primarily upon the provisions of subs. (3) of s. 126B. Although subs. (3) is in mandatory terms (as evidenced by the use of the word “must”) it seems to me that the factors set out in subs. (4) are relevant to the determination which is required to be made by subs. (3)(b). I have considered each of those factors.
	
	
	Firstly, in light of the fact that Mr Kenny has admitted using some of the words attributed to him by Ms McNamara, I consider that the probative value of the evidence over which the claim is made is limited (subs 4(a)).
	
	
	Secondly, and for similar reasons, the importance of the evidence in the proceedings is limited (subs. 4(b)).
	
	
	Thirdly, I have taken into account the nature and gravity of the alleged offences (subs 4. (c)). They are obviously serious.
	
	
	Fourthly, I have taken into account the fact that there is no other evidence touching upon the confidences which are sought to be protected (subs. 4(d)).
	
	
	Fifthly, I have had regard to the likely effect of the disclosure of the protected confidences upon Mr Kenny (subs. 4(e)). Leaving aside the fact that there may be harm to his legal practice (which would fall within the definition of “harm” in s. 126A of the Act) Dr Hampshire's unequivocal view is that there is a real risk that disclosure of his clinical notes (and, I infer, the disclosure of any similar or related material) could result in psychological harm to Mr Kenny. As I have already observed, the section is not directed to the exclusion of documents. However, to the extent that any of the material discloses a protected confidence, the importance and significance of Dr Hampshire’s opinion will be obvious without any further comment.
	
	
	Sixthly, I have taken into account what means might be available to limit the extent of the harm that is likely to be caused to Mr Kenny if evidence of the protected confidence was disclosed (subs. 4(f)). There is, of course, power to order that the Court be closed for the purposes of the evidence being given. There is also power to a make a suppression or non-publication order. Whilst those orders could ameliorate the potential harm to Mr Kenny's practice, they would seemingly do little to ameliorate what has been identified by Dr Hampshire as the real risk of psychological harm.
	
	
	Seventhly, I have had regard to the fact that these are criminal proceedings and that the evidence is sought to be adduced on behalf of one of accused (subs. 4(g)). In this respect there is a necessity to bear firmly in mind the right of the accused to a fair trial.
	
	
	Eighthly, I have taken into account the fact that on the basis of the evidence which is before me there has been no disclosure of any of the material over which the claim is made, either by Mr Kenny or any other person (subs. 4(h)).
	
	
	I am satisfied that if evidence of those parts of the material which disclose a protected confidence were adduced, it is likely that harm of the kind to which Dr Hampshire refers would, or might, be caused to Mr Kenny. I am also satisfied, having taken into account all of the factors in subs. (4), that the nature and extent of that harm, particularly insofar as it relates to psychological harm, outweighs the desirability of evidence of protected confidences being given. In particular, the probative value of such evidence, and its importance, is limited for the reasons I have given.
	
	
	Because of the unsatisfactory manner in which this application has been conducted, and because there is a need to deal with the matter expeditiously to ensure that trial continues without interruption, I have redacted from the material produced those parts of it which in my view disclose a protected confidence, and in respect of which I have determined that the present application should be granted. I will provide Mr Kenny's legal representatives with a copy of the redacted material. If there is any further issue to be raised, it will be necessary for Mr Kenny's solicitor or senior counsel to appear before the Court at 10am tomorrow to make any further application.
	
	
	Finally, I should note that senior counsel for Mr Kenny submitted that if I concluded that the application should be granted in respect of any of the material produced, such conclusion should extend and apply to any question asked of Mr Kenny about the general subject matter of his health. I do not accept that submission. The section, as I have said, applies to evidence of protected confidences as defined. Subject to questions of relevance, it is not difficult to envisage that a question might be asked of Mr Kenny about this general issue, the answer to which would not disclose evidence of a protected confidence and would therefore fall outside the provisions of s. 126B.
	
	
	Accordingly, it should be clearly understood that my present determination is limited to the protected confidences which I have determined are disclosed in the material which was the subject of the application. In light of that determination, those who act for Mr Kenny should take whatever course they consider appropriate to protect Mr Kenny's interests in respect of any question(s) put to him in cross-examination.
	
	
	For these reasons, and subject to any further application being made, I order that the redacted portions of the material produced by Dr Hampshire be excluded pursuant to s. 126B of the Act.
